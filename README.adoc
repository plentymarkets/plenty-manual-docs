Welcome to the plenty-manual-docs project.
This project contains the source files of the plentymarkets documentation.
The documentation is available at link:[knowledge.plentymarkets.com^].
The documentation is written in link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoc^] and published using the content management system link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[Antora^], version 2.3.

WARNING: This repository will be made private in the near future. Please create an issue in this repository if you see any reasons against this decision.

== Local development

Antora makes it easy to generate the site in your local environment.
You just have to clone this repository and perform the setup from this section.
When you generate the site locally, you can check what your changes are going to look like before publishing them.
This section describes how to carry out the following steps:

* Installing Antora locally
* Configuring a local playbook
* Running Antora to generate the site

NOTE: Translatable layout elements are rendered locally as "Lorem ipsum".
This includes the links in the header and footer, among others.

=== Installing Antora

You can install Antora via an npm package.
Before you can install npm packages, you need a Node.js release.

To install Antora, carry out the following steps:

. If you don't already have Node.js, link:https://nodejs.org/en/download/[download the latest LTS version^].
. Open the terminal (command line) in VS Code.
. Run the command `npm install` +
icon:arrow-right[] This installs the required Antora packages and creates local playbooks.

For other installation methods, refer to the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install/install-antora/[Antora documentation^].

=== Configuring a local playbook

Every Antora project has a playbook.
The playbook is a set of configurations that determines how Antora compiles the documentation site.
The configuration includes the locations of the content and the layout.
It also specifies what Asciidoc attributes to apply globally and any libraries that extend core functionality.

The published website has two playbooks, one for the English part of the site and one for the German part:

* `antora-playbook-de.yml`
* `antora-playbook-en.yml`

For generating the site locally, it's best to add your own personal playbook.
You can find playbook templates in the `templates` folder.
When installing the packages, a script automatically copies the playbooks to the project root.
As long as you don't modify the file names, they're ignored by version control.
This means you can experiment with the configuration as you want, without accidentally pushing it to remote and affecting the live environment.

You can use the playbooks as they are or modify them to suit your needs.
For further information on the available configuration options, refer to the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/playbook/set-up-playbook/[Antora documentation^].

=== Running Antora

With Antora installed and your playbooks configured, you can now generate the documentation locally.

Each time you want to generate the documentation, carry out the following steps:

. Open the terminal (command line) in VS Code.
. Change directory to the plenty-manual-docs project.
. Run the command `npm run dev:de` or `npm run dev:en`, depending on which language you want to generate. You can also use the command `npm run dev` to generate both languages. +
icon:arrow-right[] Antora generates the documentation.
You can find the output in the `build` folder of the project.

NOTE: Just like the local playbooks, the build folder is ignored by version control.

== Project structure

This section covers the overall structure of the project.
It explains some core Antora concepts and functionality and addresses how the project differs from the standard use case.

To gain a more in-depth understanding of Antora, refer to the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[Antora documentation^].

=== Multilingual support

By default, Antora doesn't support multilingual projects yet.
This project uses a workaround solution to provide support in more than one language.
The workaround consists of generating separate sites, one for each language.
The sites are combined when uploading the files to the website hosting service.
Finally, the root `index.html` provides an entry point to the site from the base URL.

Proper multilingual support is discussed in the link:https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/issues/208[Antora project on GitLab^].

=== Components

A component describes a distinct part of a project.
Each component has its own versioning.
To an extent, every component can also be configured separately from the rest of the site.

For further information on components, refer to the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/component-version/[Antora documentation^].
For an overview of the current project components, refer to the playbook YAML files.

=== Modules

Each component contains one or more modules.
Modules allow you to organise content within a component, for example by product.
Each module may contain pages, as well as different families of resources.

There's two types of modules: the ROOT module and any number of named modules.
The main difference is that when generating a page's URL, ROOT module pages are considered the top level pages of the component.
When a page is treated as a top level page, the name of the module isn't included in the page's URL.

Each module contains various file families.

For further information on modules, refer to the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/module-directories/[Antora documentation^].

=== File families & IDs

Each file in an Antora project has a unique ID.
The ID can be used to link to a page or to reference a resource.
Resource include the following families:

* Attachments (currently not used)
* Examples
* Images
* Pages
* Partials

Depending on the resource family, you can add the resource with the `image` or `include` macro.

In general, the ID of a file depends on where that file is located in the Antora project structure.
This means the ID contains the file's version, component, module and file name.
In the case of resources, the ID also contains the resource family.

[source,Asciidoc]
----
// Page ID pattern
version@component:module:page.adoc

// Page ID example
main@manual:plugins:faq-plugins.adoc

// Resource ID pattern

main@manual:app:page$functions.adoc
main@manual:data:partial$catalogues-faq.adoc
----

It's not necessary to specify the `version`, `component` and `module` if they're identical to the current file.

For further information on link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-id/[page IDs^] and link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/resource-id/[resource IDs^], refer to the Antora documentation.

=== Redirects

When the ID of a page changes, it's useful to add a redirect from the old to the new destination.
You can add a redirect with the `:page-aliases:` attribute.
The attribute contains a comma separated list of IDs.
Each list entry represents a former ID of the page.

It's not necessary to specify the `version`, `component` and `module` if they're identical to the current file.

For further information on page aliases and redirects, refer to the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-aliases/[Antora documentation^].

WARNING: As mentioned in the Antora documentation, the page aliases attribute shouldn't be used for bulk redirects.
For example, when moving many pages to a new component, it's better to create a redirect via the website host.
For further details, contact an administrator.

=== Links

There are three types of links:

* Links to an anchor on the same page
* Links to a different page on the site
* Links to a page on a different site

Depending on the type of link, the link has to be formatted differently.
The following table describes the formatting for each link type.

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Link type |Formatting |Reference

|Page anchor
|`+<<anchor-id,link label>>+` +
`+<<create-contact,Creating a contact>>+`
|link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/xref/[Cross references^]

|Different page
|`+xref:version@component:module:filename.adoc[link label]+` +
`+xref:main@manual:plugins:faq-plugins.adoc[plugins FAQ]+`

It's not necessary to specify the `version`, `component` and `module` if they're identical to the current page.
|link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/navigation/xrefs-and-link-text/[Page xrefs and link text^]

|Different site
|`+link:target-url[link label]+` +
`+link:https://www.plentymarkets.com/[plentymarkets]+` +
`+link:{url-plentymarkets}[plentymarkets]+`

For easier localisation, external URLs should be encoded in an attribute.
For a complete example, refer to the reference on troubleshooting complex URLs.

== Supported functionality

This project supports the default link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoc^] and link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[Antora^] functionality.
In addition, the following features are available:

* Material icons
* Overview pages
* Search index settings
* Tabs

This section describes how to use these features in greater detail.

=== Material icons

Asciidoc and Antora support Font Awesome 4.7 icons by default.
The inline icon extension extends the icon support with Google Material icons.

To add a Material icon, carry out the following steps:

. Check the link:https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline[Material icons guide^] to determine the name of the icon, for example `add_shopping_cart`.
. To include the icon on a page, use the pattern +
`+material:add_shopping_cart[]+`.
. If you want to colour the icon, add the colour via the `role` attribute: +
`+material:add_shopping_cart[role=red]+`.

The following colours are available:

[cols="3"]
|===
|Role name |Colour group |Colour code

|`blue`
|Active
|`#3f54d0`

|`skyBlue`
|Info
|`#24b3e0`

|`green`
|Add
|`#6ad26a`

|`orange`
|Warning
|`#ff873e`

|`purple`
|Transfer
|`#e468f3`

|`red`
|Alert
|`#f11539`

|`yellow`
|Action
|`#ffdb4c`

|===

NOTE: The colours and colour groups represent the way colours are used in the plentymarkets UI.
The styling of elements on plentymarkets websites may be different.

=== Overview pages

Some pages only serve as an entry point to a section or subsection.
These pages may not need a lot of content and only include an overview of the other pages in the section.

To generate the contents of an overview page automatically, you can add the `:page-layout: overview` attribute to the document header.
Once published, the page will include a standard phrase and a list of child pages with links.

=== Search index settings

By default, the search engine indexes every page on the website.
However, in some cases it's better if the engine skips a page during indexing.
An example are changelog pages.
When indexed, changelog pages tend to clutter up the search results.
Therefore, the pages should be excluded from indexing.

There are two ways to influence if the engine indexes a page:

* *Attribute*:
You can add the attribute `:page-index: false` to the document header.
Setting the `page-index` attribute to `false` adds the `noindex` and `nofollow` robots tags to the page.
* *Page ID*:
If the ID of the page contains the string `+/_+`, the engine skips that page during indexing.
For example, the ID of every page in the `_includes` module has the pattern `{component}/{version}/_includes/{page}`.
The pattern contains the string `+/_+`.
As a result, no page in the `_includes` module is indexed.

The attribute works across all search engines.
The page ID exception only works with the current setup.
To make it easy to potentially use other search engines in the future, using the attribute is preferable.

CAUTION: If the index already contains a page, setting the attribute doesn't remove the page from the index.
Instead, you have to remove the page from the index manually.
However, deleted and redirected pages are removed automatically.

=== Tabs

The tabs block extension provides tabs support.
The extension was created by OpenDevise Inc. and is distributed under the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

To add a tabs block to a page, use the following formatting:

[source, Asciidoc]
----
[tabs]
====
Tab A::
+
--
Contents of tab A.
--
Tab B::
+
--
Contents of tab B.
--
====
----

NOTE: If you want to use another block inside a tabs block, refer to the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/delimited/#nesting[nested block formatting rules^] of the Asciidoc documentation.
