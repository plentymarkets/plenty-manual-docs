== How are items reshelved?

All of the items start out in the same spot. For example, maybe cashiers put returned items in a box behind the sales counter. Or maybe there’s a special area in your warehouse for receiving goods.

When employees are ready to start reshelving items, they open up the plentymarkets app and tell it where the items are currently located. This way, the storage location from which items should be reshelved is specified.

Afterwards, the app lists all of the items that are currently at the selected storage location. Employees select the first item. Then, the storage location to which the item should be reshelved is selected in the app.

The plentymarkets app automatically switches back to the list of items waiting to be reshelved. Employees repeat this process until all items have been reshelved or the process is exited manually.

[#200]
== Carrying out one-time settings

Before you xref:app:reshelving.adoc#300[start reshelving], you’ll need to configure a few settings one time only in the plentymarkets app. These settings specify which storage locations your employees might want to reshelve and how items should be displayed in the app.

[.instruction]
Configuring the settings:

. xref:app:installation.adoc#1200[Log into the plentymarkets app].
. Tap on the *menu icon* (icon:bars[role="blue"]) in the top left corner.
. Tap on *Settings » Reshelving*. +
→ The settings for reshelving will open.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-settings-reshelving>>.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Focus on search field*
|Will you typically xref:app:reshelving.adoc#400[specify the source storage location] by scanning its barcode or by choosing the storage location from a list? If you want to scan the barcode, then this setting can speed up the job. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = The cursor will automatically start out in the barcode field when you reshelve items. You can scan the source storage location right away. +
*Deactivated* (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) = The cursor will not start out in the barcode field. Of course, it will still be possible to manually place the cursor in another field.

| *Storage location redistribution quantity*
|Will you typically xref:app:reshelving.adoc#600[reshelve] the entire item quantity?  If so, then this setting can speed up the job. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = The app will automatically suggest that you reshelve every copy of the item found at this storage location. Of course, you can still manually enter a different quantity if needed. +
*Deactivated* (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) = The quantity 1 will be suggested. You will have to enter the quantity manually.

| *Suggested source storage locations by purpose*
|Where are your items located before they are reshelved? Select the appropriate xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#200[warehouse] from the drop-down list. Use the toggle buttons to include or exclude specific xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#500[storage location purposes]. +
*_Example:_*Select the storage location purposes *Incoming stock* and *Return* if you want to reshelve goods that you’ve received from your supplier as well as returned items. +
*_Use case:_* During reshelving, the app will suggest storage locations that you might want to reshelve. You’ll only be suggested the source storage locations that meet these criteria. If you want to use a storage location that _was not suggested_, then you’ll have to scan the storage location rather than select it from the list of suggestions in the app.

| *Suggested target storage locations*
|Where do you want to put the items once they’ve been reshelved? Use the toggle buttons to include or exclude specific types of storage locations. +
*Suggested storage location* = Storage locations that are xref:stock-management:variations-track-stock.adoc#300[linked to a variation]. +
*Used storage locations* = Storage locations where variations are already stored. +
*Empty storage locations* = All available storage locations. +
*_Note:_* Depending on the number of storage locations, the setting *Empty storage locations* can significantly slow down the reshelving process. As such, we recommend that you link variations to storage locations and only activate empty storage locations if strictly necessary. +
*_Use case:_* During reshelving, the app will suggest storage locations that you might want to reshelve. You’ll only be suggested the source storage locations that meet these criteria. If you want to use a storage location that _was not suggested_, then you’ll have to scan the storage location rather than select it from the list of suggestions in the app.

| *Exclude target storage locations by purpose*
|Activate this option to prevent *Box* storage locations from being displayed on your list of suggestions. This can be a good idea if you also use the app for xref:app:mobile-box-picking.adoc#[box picking] and you don't want your boxes to get in the way when reshelving.

| *Template*
|What should your xref:app:reshelving.adoc#500[list of items] look like? The plentymarkets app comes with a default template, which is appropriate for most reshelving processes. However, you can create additional templates in the *Setup » plenty app » Rebooking*. Once you have created a template, you can select it from the drop-down list here. +
*_Tip:_* For example, templates let you control which information is displayed first, second, third, etc and which font size each piece of information should have.

== Reshelving items with the plentymarkets app

Once you’ve finished xref:app:reshelving.adoc#200[carrying out the one-time settings], you can begin using the plentymarkets app to quickly reshelve items.

[IMPORTANT]
.Are any items available?
====
Items can only be reshelved with the app if they’re at the correct storage location. If no items are currently at the selected storage location, then the app will not list any items to reshelve.
====

[#400]
=== Specifying the source storage location

Where are the items that need to be reshelved? Specify which storage location you want to reshelve.

[.instruction]
Specifying the source storage location:

. xref:app:installation.adoc#1200[Log into the plentymarkets app].
. Tap on the *menu icon* (icon:bars[role="blue"]) in the top left corner.
. Tap on *Warehouse management » Reshelving*. +
→ A list of all xref:app:reshelving.adoc#200[suggested storage locations] is displayed.
. Scan the storage location's barcode or tap on the storage location in the app. +
→ You will see a list of all items that are currently stored here.

[#500]
=== Selecting an item

plentymarkets automatically makes a list of all the items currently at this storage location. Duplicate items are grouped together. For example, if two copies of an item need to go back on the shelf, then the employee can specify the item quantity directly during reshelving.

The list includes important information about the items that are ready to be reshelved. For example, the employee sees the item ID and the item name. You can control which information is displayed on the list. To do so, create a xref:app:reshelving.adoc#200[template].

[.instruction]
Working with the item list:

. Look at the list to find out which items need to be reshelved.
. Decide which item you want to reshelve first.
. Scan the item's barcode or tap on the item in the app.

[#600]
=== Reshelving items

Where do you want to put these items once they’ve been reshelved? A list of all xref:app:reshelving.adoc#200[suggested storage locations] is displayed. Simply scan a storage location’s barcode or tap on a storage location in the app.

[.instruction]
Reshelving items:

. Put the item on the appropriate place on the shelf.
. Scan this storage location's barcode or tap on this storage location in the app. +
→ plentymarkets changes the item’s storage location. Your plentymarkets system keeps a record of this xref:stock-management:managing-stocks.adoc#1100[stock movement]. +
→ If other items still need to be reshelved from the source storage location, the screen will switch back to the xref:app:reshelving.adoc#500[item list] and you can continue with the next item.

[TIP]
.Multiple copies of an item
====
Duplicate items are grouped together in the app. For example, if two copies of an item need to go back on the shelf, then you can specify the item quantity while reshelving. Simply scan the item multiple times. Every time you scan the item, the number automatically increases by one. +
*_Note:_* Alternatively, tap on *Quantity* and enter the number.

If you typically reshelve the entire quantity, you can save time by activating the option *Storage location redistribution quantity* in the xref:app:reshelving.adoc#200[app settings].
