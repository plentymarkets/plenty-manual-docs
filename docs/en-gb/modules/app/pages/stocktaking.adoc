In addition to using the functionality in the <<stock-management/taking-stock#, plentymarkets back end>>, you can also take stock using the plentymarkets app. App users must be assigned the <<#300, right to take stock>>. In addition, <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#800, barcodes must be saved>> for the storage locations in your warehouse. You can activate the stocktaking mode to freeze stock during stocktaking. However, because the new stock data is saved to the variation automatically, activating the stocktacking mode is not mandatory.

[TIP]
.Hardware for the plentymarkets app
====
Check the <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-system-requirements#400, system requirements page>> of the manual to see current hardware recommendations for stocktaking using the plentymarkets app.

== Preparing app stocktaking

Carry out the settings described below to prepare stocktaking with the plentymarkets app.

[TIP]
.Labelling storage locations
====
To take stock with the plentymarkets app, you must assign barcodes to your storage locations. You can speed up the stocktaking process by <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#800, labelling your storage locations>>. During stocktaking, you can just scan the storage location's label.

=== Exporting stock with the data format Stock

If you want to check store discrepancies resulting from stocktaking at once, use the <<data/exporting-data/elastic-export#, elastic export>>. Before stocktaking, use the data format <<data/export-import/data-formats/stock, Stock>> to export your current stock. Export the data again after finishing the stocktaking process and compare the stock data.

== Stocktaking with the plentymarkets app

When taking stock with the plentymarkets app, you can either scan each piece of an item individually or enter the counted quantity using the keypad. The option *Scan items individually* determines how stocktaking is performed.

[IMPORTANT]
.Stock at a storage location is set to zero if not counted
====
Always count or scan all items present at a storage location. If you store different items at the same storage location, any stock of items that you do not count or scan during stocktaking will be set to zero. Example: +
The stock information for storage location 1 in plentymarkets is 10 x item A, 10 x item B and 2 x item C. During stocktaking, 10 x item A and 10 x item B is scanned. Item C is not scanned. +
→ The app books item A x 10, item B x 10 and item C x 0\. Thus, stock for item C is set to zero. +
If you only start creating further storage locations during stocktaking, these storage locations are not set to zero. This only applies to storage locations that are edited.

=== Scanning each piece of an item individually

Users do not have to count the stock. Instead, they can scan the labels of each piece of an item individually until they have scanned all pieces of an item present at the storage location.

. Scan the label of each piece until you have scanned all items present at the storage location. +
*_Tip:_* If the storage location contains more than one type of item, the quantity of the correct item is increased automatically during scanning. +
*_Note:_* To correct the scanned quantity manually, tap on the item and enter the correct quantity. +
→ If best before dates, batches or both are managed for the variation in the selected warehouse, you are asked to enter a date, a batch or both. +
*_Optional:_* Select the best before date and/or enter the batch and tap on *Add item*. +
→ The stock is booked in.
. To finish the count, scan the storage location label again or tap on *Save stock* if the button is shown. +
→ The counted quantity is saved. +
→ The counted stock is imported to the *Stock » Storage location management* menu of the plentymarkets back end. +
→ The stock information is saved in the *Item » Managing items* menu of the variation.
