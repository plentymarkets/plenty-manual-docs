== Using key figures in the plentymarkets app

Do you want to know how many orders have come in this month? Or how many new customers you have gained? In the plentymarkets app, you can display the most important key figures on the start page after logging in.

[#200]
=== Setting up a page

In the first step, you set up a so-called *page* to be displayed as the start page of the app. You need to set up at least one page to display key figures on it. 

[.instruction]
Setting up a page:

. <<app/installation#1100, Log in to the app>>.
. Tap on the pencil icon (icon:pencil[role="blue"]) in the top right corner and then on *Add new page*. +
→ The *New page* window is displayed.
. Enter a name for the page, for example *30-day overview*.

[#300]
=== Setting up the display of key figures

Proceed according to the following instructions to set up key figures. As an example, we show how to display the total number of orders available in your plentymarkets system.

[.instruction]
Setting up the display of key figures:

. Open the plentymarkets app.
. Tap on the pencil icon (icon:pencil[role="blue"]) in the top right corner and then on *Add new key figure*. +
→ The key figure menu opens.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Colour*
| Tap on *Choose colour* to determine the colour in which the key figure is displayed.

| *Time span*
| A period of 30 days is selected by default. If desired, select another period or the option *Date selection* to determine a fixed start and end date to limit the key figure.

| *Starting date* and *Ending date*
| If you have selected the option *Date selection* for the *Time span* setting, you can select a fixed start and end date here to limit the key figure.

| *From status* and *To status*
| Determine a status range so that only orders that are currently in the selected <<orders/managing-orders#1200, order statuses>> are considered for the key figure.

| *Client (store)*
| Select one or more <<online-store/setting-up-clients#, clients>> of your system whose orders are to be considered for the key figure.

| *Orders with outgoing items booked only*
| Activate this option to only consider orders for which <<stock-management/outgoing-items#, outgoing items>> have already been booked.

| *Order types*
| Select one or more <<orders/managing-orders#100, order types>> that are to be considered for the key figure.

| *Order referrer*
| Select one or more <<orders/order-referrer#, order referrers>> that are to be considered for the key figure.

[TIP]
.Further differentiation of order key figures
====
If, for example, you only want to show the returns available in your system as a separate key figure on the start page, set up a separate key figure and only select the order type *Return*. Use the settings **Name** and **Colour** to customise the display on the start page to allow for a better overview.
