== Using key figures in the plentymarkets app

Do you want to know how many orders have come in this month? Or how many new customers you have gained? In the plentymarkets app, you can display the most important key figures on the start page after logging in.

[#150]
=== Assigning rights

Decide which employees should work with key figures in the app and thus be authorised to view data. If users of the type *Admin* log into the app, they can create key figures and view statistics by default.
Users with *Back end* or *REST-API* accounts have to be assigned particular rights by an admin. This step is required so that those users can create key figures and view them after logging into the app.

[.instruction]
Assigning user rights for key figures:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts*.
. Open a user account with *Backend* or *REST-API* access rights.
. Click on the *Mobile* tab.
. Go to the *Visible key figures* area. +
→ The individual rights for the various key figures are displayed.
. Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the key figures that should be available for the user account.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

=== Setting up a page

In the first step, you set up a so-called *page* to be displayed as the start page of the app. You need to set up at least one page to display key figures on it.

. Tap on the pencil icon (icon:pencil[role="blue"]) in the top right corner and then on *Add new page*. +

| *Client (store)*
| Select one or more xref:online-store:setting-up-clients.adoc#[clients] of your system whose orders are to be considered for the key figure.

[TIP]
.Further differentiation of order key figures
====
If, for example, you only want to show the returns available in your system as a separate key figure on the start page, set up a separate key figure and only select the order type *Return*. Use the settings **Name** and **Colour** to customise the display on the start page to allow for a better overview.
====

[#400]

The following additional key figures can be set up and used in the plentymarkets app:
