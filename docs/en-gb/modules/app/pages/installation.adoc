Want your business to <<app#, profit from the plentymarkets app>>? Don’t lose any time! Start setting up the app on the appropriate hardware.

This page guides you through the installation process step-by-step and helps you complete the tasks that need to be done in advance. The settings described on this page go into effect when you begin <<app/functions#, using the app functions>>.

[#100]
== Choosing the right hardware

What do you want to use the app for? Which hardware you need depends on what you want to do with the app.

Do you want to see key performance indicators or track customer, item and order data? You only need a mobile Android or iOS device for these functions.

In addition, the plentymarkets app allows you to perform stock management tasks and to use the point of sale system plentyPOS. We recommend that you book a link:https://plentypos.plentymarkets.com/en/[hardware package^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] if you want to use these additional functions.

[#500]
== Downloading the app

include::_textblocks/hardware-requirements/download-links.adoc[]

[TIP]
.Is your company data safe on this device?
====
The plentymarkets app is safe in the sense that users can only <<app/installation#1200, log into the app with access data>>. But because the app can contain sensitive business data, we still recommend that you spend a few minutes thinking about security. Are your employees allowed to download the app on their own smartphones? Do your devices’ screens lock with a PIN or a password? Spend some time thinking about how your company will answer these sorts of questions.
====

[#600]
== Granting access to the app

The app will only work if you’ve link:https://www.plentymarkets.com//#[booked a plentymarkets ERP system^].{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. This means users will log in with the same access data they use for the booked plentymarkets system.

First, create access data for all employees who should use the plentymarkets app. Decide which app functions each employee should be allowed to use.

[#700]
=== Creating user accounts

Do all of your employees have a plentymarkets account? If not, log into your plentymarkets system and <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#10, create the necessary accounts>>.

Your employees will later <<app/installation#1200, log into the app>> with the user name and password you’ve created for them.

[TIP]
.Admin or back end account?
====
Admin users automatically have the right to access all plentymarkets functions without limitation. Think twice before you create admin accounts because they will also have the right to create, manage and edit other user accounts. +
If you want to choose which functions and menus a particular user is able to see, create a back end account.
====

[#800]
=== Defining rights

Should your employees be able to see all the functions in the app or just a few? Maybe your cashiers should have access to the mobile POS system but not to the inventory management functions.

In your plentymarkets system, you can decide which menus and key figures should be visible for each user account.

[.instruction]
Defining app rights:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts*.
. Open a *Backend* user account. +
*_Note:_* *Admin* users automatically have the right to access all functions. As such, it’s not possible to customise the rights for an admin.
. Click on the *Mobile* tab.
. Activate the functions and key figures that the user account should have access to in the app. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-app-rights>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

=== Assigning an app PIN

Will several employees share one device? Constantly logging in and out can quickly waste a lot of time. In such situations, we recommend having employees <<app/installation#1700, use a PIN to switch from one account to another>> instead of having them log in and out with their user name and password. If all of your users have their own PIN, they can quickly switch to a different user account in the plentymarkets app.

[.instruction]
Assigning an app PIN:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts*.
. Open a user account.
. Enter an app PIN for the user. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-app-pin>>.
. Re-enter the app PIN.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#1000]
=== Simultaneous use

Your link:https://www.plentymarkets.com/product/pricing/[plentymarkets edition^] specifies how many users can log into plentymarkets at the same time. This limit applies to your plentymarkets back end and to the plentymarkets app.

You can do the following if you reach the user limit:

* Ask users to log out manually.
* <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#170, Log out users in the session management menu>>.
* <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#190, Increase the user limit of your plentymarkets contract>>.

[TIP]
.How many accounts can I create?
====
We only limit simultaneous use and not the number of user accounts you can create.

[#1300]
=== Finding your way around the app

Have you logged into the plentymarkets app? Welcome! The start screen is the first menu you’ll see. Take a look at the header. Here you’ll see two important symbols:

* The pencil icon (icon:pencil[role="blue"]) in the top right corner. Tap on this symbol to set up <<app/functions/key-figures#, key performance indicators like revenue and sales figures>> on the start screen.

* The menu icon (icon:bars[role="blue"]) in the top left corner. Tap on this symbol to access the main menu. From here, you can view your <<app/functions/item-search#, item, customer and order data>>. You can use the app as an <<app/functions/warehouse-management#, inventory management system>>. Or you can <<pos#, ring up customers in your brick and mortar store>>.

Have you opened the main menu? Look at the header again. Now you’ll see two additional symbols in the top right corner:

* The cloud icon (icon:cloud[role="blue"]). This symbol shows whether you’re currently using the app in online or offline mode. If you want to use the app in offline mode, then you’ll also need the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentybaseitemcachepos_6313[plentyBase ItemCachePOS^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

* The user icon (icon:user[role="blue"]). This symbol shows who is currently logged in. Tap on this symbol to <<app/installation#1600, lock the screen>>, <<app/installation#1700, switch to a different user account>> or <<app/installation#1500, log out of the app altogether>>. +
This symbol displays the initials of whoever is currently logged in. It is whatever colour was chosen for this user account in the plentymarkets back end.

[TIP]
.Re-load the menu
====
Swipe down to refresh the screen.

== Logging out, locking the screen or switching the account

[#1500]
=== Logging out of the app

Proceed as follows to log out of the plentymarkets app.

[.instruction]
Logging out of the app:

. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="blue"]) in the top left corner of the app.
. Tap on *Logout*. +
→ The *Logout* window is displayed.

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Log current user back in automatically*
|Use the toggle button to tell plentymarkets whether you want to re-enter your access data the next time you log in. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = Next time the app is opened, the same user account is logged in automatically. No password is necessary to log in next time the app is started. +
*Deactivated* (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) = The user account is logged out completely and the login details are discarded. To log in again, the language, base URL and user details must be entered. +
*_Note:_* This setting is saved and applies to all users of the app.
|====

[TIP]
.Alternative approach
====
Alternatively, tap on the user icon icon:user[role="blue"] and then on the logout icon icon:sign-out[role="red"]. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-app-logout>>.
====

[#1600]
=== Locking and unlocking the screen

If you need to step away from the app for a moment, but you don’t want to log out altogether, then lock the screen so that no one can use the app without permission.

[.instruction]
Locking the screen:

. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="blue"]) in the top left corner of the app.
. Tap on the user icon (icon:user[role="blue"]) in the top right corner. +
→ You will see a list of people who have <<app/installation#900, an app PIN>>.
. Tap on the lock icon (icon:lock[role="blue"]) in the bottom left. +
→ Access to the app is locked. +
→ Your name is shown first in the list of users.

[.instruction]
Unlocking the screen again:

. Tap your user account.
. Enter your PIN or your password. +
→ Access to the app is unlocked. +
*_Tip:_* You can change to a different user account even if access to the app is locked. Tap a different user account in the list to change users.

[#1700]
=== Switching to a different user account

Are several employees sharing one device? Constantly logging in and out can quickly waste a lot of time. Instead of having users log out, it will be faster if they use a PIN to switch from one account to another.

[.instruction]
Switching to a different user account:

. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="blue"]) in the top left corner of the app.
. Tap on the user icon (icon:user[role="blue"]) in the top right corner. +
→ You will see a list of people who have <<app/installation#900, an app PIN>>. +
. Tap on the desired user account.
. When users log into the app for the first time, they need to enter the password. From the second login, the PIN has to be entered. +
→ The user account is switched.

Once you switch users, the same area of the app opens. If the new user does not have rights for this area of the app, the main menu of the app opens instead.

[TIP]
.Order details are saved
====
If you switch user accounts while ringing up a customer, the newly logged in user will see the transaction that was started. This way, new users can finish the transaction that was started.
====

[#1800]
== Customising the app

[#1900]
=== Working with templates

Do you want to control, e.g. which information is displayed first, second, third, etc and which font size is used to display information in the app?

//Link zur Seite "mobilen Picklisten" einbauen, sobald die Seite steht.
You can create templates for several different app functions. For example, you can decide how your <<app/functions/item-search#, item and order data>> should be displayed in the app or what your mobile pick lists should look like.

[#1910]
==== Creating a new template

[.instruction]
Creating a new template:

. Log into the plentymarkets back end.
. Go to *Setup » plenty app*.
. Click on whichever app function you want to create a template for.
. Click on *New template* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The *New template* window opens.
. Enter a name for the template.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The template is created and opened for editing.

[#1920]
==== Filling the template with information

Scroll up and down through <<app/installation#1900, the newly created template>>. Do you see both of the headings? Each heading corresponds to a different view. For example, one area might control how information is displayed in a list of search results. And the other area might control the detailed view.

[.instruction]
Filling the template with information:

. Expand the settings (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]) for each piece of information that should appear on the template.
. Decide what this information should look like and where it should appear. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-template-information>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

| *Line*
|Which row should the information be displayed in? Select a row number from the drop-down list. The smaller the number, the higher up this piece of information will be displayed. +
*Do not display* = This piece of information will not be included in the template.

| *Row priority*
|Have you put several different pieces of information in the same *Row*? If so, then decide which one should be displayed first, second, third, etc. +
In other words, first the *Row* option is taken into consideration. Then the *Row priority* option is considered.

| *Column*
|Should this information be displayed on the left, the right or should it take up the whole width of the screen?

| *Font*
|

[cols="1,3"]

[TIP]
.Additional options in the template
====
You’ll see additional options when you expand some pieces of information. For example, if you expand the item price, then you’ll be able to select the appropriate sales price from a drop-down list. Keep an eye out for the following additional options:

* *Item price » Price selection* = Select the sales price from the drop-down list.
* *Barcode » Barcode selection* = Select the barcode type from the drop-down list.
* *Item image » Image size* = Select a size for displaying the item image.

== Connecting the app to plentyBase

plentyBase is a tool that enables your local computer to communicate with plentymarkets.
In other words, plentyBase establishes an interface that allows you to use the printers that are connected to the computer in the plentymarkets back end and/or the plentymarkets app.

For example, you need to connect the app to plentyBase if you want to:

* <<app/functions/item-search#400, Print item labels with the plentymarkets app>>
* <<pos/integrating-plentymarkets-pos#1000, Print receipts with your local printer instead of with a special receipt printer>>
* link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentybaseitemcachepos_6313[Continue ringing up customers with plentyPOS even if your Internet connection is lost^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]
* link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentybasecustomerdisplaypos_6359[Show your customers information about the POS transaction on a monitor^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]

[TIP]
.Receipt printer does not require plentyBase
====
The receipt printer is connected to the plentymarkets app via the printer’s IP address. As such, you do not need plentyBase to operate the receipt printer. This means that you only need plentyBase if you want to use other printers with plentyPOS.
====

[.instruction]
Connecting the app to plentyBase:

. Download the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentybase_5053[installation files for plentyBase^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] onto your computer.
. Install plentyBase onto your computer. Carry out the settings as described in the <<automation/processes/installing-plentybase#, plentyBase documentation>>. +
*_Tip:_* Since you want to connect plentyBase to the app, select the option *HTTP server*. +
*_Tip:_* Write down the HTTP port. You will need this information again shortly.
. Start plentyBase on your computer.
. <<app/installation#1100, Log into the plentymarkets app>>.
. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="blue"]) in the top left corner of the app.
. Tap on *Settings » plentyBase*.
. Configure the settings as described in the <<automation/processes/installing-plentybase#, plentyBase documentation>>.
. Tap on the check mark (icon:check[role="blue"]) in the upper right corner to confirm the change.

== Updating the app

Are you looking forward to an upcoming feature? We’re happy to keep you in the loop about changes to the software! Each version of the app gets its own version number. You can see a record of changes in our changelog. link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/c/changelog/changelog-app[Subscribe to the changelog^] and always stay up to date.

//Wie kommen updates rein? Automatisch über den Play-Store oder muss der Händler aktiv etwas machen?

[#2150]
== Uninstalling the app

If your internet connection is down, POS orders are saved on your device and uploaded to plentymarkets once connection returns. If you uninstall the app on your device before all orders were uploaded to plentymarkets, the orders saved on your device are deleted permanently and cannot be recovered by you or the plentymarkets support team. As such, check that no offline orders exist on the device before you uninstall the app.
