You can enter a 4 to 12 digit PIN for employees who work with the plentymarkets app. If you save a PIN, it will be possible to quickly switch from one user account to another in the plentymarkets app. However, users can also log into the plentymarkets app with their password. +
*_Tip:_* Once the PIN has been saved, this field will contain 4 dots. These dots show that an app PIN has been saved for the user account. The actual PIN might consist of more numbers. +
When switching from one user account to another, it will be possible to select any user account that has a PIN. To remove the PIN, for example because the user no longer works with the app, delete the 4 dots and save the user account. +
