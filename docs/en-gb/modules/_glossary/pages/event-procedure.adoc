[#event-procedure]
Event procedure:: Event procedures are a tool to automatise different parts of order processing. With an event procedure, an event triggers a procedure: _If x happens, y is triggered_. One example of a frequently used event procedure is sending an order confirmation via email as soon as a new order has been created or placed by customers via the online store. The procedures that are triggered can be specified by using filters within the event procedure. +
