[#price-calculation]
Price calculation:: Price calculations allow you to calculate and update the <<#price, prices>> of variations automatically based on specific criteria. Users can add several costs saved for a variation to a sales price, e.g. transportation costs, storage costs, customs, VAT. Furthermore, users can add individual amounts to the price or subtract them from the price, e.g. plus 5% or multiplied by 1,05. +
