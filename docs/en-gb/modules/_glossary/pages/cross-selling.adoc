[#cross-selling]
Cross-selling:: In cross-selling, customers are subtly encouraged to spend more money.
This is done by offering additional products that relate to the purchased product.
Example: the sales person in an electronics store suggests a memory card that would work with the digital camera.
In e-commerce, customers can't directly be asked if they want to buy additional products.
Instead, a list of related items is displayed on the product page of the webshop.
