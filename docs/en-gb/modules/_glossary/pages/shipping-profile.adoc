[#shipping-profile]
Shipping profile:: Contains shipping combinations which customers can either select in the checkout or which are already assigned automatically to specific order types. For example, payment methods or customer classes can be deleted or extra charges for islands saved in the shipping profile. Those extra charges apply whenever a delivery to an island, e.g. Helgoland, is made. This means that additionally to the shipping costs a surcharge is due. +
