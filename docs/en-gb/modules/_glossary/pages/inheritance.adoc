[#inheritance]
Inheritance:: The <<#main-variation, main variation>> of an item differs from the child variations: The main variation can pass data on, i.e. other variations can _inherit_ its data. As such, the main variation is a parent variation that passes on certain settings to its children. By default, this inheritance function is active. When a new variation is created for an item, this variation inherits the inheritable settings of the main variation by default if no other data is saved. +
