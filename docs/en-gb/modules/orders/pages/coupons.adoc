Coupons are a great way to simultaneously attract new customers, increase loyalty and generate revenue. plentymarkets has a comprehensive coupon module in the *Orders » Coupons* menu. In this menu, you can create campaigns with various possibilities for discount. Coupons all have codes which belong to a campaign and which can either be redeemed once or multiple times. Coupons are redeemed during the order process. The corresponding discount value is displayed at this time.

[#possible-uses-coupons]
== Possible uses for coupons

A coupon has a code which belongs to a campaign and which can either be redeemed once or multiple times. Coupons are redeemed during the order process. The discount value is displayed at this time. Coupons can be sent to customers as promotional coupon codes within emails or multipurpose coupons can be sold as items in your online shop. The customer then receives the coupon code as a PDF document.

The following overview shows various possibilities for using coupons:

[TIP]
.Template variables for displaying voucher codes in email templates
====
When you insert the template variable `$ItemVoucherCodes` in the email template, the codes of a voucher are displayed per order item. The codes are separated by commas. Use the template variable `$VoucherCodes` to display all codes of all vouchers of an order. The codes are separated by commas.
====

[#prepare-items-for-purchase-coupons]
== Preparing items for purchase with coupons

Before you begin working with coupons, decide which of your items should be purchasable with a coupon.

[.instruction]
Preparing items for purchase with coupons:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item that should be purchasable with a coupon.
. Click on the <<item/managing-items#40, Global>> tab.
. Select the setting *Possible* from the drop-down list *Promotional coupon/POS discount*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.  +
→ It is possible for the customer to purchase this item with a coupon.

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not permit to purchase item with a coupon
====
Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]* and click on the *Global* tab. Set the *Promotional coupon* option to *Not permitted* if you want to prevent the item from being paid with a coupon. If the customer places such an item in the shopping cart, the coupon’s value is not applied to this item. It makes sense to prevent some items from being paid for with a coupon, e.g. special offers or other items that should not be discounted further.

If you want to make an item available for purchase with a coupon only, select the *Purchasable with coupon only* setting.
====

[#create-campaign]
== Creating a campaign

Because each coupon belongs to a campaign, you have to create a campaign first. Go to *Orders » Coupons* to create a campaign. Once you have created a campaign, 2 other tabs are displayed apart from the *Settings* tab: <<orders/coupons#generate-coupon-codes, Codes>> and <<orders/coupons#set-up-coupon-template, Templates>>.

[[image-create-campaign]]

*One redemption per customer* = The coupon can only be redeemed once per customer. +

By clicking on *Generate PDF*, the PDF file is generated and the customer can print or save the coupon.

[#coupon-as-pdf-attachment]
=== Automatically sending coupons as PDF attachments

It is useful to send coupons as PDF attachments, e.g. if you offer multipurpose coupons or travel vouchers in your online shop.

If you sell coupons that you do not want to provide as PDF attachments in the My account area, but would rather send via email, use an event procedure to generate and send the coupons. For the email despatch, you need an <<crm/sending-emails#1200, email template>>. In the email template, select the type *Voucher* for the option *PDF attachment*. The coupon is automatically attached to the email template as a PDF attachment.

[TIP]
