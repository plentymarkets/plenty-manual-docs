On this page of the manual, you find detailed information about how to use the package content list in plentymarkets. The package content list informs you about the content of pallets, packages and items. Such a list is relevant for a fulfilment service provider who stores and sends your items for you. The list informs them about which items are in the packages.

[TIP]
.Notes about the package content list
====
The available functions in the *Orders » Package content list* menu are primarily addressed to employees packing the items in the warehouse. Warehouse employees do not sit directly in front of the computer all the time, but rather move freely when using the barcode scanner and when packing the items,. This is why we intentionally designed the buttons and frames in this menu spaciously.
