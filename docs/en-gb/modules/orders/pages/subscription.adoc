:description: Learn how to create and work with subscriptions in plentymarkets.
:id: EFRPGV6
:author: team-order-core

Use the subscription module to generate orders that are automatically sent to your customers at preferred intervals you chose. By using the subscription, you do not have to create each order separately because the selected items are automatically and regularly sent to your customers.
Thus, you can create individual subscriptions for customers and configure the settings as required. +
You can conveniently create and edit subscriptions in an own menu in your plentymarkets system.
Orders generated through subscriptions are editable in the order overview, just like other orders. In the following chapters, we explain how you xref:orders:subscription.adoc#200[create a subscription], how you xref:orders:subscription.adoc#300[set up and edit a subscription] and which other options and functions are available to you.

[#100]
== Preparatory settings

You should take note of and decide on some preparatory settings. Having set those, you can work with subscriptions more conveniently. On the one hand, you can select xref:orders:subscription.adoc#110[default settings] for subscriptions, so that these settings are preselected when you are creating a new subscription and do not have to be carried out every time. Deciding on those settings beforehand saves time when you create new subscriptions. n the other hand, you have to assign xref:orders:subscription.adoc#120[user rights] if users of the type back end are to work with subscriptions as well. The default settings as well as the settings for assigning the required user rights are described in the following two chapters.

Moreover, tables are customisable. This means that you can decide which information is displayed in the table columns. To do so, proceed as follows:

[.instruction]
Customising tables:

. Click on *Configure columns* (material:settings[]). +
→ The window *Configure columns* opens.
. Select which columns are to be displayed.
. Move (material:sort[]) the columns so they are displayed in the order you need them in.
. Click on *Confirm* to save your settings.

When you have adapted a table, these settings are saved. The table remains editable, you can change it any time.

[#110]
=== Determining default settings

Go to the menu *Setup » Orders » Order types » Subscription* to decide on default settings for your subscriptions.
Settings chosen here are preselected for your new subscriptions and can accelerate your workflow if you regularly need the same settings for subscriptions.
 However, it is still possible to decide on different settings when creating a new subscription.

[.instruction]
Proceed as follows to carry out the default settings:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Subscription*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-subscription-default-settings>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

|Select whether orders are automatically generated for subscriptions when they are due.
These orders are then integrated in the order overview and can be edited there. +
*_Note_* that orders are _not_ generated automatically and have to be triggered manually when you do not activate this option.

|[#intable-subscription-default-status]*Default status*
|Select a default status for subscriptions. This status is then preselected for new subscriptions, but can still be adjusted if required. Available are all xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1220[statuses] you have created in your plentymarkets system.

|[#intable-subscription-default-interval]*Default interval*
|You can optionally set a default time period at which the items of a subscription are shipped regularly. This interval is then preselected for new subscriptions, but can still be adjusted if required.

|[#intable-subscription-default-owner]*Default owner*
|Select a default owner. Make sure that the allocated owner has the required xref:orders:subscription.adoc#120[user rights] for subscriptions.

|[#intable-subscription-default-referrer]*Default referrer*
|Select a default referrer. This referrer is then preselected for new subscriptions.

|[#intable-subscription-default-client]*Default client*
|Select a default client. This client is then preselected for new subscriptions.

|*Display of added items in the shopping cart*

[.discrete]
==== Subscription run preview

The *Subscription run preview* is also available in the *Setup » Orders » Order types » Subscription* menu.
Click on the button *Subscription run preview* and a new window with an overview of all *Due subscriptions* opens. These are sorted in ascending order by order IDs.
Additionally, the duration of the subscriptions as well as the last and the next run are displayed.

The information which subscriptions are due is retrieved once a day by the system.
The *Subscription run preview* does not only offer you an overview and the option to review due subscriptions, you can also trigger due subscriptions immediately. When doing this, take into account that _all due subscriptions are triggered at once_. A selection of individual subscriptions is not possible in this overview.
How you can trigger manual runs for individual subscriptions in the detail view of each subscription is explained further below in the chapter xref:orders:subscription.adoc#800[Fulfilled orders: Runs].

So, when due subscriptions are displayed, click on *Subscription run preview* in the lower right hand corner of the overview to trigger an immediate manual run. Wait a moment after clicking on the button.
The message *Run executed* is displayed after completion. You can see the orders generated by this in the *Order overview* as well as in the section xref:orders:subscription.adoc#800[Fulfilled orders] of the detail overview of the corresponding subscription.

[IMPORTANT]

[#subscription-myview]
== Using MyView

The user interface of the detail view of subscriptions is available as MyView. This means that users can create their own views with the available elements. This way, everyone can individually determine which information are needed where. Because of this customisation, working with subscriptions is not only more comfortable but also faster. This chapter explains how to work with MyView and how to create your own views. How to work with subscriptions, such as e.g. xref:orders:subscription.adoc#400[adding order items] or xref:orders:subscription.adoc#600[editing shipping method and costs] is explained in the following chapters.

You can access the detail view of a subscription from the overview table in the *Orders » Subscription [Test phase]* menu. Click on the row of the subscription you want to work with and the detail view of this subscription opens. +
If you haven’t yet created an own view, the *Default view* is displayed. You can use this default view when you are working with subscriptions or you can create your own view. The views you create are saved and can then be selected together with the default view from the list of views (icon:caret-down[role="darkGrey"]). Thus, you can switch between different views, if needed. The view selected last is always applied when opening a subscription.

=== Cart: Order item properties

You can edit the order item properties of a subscription in the shopping cart. Any changes made here only apply to the subscription in which they are edited. The properties themselves stay as they are configured in the system. Only the properties already created and configured in the system are available in the subscription. +
If you want to create and edit properties or are not yet familiar with the structure of properties, refer to the manual chapter xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Properties] first.

In order to link a property with an order item, the property has to be marked as *Order property* in the *Options* area of the property settings. Also set possible surcharges and VAT rates for the property in the xref:item:properties.adoc#property-options[options area]. The values added here will be included on the calculations.

If a property is already linked with an order item, it will be displayed on the corresponding order item. The properties are displayed in a second row of the table underneath the corresponding order item. By clicking on material:expand_more[], the second table row is displayed. There, you can find information about the *Name*, *Value* and *Surcharge* of the property. You can also delete (material:delete[]) order item properties in the table. Deleted properties are not included in this subscription and the calculations. +
To edit the properties or to add more already existing properties, click on *Edit properties* (material:edit[]). The editing window *Edit properties of [selected order item with ID]* opens and you can make further adaptations.
The following information about order item properties can be found in the editing window:

* *Name* = The name of the property is displayed. A red asterisk marks the property as a *required* property. Whether a property is required is determined in the xref:item:properties.adoc#property-options[Options] area of the property settings. Select *Required* from the *Order options* drop-down list.
* *Value* = The value of the property is displayed. The value is editable. Depending on the property type, you can either make a selection, edit the value, add a value or upload a file. The changes are only valid for this subscription.
* *Surcharge* = The surcharge of the property is displayed, if a surcharge is set for the property. The surcharge is editable. The changes are only valid for this subscription.

Moreover, some further editing options are available to you here. By clicking on *Delete* (material:delete[]), you remove the property from this order item. This property is then not included in the subscription and the order calculations +
You can also add more already existing properties. Select a property from the drop-down list *Select property* and add it to this order item by clicking on *Add property* (material:add[]). +
When you are done with all adaptations, click on *Save properties*. By clicking on *Cancel*, none of the changes are saved. he editing window is closed and you can edit the properties of other order items in the same way.

If you want to have the properties displayed on documents, you have to set this in the configurations of the property itself. Make sure that in the xref:item:properties.adoc#property-visibilities[visibilities] area of each property the option

* *Display on documents* from the *Display everywhere* drop-down list as well as
* the correct clients from the drop-down list *Clients* are selected.

Where on the document the properties are displayed depends on each property and its configurations. Properties for which no VAT rate was set in the *Options* area of the configuration or for which the option *Display as additional costs* in the *Order property* drop-down list was selected are displayed underneath the totals. Other properties are displayed in the order item table.

Save (material:save[]) the shopping cart when you are done with editing the order item properties and the shopping cart. After saving, you are redirected to the detail view of the subscription.

[#500]
=== Editing the item list

You can still edit the item list after the creation of the subscription. This is possible until the first order is generated by a run. After this, the editing options of the subscription are restricted. It is possible to <<#850, unlock>> the subscription. The item list can be edited after unlocking.

== Further areas in the detail view

The detail view of a subscription also offers you the further areas <<#800, Fulfilled orders>>, xref:orders:subscription.adoc#900[Messenger] as well as the xref:orders:subscription.adoc#1000[History]. Access these areas either via the navigation on the left or in the detail view. Decide how the elements are structured in the detail view by using xref:orders:subscription.adoc#subscription-myview[MyView].

Moreover, the detail view of a subscription provides info boxes with basic information about the subscription:

* Net order value: The net order value of the ordered items is displayed. Grey means that the value is zero. Green means that the value is above zero.
* Gross order value: The gross order value of the ordered items is displayed. Grey means that the value is zero. Green means that the value is above zero.
* Last run: The date of the last executed run is displayed. If no date is displayed, no run has yet been executed.

[#800]
=== Fulfilled orders: Runs

In this area, already fulfilled orders belonging to a subscription are displayed. These orders can be generated by either manual or automatic runs.
*Automatic runs* are regularly carried out at the intervals you selected for the subscription. When the subscription has reached the end date or when it is cancelled, no automatic runs are carried out any more.

Additionally to the automatic runs you can trigger a *manual run* (material:subscriptions[]). *_Note_* that a manual run is always carried out _immediately_. To trigger a manual run, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Triggering a manual run:

. Go to *Fulfilled orders* in the detail view of the subscription for which you want to trigger the manual run.
. Click on *Start manual run* (material:subscriptions[]).
. You are asked whether you want to skip the next automatic run. +
→ When the next automatic run is executed depends on the selected interval.
. The manual run is executed. +
→ The order generated by this is assigned an *order ID* and is displayed in the section *Fulfilled orders* as well as in the *order overview*.

Other information displayed in the section *Fulfilled orders* are for example the date of the order generation or the selected payment method.
Moreover, you can also delete (icon:minus-circle[]) individual orders of a subscription. When you delete an order here, it will also be deleted from the order overview in the *Edit orders* menu. *_Note_* that orders cannot be deleted when tax relevant documents, e.g. invoices, have already been generated.

[WARNING]
.Skipping an automatic run
====
When you chose *Skip the next automatic run* while triggering a manual run, the next automatic run is also skipped when the order generated by the manual run is deleted.

[.instruction]
Customising the table:

. Click on *Configure columns* (material:settings[]). +

==== Locking and unlocking of subscriptions

After the first order is generated, the subscription is locked and the editing options in the detail view are restricted. Still editable are the end date as well as the date the subscription is cancelled. If the order is deleted, the subscription is unlocked. But note that as soon as tax relevant documents, e.g. an invoice, exist, orders cannot be deleted any more.

Moreover, you can unlock the subscription by clicking in *Unlock subscription* (material:lock[]). All editing options are once more available then. It is documented in the xref:orders:subscription.adoc#1000[history] which user executed this step at and the time when it was done. The subscription is locked again by clicking on *Lock subscription* ((material:unlock[]). If this is not done the subscription will automatically be locked again after the next run es executed. But it is recommended to lock the subscription again after editing because this too is entered in the history. This way, transparency and traceability are ensured.
