In plentymarkets, you can generate entry certificates (German: Gelangensbestätigungen) as PDF files, for example if you want to print them or send them to your customers as an email attachment. +
An entry certificate is required with deliveries from Germany into another EU country. Recipients confirm receipt of the incoming items in the respective EU country e.g. by signing the entry certificate and sending it back to the sender. +
Thus, an entry certificate is not only a document that accompanies export deliveries, but may also be a receipt relevant for taxes and accounting.

For further information and instructions on setting up the document template, refer to the <<orders/order-documents#, Order documents>> page of the manual.
