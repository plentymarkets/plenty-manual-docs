:description: Learn how to generate packing lists as PDF files in order to get an overview of the orders and the respective order items. Moreover, find out how to display the desired item data.

In plentymarkets, you can generate packing lists as PDF files. +
A packing list includes an overview of all order items included in the order. In addition, the order ID is displayed in the form of a barcode. This barcode can be scanned and thus allows outgoing items to be booked directly after the shipping process has been initiated.

== Displaying item data

Use the options *Show* or *Do not show* in the menu *Setup » Orders » Documents » Packing list* to determine which item data should be displayed on your packing lists, such as *Item ID*, *Quantity* or *Item image*. +

You can carry out individual settings for most of the fields described in <<table-options-packing-list>> concerning the parameters width, font size and font weight that allow you to choose an individual layout of the packing list. Use the *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) to check the results of the settings while preparing the document template.

In plentymarkets, the following data is displayed by default on the packing list. Thus, it is not affected by the settings carried out in the menu *Setup » Orders » Documents » Packing list*:

* Customer name and address
* Order ID
* Order date
* Item name and quantity
* Shipping provider
* Payment method
