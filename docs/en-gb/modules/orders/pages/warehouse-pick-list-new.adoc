:description: With warehouse pick lists, you can display the relevant order items for a specific warehouse. Learn on this page how to generate warehouse pick lists with the desired item data as PDF files in order to improve the efficiency of the picking process.

In plentymarkets, you can generate warehouse pick lists as PDF files, for example if you want to print them or import them into another software. In contrast to the regular xref:orders:pick-list-new.adoc#[pick list], a warehouse pick list displays the relevant order items for a specific warehouse. If you use several warehouses, you can use the warehouse pick list to improve the efficiency of the picking process.

[#100]
== Displaying item data

Use the menu *Setup » Orders » Documents » Warehouse pick list* to determine which item data should be displayed on your warehouse pick lists, such as *Item ID*, *Quantity*, *Storage location* or *Invoice number*. In addition, you can determine at which positions and in which order those data are displayed on the warehouse pick list.

You can carry out individual settings for most of the fields described in <<table-orders-options-warehouse-pick-list>> concerning the parameters width, font size and font weight that allow you to choose an individual layout for the warehouse pick list. Use the *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) to check the results of the settings while preparing the document template.
To display the fields on the warehouse pick list in the order of your choice, assign the position numbers 1 to 14 from the respective drop-down list to them. Select the option *Pos* for fields that should not be displayed on the warehouse pick list.

[TIP]
.Mandatory setting
====
At least one of the fields *Order ID* or *Invoice number* has to be activated. This is done by assigning a *Position* to those fields on the warehouse pick list. Make sure to select a position number that is not already being used.

== Uploading a PDF template

A template is needed for displaying your online shop's letter paper, i.e. a page containing your company information, logo and layout elements according to your corporate design. This template needs to be in PDF format. In plentymarkets, it is possible to use a document template in PDF format to create the warehouse pick list. Proceed as described below to upload a PDF template.

[.instruction]
Uploading the PDF template:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Documents » Warehouse pick list*.
. Open the *PDF template* tab.
. Click on the *New template* tab.
. Click on *Choose file*.
. Select a PDF file as template.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The PDF template appears in the *Templates* tab. In this tab, you can preview or delete the PDF template.

If you use a PDF template including a header that you would like to position above the warehouse pick list, you might have to change the value saved as *top margin*.

== Changing a warehouse pick list

Use the menu *Orders » Fulfilment » Warehouse pick list* to generate a warehouse pick list and initiate automatic status changes. The warehouse pick list is generated as a PDF file.
Before generating a warehouse pick list, check the settings of the document template in the settings menu of the warehouse pick list.
The link *Change warehouse pick list* in the warehouse pick list menu takes you to the settings in the menu *Setup » Orders » Documents » xref:orders:warehouse-pick-list.adoc#[warehouse pick list]*, in which the document settings and the PDF template for the warehouse pick list are configured.
The following is an example of a warehouse pick list indicating the *order ID* and the *invoice number*. We recommend activating the *order ID* in all cases, since an invoice is not always available yet, as becomes clear in the example.
