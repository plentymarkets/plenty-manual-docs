This page of the manual describes how to set up and edit document templates and how to transfer settings from one template to another. +
Before generating order documents and sending them to your customers, you have to set up document templates for each document. <<orders/order-documents#100, Location-based documents>> as well as <<orders/order-documents#200, fulfilment documents>> are available in your plentymarkets system. In addition, learn how to save your business letterhead in the form of a PDF template and link it to a document template. The creation of numbering systems is explained as well.

[IMPORTANT]
.Orders with tax relevant documents

== Setting up the document template

Some settings are already available by default once you open one of the menus described above. You can edit those settings and carry out additional settings. If no settings are available by default, you can apply settings from a <<orders/order-documents#1600, default document template>> Furthermore, you can add notes that are automatically included in documents based on certain options and settings made. Separate templates have to be set up for each language. Select the language at the top of the document menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Defining a language per document template
====
If no document in the required language is found for a location, the system automatically searches for appropriate document templates in the following order: +
- Default language of the client +
- System language +
- Default location of the client +
- System language of the default location of the default client
====

[#400]
=== Basic settings

Carry out the basic settings for the document according to the information provided in <<table-documents-basic-settings>>.

[[table-documents-basic-settings]]
.Basic settings for documents
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Font*
|Select one of the standard fonts *Arial /Helvetica*, *Times New Roman* or *Courier*. +
Within the font group *Extended alphabets*, you can choose between the options *East Asian*, *Arabic*, *Cyrillic* or *Japanese* if you wish to set up document templates for <<data/internal-IDs#10, languages>> such as Chinese or Russian.

| *Character set*
|Select whether the character set *ISO-8859-1* or *Unicode* is to be used. Note that generating PDF documents takes longer if you select *Unicode*.

| *Document template*
|Select whether the document template is only displayed on the first page or on the subsequent pages of the document as well.

| *Page break*
|Select whether paragraphs should be continued on subsequent pages or whether there should be a page break.

| *Structure of the invoice/delivery address*
|Select the elements that should be included in the invoice and delivery address and in which order these elements should be positioned. +
Activate the option *Contact person* if the information on the contact person saved in the <<crm/managing-contacts#100, contact data>> should be included in invoice and delivery addresses. +
Activate the option *Title* if the title saved in the menu point *Addresses* in the contact data should be positioned in front of the contact name.

| *Currency of the document*
|Select whether the standard currency of your plentymarkets system or the *Order currency*, i.e. the currency saved with the order, is used.

|====

[TIP]
.Mandatory settings for characters
====
To set up document templates containing Chinese or Cyrillic characters, use the language setting on top of the menu to select the correct <<data/internal-IDs#10, language>>, for example *cn* for Chinese or *ru* for Russian, for which you would like to set up a document template. In addition, select the correct *Font* in the basic settings for the document. Select *East Asian* to display Chinese characters, or *Cyrillic* for Russian characters Furthermore, enter the correct characters in the text field for each option so that they are properly displayed when generating documents later.

[#500]
=== Margins

Carry out the settings for the page margins of the documents in this area. The margins are important for automatic page breaks and the positioning of mandatory elements in the document. Pay attention to the information provided in <<table-documents-margins>>.

[[table-documents-margins]]
.Margins of a document
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Top*
|Enter a value (in mm) for the top margin on the page. 44.0 mm are set by default. To avoid overlapping elements, make sure to leave enough space to display a header containing the logo of your company.

| *Left*
|Enter a value (in mm) for the left margin on the page. 20.0 mm are set by default.

| *Bottom*
|Enter a value (in mm) for the bottom margin on the page. 30.0 mm are set by default. For fulfilment documents, the bottom margin defined here is only displayed on pages linked to a PDF template. Depending on the settings made for the option *Document template* in the *Basic settings* area, this applies to either only the first or to all pages of a document.

|====

[#600]
=== Positioning the mandatory elements

Mandatory elements are elements that have to be included in every document. The positioning of mandatory elements is determined by entering coordinates. Values for the most important parameters are already set up by default. However, these values can be changed. Add any missing entries. +
<<table-documents-mandatory-elements>> explains the mandatory elements for documents, using the invoice document as an example.

The values are based on a coordinate system with an x-axis and a y-axis. The *X-axis* runs from left to right and the *Y-axis* from top to bottom. Thus, the zero point is located on the upper left corner of the page.

[TIP]
.Examples for positioning
====
The address field is a field that is usually positioned in the upper left area of the page. n the invoice document, the standard coordinates for the address field are X = 21 (mm), Y = 54.5 (mm).   When positioning fields, use the upper left corner of the document as a point of orientation and pay attention to the margins. +
In addition to the date, the order ID as well as the customer ID are fields that are typically positioned on the right. The IDs mentioned above have the following standard coordinates on the X-axis: X = 150 (mm) for the field name and X = 173 (mm) for the value.   The Y-coordinates differ so that fields and values do not overlap. +
The page number is a field that is often positioned on the bottom of the page. In the invoice document, the standard coordinates for the page number are X = 21 (mm), Y = 286 (mm).   Thus, the page number is located in the lower left corner of the page on invoice documents.

[#1800]
== Defining number ranges

Number ranges are available for numerous documents. You can manage the number ranges in the *Number range* within a document. The number range consists of up to 5 digits and may contain numbers, letters and characters. The number range is placed automatically in front of the actual number of the document.

Enter the first number in the field *Number (starting value)*. This number will be used as a starting value. This does not necessarily have to be “1”. For example, if you already have numbered invoices in your system, you can start from the existing values and continue the numbering. If you want the number to consist of a certain amount of digits, enter the starting value with leading zeros (e.g. 00001). If documents with higher numbers already exist in the system, these will be used.

Using the example of invoice documents, the following instruction describes how to define a number range. Proceed the same way for other documents.

[.instruction]
Defining a number range for invoices:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents » Invoice*.
. Select the required *Language* from the drop-down list.
. Open the tab *Number range*.
. Enter a prefix for the number range consisting of up to 5 numbers and/or letters in the field *Number range*, e.g. *2021* +
→ Add a hyphen at the end of the prefix to separate the prefix from the actual document number.
. Enter the first invoice number for the number range in the field *Number (starting value)*, e.g. *00001*. +
→ The invoice numbers are assigned starting from this number (in this example *202100001*).
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Several locations
====
If you wish to use number ranges for more than one location, you have the following options: +
*One number range for multiple locations* +
The numbers are counted upwards for all locations. Thus, each number is only assigned once. Select the same number range for every document and every location to use this method. +
*_Note:_* This method can only be used for locations belonging to the same client. It is not possible to assign a number range to multiple locations belonging to different clients. +
*Unique number ranges for each location* +
Specific number ranges can be defined per location and per document, e.g. by including an abbreviation for the location in the number range. The numbers are counted upwards within each number range. Thus, they can occur repeatedly within a client.
====

In addition, you can assign number ranges for individual countries. The document number is then assigned on the basis of the country indicated in the recipient’s address. Proceed as described below to assign number ranges for individual countries. Again, defining number ranges is explained using the example of invoices. However, keep in mind that creating individual number ranges per country does not always make sense. Contact your tax advisor before carrying out this setting.

[.instruction]
Defining a number range per country for invoices:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Documents » Invoice*.
. Select the required *Language* from the drop-down list.
. Open the tab *Number range*.
. Expand the menu *Numbering per country*.
. In the field *Numbering* for the individual countries, enter a Prefix consisting of up to 5 numbers and/or letters for the number range, e.g. *16DE* for Germany.
. In the field *Number (starting value)* for the individual countries, enter the number that should be assigned to the first invoice, e.g. *00001*. +
→ The invoice numbers are assigned for each country starting with this number.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[WARNING]
.Deleting or editing a number range
====
Do not remove a number range once you have started generating PDF documents that contain the number range. However, you can edit number ranges even when they are already in use. The changed number range has to differ from all other number ranges that are already in use. In other words, you have to change at least one digit or add a digit to an existing number range. However, you must not remove a digit. Example: If the previous number range was 13IN, 13I is not permitted as a new number range, but 13IN0 is.

== Automating subsequent procedures

After having set up the document templates, you can set up <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedures>> in the *Setup » Orders » Events* menu. One interesting possibility is automatically booking outgoing items as soon as an invoice is generated. You can also set up further procedures, such as automatically sending emails.

== Tax information for foreign shipments

In general, we recommend contacting your tax advisor to discuss all fiscally relevant contents in your document template before using them.

[#230]
=== EU delivery

For deliveries to countries belonging to the European Union and if a VAT number is available, the invoice is automatically created containing net prices. To comply with tax regulations, your own VAT number as well as the customer’s VAT number have to be displayed on the invoice. In addition, a note has to be displayed.

The customer’s VAT number is available as a data field in the *Positioning the mandatory fields* section. Position the customer’s VAT number in the upper section of the invoice by entering coordinates.

The data field *Tax note 1* is available in the *Optional elements below stock unit table* section. This data field is displayed with deliveries to the EU if the customer’s VAT number is available.

[TIP]
.Example: Sample note for Germany
====
“Export shipping according to $4 No. 1a in connection with $6 UStG.”

=== Export shipments

Export shipments are deliveries to a country outside the EU. Invoices for export shipments are also created with net prices. For this process, a note containing tax information has to be displayed as well. The data field *Tax note 2* is available for this. The required *tax notes* vary from case to case. Consult your tax advisor on the appropriate wording.

== Margin scheme for order items in documents

There are two settings for displaying order items and sums that are subject to the margin scheme on invoices, dunning letters and credit notes:

. Subtotal for order items to which the margin scheme applies
. Note on order items to which the margin scheme applies

For these settings to take effect and be displayed on documents, go to the *Setup » Client » Select client » Locations » Select location » Accounting » Tab: VAT rates* menu and select one of the 4 VAT rates for the option *Margin scheme* for the default country.
The margin scheme setting in plentymarkets is an older customised implementation. The tax rate will be applied to the entire amount of the order items that the margin scheme applies to. In other words, the tax rate will not be applied to the difference between sales price and purchase price.
