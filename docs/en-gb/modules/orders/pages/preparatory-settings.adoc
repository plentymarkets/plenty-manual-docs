= Carrying out the preparatory settings

:keywords: order settings, order basics
:author: team-order-core
:description: Learn which preparatory settings are required in order to work with orders. Moreover, find out how to transfer order information to another order by using the property transfer.

Before starting with managing and processing your orders, you should carry out certain basic settings. This page contains all relevant information on this topic.

Use the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu to determine which settings should automatically be set for orders and applied under certain conditions and statuses. For example, define the standard settings for the order referrer and the order status.


[#conditions]
== Important prerequisites

Standard values are selected by default in new systems. For example, status [9] for returns and status [11] for credit notes. These settings can be changed. To do so, select another status. Alternatively, go to *Setup » Orders » Order status* and create a new xref:orders:order-statuses.adoc#[order status]. Statuses created in this menu are displayed in the *Basic settings* menu and can be selected as default statuses.

[WARNING]
.User login
======
Whenever you carry out changes in this menu and save the settings, other users are logged out automatically and have to log in again. This ensures that the changes also apply to the other user profiles. Therefore, it is recommended that you announce changes to other users of your system in advance.

|Setting |Explanation

2+^| *Settings*

| [#intable-warehouse-assignment]*Warehouse assignment*
|Select the method according to which the warehouse is assigned. +
*a) a warehouse can be assigned for each order* (default setting) = Select this option if you only work with one warehouse or one logistics service provider. +
*b) a warehouse can be assigned for each stock unit* = Select this option of you work with multiple warehouses or multiple logistics service providers.

| [#intable-warehouse-selection]*Automatic warehouse selection*
|Choose the criterion according to which the warehouse should be selected. +
*a) depending on the delivery country* (default setting) = The warehouse that was saved for the *Country of delivery* in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Countries of delivery*. +
*_Tip:_* If you select this option, make sure to check which warehouse is assigned to the respective delivery countries. +
*b) depending on the item’s main warehouse* = The warehouse saved as the respective item’s main warehouse is selected. +
*_Note:_* If no main warehouse has been saved for an item, the warehouse is selected according to the country of delivery. +
*c) depending on the highest stock level* = The order is assigned to the warehouse with the highest stock for the order item. +
*c) depending on the warehouse priority and the highest stock level* = The order is assigned to a warehouse according to the following criteria. The following information is checked one after another: +
1) The *Priority* of the warehouse (option available in the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#300[warehouse settings]). +
In case of sufficient or identical stock in all warehouses, the warehouse with the highest priority. This first criterion does not consider the actual amount of stock. Rather, it checks whether enough stock is available or not. Thus, a warehouse is not favoured because it has more stock than another, but rather because it has a higher priority. Conversely, if a warehouse does not have sufficient stock, it will not be selected. +
2) Sufficient stock has to be available. +
*e) depending on the lowest stock level* = The order is assigned to the warehouse with the lowest stock level for the order item. +
*f) depending on the warehouse priority and the lowest stock level* = The order is assigned to a warehouse according to the following criteria. The following information is checked one after another: +
1) The *Priority* of the warehouse (option available in the warehouse settings). +
In case of sufficient or identical stock in all warehouses, the warehouse with the highest priority. This first criterion does not consider the actual amount of stock. Rather, it checks whether enough stock is available or not. Thus, a warehouse is not favoured because it has more stock than another, but rather because it has a higher priority. Conversely, if a warehouse does not have sufficient stock, it will not be selected. +
2) The warehouse with the lowest stock level is selected. +
*g) depending on the warehouse priority and the highest stock level (fallback: main warehouse)* = First, the settings regarding warehouse priority are checked for the warehouse assignment. The second criterion is the stock level, assignment is to the highest stock level. If no warehouse fulfils these criteria, which means that all stock levels are insufficient, the main warehouse of the variation is assigned to the order. +
*h) depending on the warehouse priority and the lowest stock level (fallback: main warehouse)* = First, the settings regarding warehouse priority are checked for the warehouse assignment. The second criterion is the stock level, assignment is to the lowest stock level. If no warehouse fulfils these criteria, which means that no warehouse has priority and stock levels are insufficient, the main warehouse of the variation is assigned to the order. +
*_Note:_* If no valid warehouse with exactly those settings can be found, the system will try to find the warehouse with the highest priority that is available for the order referrer. If no warehouse is available for the order referrer in question, the warehouse with the highest priority is picked.

| [#intable-default-status-cancelled-orders-from]*Status of cancelled orders from*
|Select the status range from which on orders should be cancelled. +
As soon as an order enters this status range, stock will no longer be reserved for the items included in the order. This means that the stock becomes available for other orders. Statuses can be excluded from this automatic function if necessary. For example, if you do not want items to be reversed if they have a particular status.

| [#intable-default-status-cancelled-orders-to]*Status of cancelled orders to*
|Select the status range up to which orders should be cancelled.

|[#intable-prefix-bundles]*Prefix for bundles*

Note that you need at least version 5.0.40 of plentyShop LTS/IO to use this setting.

| [#intable-default-referrer]*Default referrer*
|Select a provider, a market or the *Online store*. This referrer will automatically be set by default for all orders. Select *Manual entry* if you do not want to use a default setting, i.e. if you want to individually save each order referrer.

| [#intable-default-variation-id-dunning-fees]*Standard variation ID for dunning fees*
|Enter a default variation ID for dunning fees. This ID will automatically be preselected for dunning letters.

| [#intable-deposit-production-item]*Deposit payment on production items*
|Select a value (in percent) for the deposit or select the option *do not offer deposit*.

| [#intable-display-inactive-payment-plugins]*Show inactive payment methods*

|As soon as an order enters this status range, stock is automatically reserved for the items included in the order. You can also choose whether the setting should apply to all orders or to paid orders only. For example, select the option *Paid orders only* further below if stock should not be reserved for unpaid orders.

| [#intable-default-status-order-reservation]*Status for order reservations to*

| [#intable-order-reservation-paid-orders]*Order reservation for paid orders only*
|Activate this option if stock should only be reserved for paid orders.

| [#intable-status-change-missing-stock]*Status changes to [4] instead of [5] if stock is missing*
|Activate this option if an order should only be cleared for shipping when there is enough stock in the warehouse. As soon as enough stock has been booked into the warehouse, the xref:orders:order-statuses.adoc#[order status] is changed from *[4]* to *[5]*. This setting is active by default. +
*Status [4]* = In preparation for shipping +
*Status [5]* = Cleared for shipping

2+^| *Order UI*

 By clicking on the *Orders* main entry, you will also be directed to the *Orders » Orders (Test phase)* menu and links from other parts of your plentymarkets system will always lead you there. +
*Inactive* = The old Order UI in the *Orders » Edit orders* menu will be used for your work in the system (default setting). Note however that this menu will be shut down soon.

| [#intable-quantity-bundles]*Allow quantity change for bundle items and bundle components*
| *inactive* (default setting) = The quantities of bundle items and bundle components cannot be changed manually later in order processing. To adjust the quantity manually, the required bundle has to be added to the order again in the appropriate quantity. +
*active* = he quantities of bundle items and bundle components can be changed manually later in order processing. +
*_Note:_* Changing quantities manually after the order is created does not automatically cause an adaption of the quantities of the bundle components or an adaption of the prices.

[#transfer-property]
== Property transfer

In the property copy, you can determine which order information (properties of an order) are transferred to another order. For example, properties are copied when you create delivery orders or returns. Properties are information that are part of an order, e.g. the shipping profile, the payment status or the document language. Properties can belong to an order or to an order item. +
*_Note:_* This refers to xref:item:properties.adoc#500[properties] that you do not have created yourself, such as xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#95[order characteristics].

[IMPORTANT]
.Default for transferred properties
======
All required properties are transferred by default from one order type into another order type. Therefore, only make changes to the copied properties after careful consideration.
======

Use the menu *Setup » Orders » Property transfer* to determine which properties are to be copied. You determine this individually for different combinations, e.g. for the combination order (source) to delivery order (target). Note that not all of the properties are available for copying. The table column *Source* displays where a property comes from. *Internal* means that the property is a system property. *Interface* means that the property was created via a plugin or REST. +
When opening the menu, some filters are preset. Adapt these as described below if they don’t meet your requirements.

[.instruction]
Activating properties for transfer:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Transfer property*.
. Open the search filters (material:filter_alt[]).
. For the filter *Order type source*, select the order type from which the properties are to be transferred.
. For the filter *Order type target*, select the order type to which the properties are to be transferred.
. Carry out the search. +
→ The properties are displayed in the table.
. Activate or deactivate the properties you want to transfer in the column *Transfer order property*.
. Activate or deactivate the properties you want to transfer in the column *Transfer order item property*. +
→ The activated properties are transferred from now on.

In addition, the following filters are also available to you in the search (material:filter_alt[]):

* *Only display transferable properties* = Select *Yes* if only the properties that can be transferred from one order type to another are to be displayed in the table. Select *No* if all properties are to be displayed in the table, those that cannot be transferred as well.
* *Property ID* = Enter a distinct property ID for which you want to search. Only one ID can be entered at a time.
* *Source* = If you don’t select anything, the properties from all sources are displayed. If you select *Internal* or *Interface*, only the properties from the respective source are displayed.
