== Basic information about price calculation in plentysystems

The calculation of prices is based on the gross prices of variations. Based on this gross price, the net price of a variation is calculated for the order. To get the sums of the order items, the individual price of a variation is multiplied by the purchased quantity of the variation.  This means that the gross sum of an order item is calculated by multiplying the individual gross price of an item by the quantity. The net sum of an order item is calculated from the determined net price rounded to 4 or 2 decimal places, multiplied by the purchased quantity of an item. The number of decimal places of the single net price is defined by your accounting settings. To get the VAT amount for an order item, the net sum must be subtracted from the gross sum. +
Your settings determine when the price is rounded to 2 decimal places. Subsequent calculations are based on these rounded values. The settings in plentymarkets can lead to the following results:

* Rounded individual prices
* Rounded order item sums
* Rounded totals

[#150]
== Setting up how prices are saved and rounded

You carry out settings for saving and rounding prices in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting* menu. These settings are dependent on the client and the location. For the calculation of prices in orders, the settings configured at the time of order creation are applied. This means that adaptations to the settings for saving and rounding prices are not applied to already existing orders.

[.instruction]
Setting up how prices are saved and rounded:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting*. +
. In the *Basic settings* area, you can find the rounding setting under *Calculation method for order amounts*. 
. Carry out the settings according to the information provided in <<table-rounding-and-saving-prices>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-rounding-and-saving-prices]]
.Settings for saving and rounding prices
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| [#intable-prices-two-decimals-places]*Two decimals*
| The prices in an order are saved with only 2 decimal places. The indirect result of this setting is that the price of a single variation is rounded. The sums and totals of an order are then calculated based on the rounded individual prices of a variation. +

| [#intable-prices-four-decimals-places]*Four decimals*
|The prices in an order are saved with only 4 decimal places. Selecting 4 decimal places has the effect that the sum of an order item is rounded by default. However, in the background the sums are saved with 4 decimal places without rounding to ensure that it is still possible to only round the totals later.

| [#intable-two-decimals-rounding-prices]*Two decimals, round totals only*
|Activate this option if you want that only the totals of an order are rounded. The sums of order items are no longer rounded by default if this setting is active. Totals refer to the total value of an order. When you look at the settings of the document template for invoices the settings that are affected are the ones that are listed under the *sums* heading. +
However, if 2 decimal places are selected, this setting has no impact on the rounding of prices. +

| [#intable-four-decimals-rounding-prices]*Four decimals, round totals only*
|Activate this option if you want that only the totals of an order are rounded. The sums of order items are no longer rounded by default if this setting is active. Totals refer to the total value of an order. When you look at the settings of the document template for invoices the settings that are affected are the ones that are listed under the *sums* heading. +
If the option is not activated and 4 decimal places are selected, the sum of each order item is rounded. +

[#200]
=== Example calculations

The following section compares the different calculation methods and the results with the help of an example. +
In our example fabrics were sold. Several panels of the same fabric were bought, but with different widths. The widths are 50 cm and 30 cm. The 50 cm panel was bought 8 times and the 30 cm panel 7 times. 30 centimetres cost € 2.187 and 50 centimetres cost € 3.645. The prices are calculated based on a price of € 7.29 per metre. The settings that have be carried out to get one of the results are also listed in the table.

[#300]
== Carrying out VAT settings

The VAT settings are location-based. This means that you set different settings for each location. Locations are required for your registered business addresses or for countries that you ship from. There are two locations per default in your system. These locations are Germany and United Kingdom. However, for the productive mode of your system, you need your own locations. +
Your system differentiates between countries that are members of the European Union and non-EU countries. If you set up a location which is not within the EU, every delivery to another country is treated as export shipping. If your location is within the EU, it is differentiated between intra-community shipping and export shipping. +
The basic VAT relevant settings include settings that define how the system reacts for export shipping and how the VAT amount for shipping costs are displayed. For EU locations you can also define how the system reacts if a VAT ID is given in the order.

[WARNING]
.Do not use the example locations for real orders
====
The two locations Germany and United Kingdom are examples and are not meant for use in productive mode. It is best if you set up our own locations or at least edit the existing locations. When editing the existing locations you need to add at least a new VAT configuration with your correct VAT number and the correct VAT rates.
====

[#320]
=== Creating a new location

Proceed as described below to create a new location. Furthermore, you need to set one location as your xref:online-store:setting-up-clients.adoc#basic-settings[default location]. Your default location is your head office, so to speak.

[.instruction]
Creating a new location:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations*.
. Select the menu entry *New location*. +
→ An editing window will open.
. Enter the *Name* of the new location.
. Select the *Country* of the new location. You can only choose from countries that are already defined as delivery countries in the plentysystems.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The location is added to the list of locations.

Each location is divided into the following 3 submenus:

* Settings
* Accounting
* Documents

The submenu *Settings* contains the ID, the name and the country of the location. The Accounting submenu contains several areas. In the *Documents* submenu, you can find the old menu for setting up location-specific documents such as invoices and delivery notes. The xref:orders:document-builder.adoc#[DocumentBuilder] is now the main menu for document creation. Fur further information, refer to the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[Order documents] page of the manual.

[#330]
=== Deleting a location

You can only delete a location if another location exists. It is not possible to delete the xref:online-store:setting-up-clients.adoc#basic-settings[default location].

[.instruction]
Deleting a location:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations*.
. Open the submenu *Settings* of the location you want to delete.
. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-square[role="red"]). +
→ Confirm the security question to delete the location.

[#350]
=== Using the German small business owner regulation

If you are a small business owner in Germany and you do not want VAT to be applied to your invoices, then activating a setting in your basic settings is all you need to do. However, even though the VAT is not applied, you still need to save the correct VAT rates in your settings for a correctly functioning system. .

[TIP]
.Small business owner setting only for systems with Germany as system country
====
The *small business owner* setting is only available if your system was set up with *Germany* as system country. The system country is a setting that you cannot access and that is selected based on the information that you provide when you order a plentysystems.
====

[.instruction]
Using the German small business owner regulation:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting*. +
. In the *Basic settings* area, you can find the small business setting under *Business VAT management*.
. Activate the *VAT exemption for small businesses* option by selecting *Yes* .
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Displaying small business owner information on invoices
====
As a small business owner you need to place information on your invoice why no VAT has been applied.  You can use the note field on your invoice template for this information. The setting for small business owners does not automatically place a note on your invoice.
====

[#400]
=== Setting up how invoices are issued for deliveries within the EU

For deliveries within the EU, you can choose whether customers with a VAT number should receive a net invoice or a gross invoice. In many cases the information of the delivery’s recipient are of higher priority than the ones of the invoice’s recipient.  The delivery address has to be in another EU country if you want to issue a net invoice. For deliveries within the same member state of the EU the VAT is always applied regardless of the selected setting. To prevent this, you have to enclose an entry certificate in the delivery and have to select this option in the order within the delivery address. If the customer does not have a VAT number, this means that it is a private purchase and that VAT is applied anyway. The only time VAT is not applied for private purchases is if you are a small business owner as described above.

[.instruction]
Setting up gross or net invoices for deliveries within the EU:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting*. +
. In the *Basic settings* area, you can find the sales tax settings under *VAT Settings*.
. Select an option for the *Amounts in orders where a VAT ID is specified (intra-Community deliveries)*. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-intra-EU-invoices>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-intra-EU-invoices]]
.Issuing invoices for deliveries within the EU
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting|Explanation

| *Net*

Only applies to deliveries within the EU. +

| *Gross*
|All invoices for deliveries within the EU are issued as gross. +

|====

[#450]
==== Examples with the settings’ effect

In the following section, 6 possible setting combinations and the effects are described.

[.collapseBox]
.What is the result if the sender, the delivery’s recipient and the invoice recipient are in the same member state of the European Union and if the setting net invoice is selected?
--
In this case, the invoice is always provided as gross, even if the setting *Net* has been selected.
--

[.collapseBox]
.What is the result if the sender and the delivery’s recipient are in the same member state of the European Union, but the invoice recipient is in a different member state and if the setting net invoice is selected?
--
 In this case, the invoice is provided as gross, even if the setting *Net* has been selected. However, a net invoice is actually allowed if the invoice recipient has a VAT number. An additional setting has be carried out to issue a net invoice. The entry certificate must be activated in the delivery address data of the order. The invoice is gross as long as the entry certificate setting is not activate. The entry certificate is an individual delivery address setting.
--

[.collapseBox]
.What is the result if the sender and the invoice recipient are in the same member state of the European Union, but the delivery’s recipient is in a different member state and if the setting net invoice is selected?
--
The invoice is net if the recipient of the delivery has a VAT number. The invoice recipient does not play a role in this scenario.
--

[.collapseBox]
.What is the result if the sender is in one member state of the European Union, but the invoice recipient and the delivery’s recipient are in a different member state and if the setting net invoice is selected?
--
The invoice is net as soon as either the recipient of the delivery or the recipient of the invoice has a VAT number. The invoice is gross if neither the recipient of the delivery nor the recipient of the invoice has a VAT number.
--

[.collapseBox]
.What is the result if the sender is in one member state of the European Union, but the delivery’s recipient is in a different member state and the invoice recipient is in a country outside of the EU and if the setting net invoice is selected?
--
The invoice is net as soon as either the recipient of the delivery or the recipient of the invoice has a VAT number. The invoice is gross if neither the recipient of the delivery nor the recipient of the invoice has a VAT number.
--

[.collapseBox]
.What is the result if the sender is in one member state of the European Union, but the invoice recipient is in a different member state and the delivery’s recipient is in a country outside of the EU and if the setting net invoice is selected?
--
In this case the delivery is an export shipment and the setting for an *export shipping* is applied. The settings for export shippings are explained in the next section on this page.
--

[#500]
=== Issuing an invoice for export shipments

For each accounting location you can individually define whether the invoice for export shipments should be net or gross. The basic assumption is that your business is based in the European Union. The setting is applied if the delivery is sent to a country outside the European Union. If the invoice is a net invoice, your customers receive an invoice without VAT.

[.instruction]
Setting up gross or net invoices for export shipping:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting*. +
. In the *Basic settings* area, you can find the sales tax settings under *VAT Settings*.
. Select an option for *Amounts in orders for export deliveries (delivery from the EU to Non-EU countries)*. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-export-shipping-invoices>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-export-shipping-invoices]]
.Invoice settings for export shipping
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting|Explanation

| *Net*
|Invoices for export shipping are issued without VAT. +

| *Gross*
|Invoices for export shipping are issued with VAT. +
Which VAT rate is applied depends on whether a VAT rate was set up for the delivery country. If you have set up VAT rates for the country of delivery, then these VAT rates are applied. If no VAT rates are set up for the country of delivery, the VAT rates of the location are used.
|====

[#510]
=== Applying the Reverse charge procedure

The *Reverse charge procedure*, also known as the *Deduction procedure*, is a special sales tax regulation. If the procedure is applied, the recipients (= your customers) are liable for the VAT and not the merchant or company providing the service (= you as a merchant or your company). The reverse charge procedure is only applicable to B2B deliveries. If it is applied, it is necessary that

* the VAT ID of the customer is added in the order.
* a net invoice is issued for this customer.
* a note stating that the reverse charge procedure is applied is displayed on this net invoice.

This setting is dependent on location, which means that you can decide separately for each location if the procedure is to be applied. The Reverse charge procedure is *deactivated* by default, i.e. *No* is selected for every location. If you want to activate this option, go to the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting* menu. In the Basic settings area under *Business VAT management* » *Reverse charge procedure*, select the option *Yes*. Also consider the explanations in <<table-reverse-charge-procedure>>.

[[table-reverse-charge-procedure]]
.Reverse charge procedure
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting|Explanation

| *No (default)*
|The reverse charge mechanism isn’t applied. +

|*Yes*
|The reverse charge mechanism is applied. The prerequisite is that it is a B2B order and the customer’s VAT number is stated in the order. If you select Yes, the system automatically determines whether the requirements are met. The invoice will then be issued as a net invoice and the tax note that the reverse charge procedure is applied will be displayed on the invoice. +
*_Important_*: You need to save this tax note in your xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[document template for invoices] in advance.

|====

[#525]
=== Delivery threshold and OSS

From the 01/07/2021 on, there are no more different delivery thresholds within the EU. Instead, a common delivery threshold of *€ 10.000* for all B2C deliveries applies. +
If you sell to other EU countries and exceed this delivery threshold, you are liable for VAT in other countries. How much VAT you have to pay in which countries depends on the individual transactions. The settlement of VAT for B2C deliveries can be handled centrally via the One-Stop-Shop (OSS) procedure and is then no longer carried out individually for each EU country. The reporting period here is always per quarter and the payment period ends 30 days after the end of the reporting period. +
In Germany, the Federal Central Tax Office is responsible for the OSS procedure. You can also link:https://www.elster.de/bportal/start?locale=en_US[register for OSS]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] directly with them. You can find all information about OSS link:https://www.bzst.de/EN/Businesses/businesses_node.html;jsessionid=145464722DEC78A89CDA8E5E3A86E335.live831[here]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. Participating in the OSS is not compolsory. We recommend to discuss with your tac office whether participation makes sense for you.

To represent all this in plentysystems, you need to implement two things in particular:

* Set up <<#550, VAT rates>> for your delivery countries. This is not to be confused with creating a new <<#320, location>>. You can create VAT rates as described in the <<#550, following chapter>> or you can use the VAT rate assistant. +
Either way, it is very important that you make sure to enter the correct data. Otherwise, wrong VAT rates and incorrect configurations could be created which cannot be reversed.
* Enter and maintain <<#620, taric codes>>, as these are central for mapping the different taxation of items. Add the taric codes on the variations and then link these with the corresponding VAT rates of the individual EU countries in the taric code table.

In the forum post link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/stichtag-01-07-2021-faq-zu-eu-umsatzsteuer-harmonisierung-lieferschwellen-oss-co/642767[Deadline 01/07/2021: FAQ on EU VAT, harmonisation of delivery thresholds, OSS & Co] you will find further information and a combined thread with FAQs, which is constantly being expanded.

[#550]
=== Setting up VAT rates

In plentysystems, the disctinction between locations and delivery countries in which you are liable to pay tax is important. An accounting location is a registered business address. 2 accounting locations exist per default in plentysystems. The default locations are Germany and United Kingdom. You need one location at the very least and you can add further locations for each of your subsidiaries. The 2 default locations include default VAT configurations with VAT rates etc. However, do not use these configurations for the productive mode of your system. Add your own configurations and delete the default ones. You need to set up at least one configuration. +
You can use this configuration to ship worldwide. However, you need to add further configurations for your delivery countries within the EU as soon as you exceed the <<#525, delivery threshold>> for a EU country. You add locations for company headquarters and the country of the location with VAT configurations for correct accounting.

[TIP]
.Official tax information

_Note_ that the values entered here take precedence over those entered under *Revenue Accounts* for the determination of revenue accounts.

|====

[#600]
=== VAT for digital items

The buyer's VAT rate must be used for digital items. An EU regulation put these VAT rates into effect on 01/01/2015\. If a VAT rate is already available for a country of delivery it is not necessary to create an additional VAT rate for digital items only. The existing VAT rate is used. If no VAT rate is set up for one or more countries of delivery, then set up your accounting procedures in plentysystems as described below. +
The EU regulation applies to B2C revenues. B2B revenues without VAT are not affected

[.instruction]
Identifying the VAT for digital items:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting*. +
. In the Country-specific VAT rates area, you can find the country-specific sales tax settings and the setting for digital items.
. Click on *Add new entry* (material:add[]).
. Create a VAT configuration for every country of delivery where digital items are sold.
. Open the VAT configuration and activate the option *For digital items only*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The new configuration is displayed in the table together with all other existing configurations.

[#620]
== Taric codes

Taric codes, also called taric numbers, are used in EU-wide trading. These are unique and fixed numbers which are assigned to a specific commodity and have to be included in tax relevant documents.

Taric codes are relevant for you if you are trading EU-wide and have exceeded the <<#525, delivery threshold>> of 10.000 EUR for B2C sales. In this case you should enter the taric codes in good time. We recommend to clarify all details regarding the taxation of your goods in other EU countries with your tax consultant.

Goods are charged with different taxes in different EU countries. In order to take this into account and thus also have a correct basis for the calculation of orders, the taric codes have to be entered into the system and also checked against the VAT rates which are set for different countries.
Thus, as a first step, you have to maintain the taric codes in your system. The xref:item:managing-items.adoc#280[taric codes] are entered in the *variations* of an item. Moreover, you need to set <<#550, VAT rates>> for the required countries. These VAT rates can also be entered later, but we recommend setting these up in the system in time.

The table in the *Setup » Client » Setting » Taric code* menu then enables the linking of taric code, VAT rate and country. Thus, this taric code table is a basis for the calculation of orders and has to be maintained as well. It is important to note that no tax rates are directly entered here. Instead, you select the ID (A, B, C, etc.) of the tax rate of the corresponding tax rate configuration. Therefore, it is essential to be careful in the maintenance of the <<#550, VAT settings>>.

[.collapseBox]
.This happens in the background when orders are calculated*
--

Imagine that an order with the delivery country France enters the system. VAT rate A is set for the variation of the order item in the order. But in France, this item is taxed with the VAT rate B. That is why there is an entry in the taric code table with the same taric code as the one entered in the variation. The difference is that in the table, this taric code is linked with France and the VAT rate B. The order logic recognises these cases and uses the VAT rate set in the taric code table.

--

In case there is no taric code entered in the variation or in the table, no differing VAT rate is used for the calculation. This means that you only have to enter the corresponding taric codes in the table if a variation is _taxed differently_ in other countries.

You can use the import tool to import customs tariff numbers. You can also enter the numbers manually. We recommend to the import tool and to enter only single taric codes or carry out small adaptations manually.
_Note_ that only numbers up to 14 characters are allowed. Entering special or blank characters is not allowed.

The sync type xref:data:elasticSync-assignment-taric-code.adoc#[Assignment taric codes] is available for importing taric codes. You can find general information about imports via the import tool on the manual page xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc[Using the import tool].

To fill the table manually, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Filling the taric code table manually:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Settings » Taric codes*.
. Click on *New assignment* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ A new row is added to the table.
. Enter the *taric code*.
. Select the corresponding *country*.
. Select the corresponding *VAT rate*.
. Click on *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) at the end of the row. +
→ The changes are saved.

In the table, found variation links are marked with a green dot. This means that this taric code is currently in use in a variation. If a red dot is displayed, no variation link was found. This taric code is not in use in any variation

More editing options are available. For this, pay attention to the information given in the following table.

== Exporting accounting data

plentysystems allows you to export accounting data. You can use the export to transfer the data to your accounting software. When you export your accounting data the system automatically assigns debtor accounts, revenue accounts and posting keys according to the settings that you have set up prior to the export.

The *Data » Custom export* menu contains predefined export formats which can be used to export accounting data. The data fields that are exported are predefined for those export formats. Nevertheless, there are a few settings that you need to carry out. These settings have an effect on the export’s data volume.

Go to *Data » Data export* and select the data format that you want to export.

<<tabelle-vorkonfigurierte-exportformate>> explains the predefined data formats that are available in the *Data » Custom export* menu. Below the table you can find the steps that are required to export a predefined data format. The settings that require additional information are not listed for every data format, but summarised in <<tabelle-einstellungen-datenformat-exportieren>>.
