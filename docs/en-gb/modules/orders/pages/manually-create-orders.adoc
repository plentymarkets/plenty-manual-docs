:description: Learn how to manually create orders or offers in three steps. You can do this via cash sales, orders or contacts.

//adjust links to new pages where possible (auftragsdokumente once this has been moved)

This page describes how you can create orders in the system, e.g. if an order is placed during a phone call. In plentymarkets, the following methods are available for creating orders:

* Via a <<#create-order-via-cash-sale, cash sale>>
* Via <<#create-order-via-order, orders>>
* Via <<#create-order-via-contact, contacts>>

*_Tip:_* The approach for offers is identical. In the first step of the order creation, select the option *offer* in the *order type* setting to create an offer.

[IMPORTANT]
.Sending emails
====
When you manually create orders, no emails will automatically be sent to the customer. The reason that no emails will be sent is that your system does not know when you are done with all settings for a manual order. Send xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#[emails] manually by using the *Email service* function in an order.
====

[#create-order-via-cash-sale]
== Creating an order or an offer for a cash sale

When you open the *CRM » Contacts* menu you can register cash sales using the customer profile *Cash sale*. The customer profile named *Cash sale* allows you to assign orders without having to assign them to a customer. The customer profile *Cash sale* is set up in your system by default.

[WARNING]
.Payment method and order documents for cash sale
====
Make sure to select the correct *payment method* in the *order data* when creating an order for a cash sale. When manually creating a cash sale order the order will not be assigned to a customer saved in your system. This is why you should manually generate the required xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[order documents] such as the invoice right away while entering and processing the cash sale. Order documents can be generated in the *Documents* tab of the order.

[.instruction]
Creating an order or an offer via contacts:

. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the information about <<#create-order-or-offer, creating orders or offers>>.

[#carrying-out-standard-settings]
=== Carrying out default settings

When creating orders or offers via the contact overview, data such as addresses or clients are taken directly from the contact data if they are deposited there. Thus, in most cases contact data have priority. Additionally, some default settings, which are a fallback if the data are not deposited in the contact, are available. +
In order to optimise the order creation, these default settings should be determined first. +
*_Note:_* The default settings also apply to offers that are created via the contact UI.

[.instruction]
Carrying out default settings:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Sales order*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-default-settings-order-contact>>.
. *Save* (material:save[role=green]) the settings.

[#create-order-or-offer]
== Creating an order or an offer

No matter which of the described options you choose - the creation of a new order or offer is always carried out in three steps. In a first step, <<#step-one-basics, order details are entered>>, in the second step, <<#step-two-add-items, order items are added>> and in the third step, the <<#step-three-summary, order is completed>>. First of all, select the contact for which the order or offer is to be created.

Above the order details, you can also choose between an order or an offer afterwards. In addition, you can select an optional <<#create-and-apply-order-templates, order template>> from the drop-down list to apply the template to this order. By default, no order template is selected.

The steps described in the following chapters are the same for orders and offers.

The user interface is designed so that orders can be created quickly and easily. This is especially helpful when orders are telephoned in. First, the order details such as addresses and payment method are entered. After that, order items are added and the last step is the final check and completion of the order.

[#edit-order-item-properties]
=== Editing order item properties

You can edit the order item properties in the shopping cart. Any changes made here only apply to the order items of this order. The properties themselves stay as they are configured in the system. Only the properties that have already been created and configured in the system are available in the order creation. +
If you want to create and edit properties or are not yet familiar with the structure of properties, refer to the manual chapter xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Properties] first.

In order to link a property with an order item, the property has to be marked as *Order property* in the *Options* area of the property settings. Also set possible surcharges and VAT rates for the property in the xref:item:properties.adoc#property-options[Options] area. The values added here will be included in the order calculations. If a property is already linked with an order item, it will be displayed on the corresponding order item.

The properties are displayed in a second row of the table underneath the corresponding order item. Here, you can find information about the *Name*, *Value*, *Surcharge* and *VAT %* of the property. You can edit the *VAT %*, i.e. the saved VAT rate of the property, directly in the table if the property type allows for that. Moreover, you can *delete* (material:delete[]) order item properties in the table. Deleted properties are not included in this order and the calculations. +
To edit the properties or to add more already existing properties, click on *Edit properties* (material:edit[]) in the context menu (material:more_vert[]) on the right.

In the editing window, you will find the following information about an order item’s property:

* *Name* = The name of the property is displayed. A red asterisk marks the property as a required property. Whether a property is required is determined in the xref:item:properties.adoc#property-options[Options] area of the property settings. Select *Required* from the *Order options* drop-down list.
* *Value* = The value of the property is displayed. You can edit the value. Depending on the property type, you can either make a selection, edit the value, add a value or upload a file. The changes are only valid for this order.
* *Surcharge* = The surcharge of the property is displayed, if a surcharge is set for the property. You can edit the surcharge. The changes are only valid for this order.

There are also further editing options are available here. By clicking on *Delete* (material:delete[]), you remove the property from this order item. This property is then not included in the order and the order calculations. +
You can also add more already existing properties. Select a property from the drop-down list *Select property* and add it to the order item by clicking on *Add property* (material:add[]). +
Once you are done with all adaptations, click on *Save properties*. By clicking on *Cancel*, none of the changes are saved. he editing window is closed and you can edit the properties of other order items in the same way.

If you want to have the properties displayed on documents, you have to set this in the configurations of the property itself. Make sure that the following options are selected in the xref:item:properties.adoc#property-visibilities[Visibilities] area of each property:

* *Display on documents* from the *Display everywhere* drop-down list as well as
* the correct clients from the *Clients* drop-down list.

Where the properties are displayed on the document depends on each property and its configuration. Properties for which no VAT rate was set in the *Options* area of the configuration or for which the option *Display as additional costs* in the *Order property* drop-down list was selected are displayed underneath the totals. Other properties are displayed in the order item table.

When you are done with editing the order item properties and the shopping cart, the last step of the order creation follows. In this step, the order item properties are not displayed again. Thus, make sure that you carried out all relevant settings. Click on *Create order* or *Create offer*.

[#step-three-summary]
=== Step 3: Create order / Create offer

In the last step, the order or the offer is completed. Different amounts of the order or the offer are displayed in info boxes above the order details:

* Total amount (gross): Shows the calculated total gross amount of the order. The status bar is green when the order is a gross order. Otherwise the status bar is grey.
* Total amount (net): Shows the calculated total net amount of the order. The status bar is green when the order is a net order. Otherwise the status bar is grey.
* Total number of items: Shows the total number of order items of this order. The status bar is always grey.
* Coupon amount: Shows the granted discount from promotional coupons. The status bar is orange when a promotional coupon was used in this order. Otherwise the status bar is grey.
* Order discount: Shows the discount amount resulting from the discount granted in the first step of the order creation. The summed up discount amount of all the order items is calculated. The status bar is orange when a discount was set in the first step. Otherwise the status bar is grey.
* Open amount: Shows the open invoice amount the customer has to pay. The status bar is green when the amount is zero, i.e. if the customer has already paid the full invoice amount. Red means that the full invoice amount is still open. Orange means that the invoice amount is still partially open.

In the order details, you can adjust the *Payment method*, the *Shipping costs*, the *Shipping method* as well as the *Owner* if required. +

== Creating and applying order templates

Order templates are created in the *Setup » Orders » Order template* menu. You can select them when you manually create a new order or you can apply an order template via an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#intable-order-template[event procedure]. If you select an order template for an order, the order template data is applied to the order. After using an order template, you can edit an order as usual as well as change and adapt order information.

To create an order template proceed as follows:

[.instruction]
Creating an order template:

. Go to the *Setup » Orders » Order template* menu.
. Click on the *New template* tab.
. Enter a unique *Name*.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Name*
|Enter a name for the order template. This name is displayed in drop-down lists for selecting the order template.

| *Payment method*
|Select a payment method from the drop-down list. When applying the order template to an order, this payment method is added to the order.

| *Order status*
|Select an order status from the drop-down list. When applying the order template to an order, the order is moved to this order status.

| *Item*
|If you already added items to the order template, they are displayed in this table. Adding items is optional. The items that are displayed here will be added to the order when using this order template. The quantity and the item text are displayed for each item. Moreover, you can delete items from the order template in this table. +
*_Note:_* When you apply an order template with items, the order you want to apply it to should not have any items added yet. Items that have already been added to the order are overwritten. However, you can add more items to an order after applying the order template.

| *Adding items*
|Optionally, you can add items to the order template in this tab. These items are added to the order when the order template is applied. +
Set filters and execute a search (material:serach[role=skyBlue]) to display items. Add (material:add_shopping_cart[role=green]) the desired items to the order template. The added items are displayed in the *Item* tab. +
*Quantity* = You can add an item more than once. Each item is displayed in a new table row. Alternatively, you can adapt the *Quantity* column of an item in the *Item* tab of the table.

You can edit and adapt order templates at any time. After editing an order template, you have to save (material:save[role=green]) the order template again. Adaptations to order templates are not retroactively applied to orders but are valid from the moment of adaptation on.

Order templates are only applied to orders if you decide so. If you always want to apply an order template to specific orders, we recommend using an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#intable-order-template[event procedure]. Determine in the event procedure by the selection of the event and the filters, when and to which orders which order template should be applied.

To apply an order template when manually creating an order, select the required order template from the drop-down list *Use template* in the *Order data* area. In the order creation, you can select an order template in the first step of the order creation from the *Order template* drop-down list.
