:description: Learn how you inform your customers about offers by using an offer document. As soon as you have set up a document template, you can generate offers as a PDF or send them as an email attachment.

You can create individual offers for your customers and send it to them. Use the document *Offer* for this, which you can generate as a PDF file, for example if you want to print it or send it to your customers as an email attachment.

== Setting up a document template for offers

Before generating offers, you have to set up a document template. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Offer* to set up the template. +
Further information and instructions on setting up the document template are available on the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[Order documents] page of the manual.

== Generating a single offer document

Since offers are created individually for a customer, the offer documents are linked to the corresponding offer. This also means that the offer document can only be generated for the order type offer. Therefore, if you want to generate a PDF file for an offer, for example, you have to create the order type offer first. You generate the corresponding document as described below.

[.instruction]
Generating an offer (document) manually:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*. +
→ The *Order overview* opens.
. Use the filters to search (icon:search[role="blue"]) for the order type offer for which you want to generate the document. To do this, select *Offer* from the dropdown-list of the search filter *Type*. Adjust more filters to limit the search results, if needed.
. Open the required offer.
. Go to the *Receipts tab*.
. Select the option *Offer* from the *Create receipt* drop-down list. +
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-generate-offer-document>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings to generate the offer document. +
→ A *PDF file* of the just generated offer document opens.

== Automating sending offers documents

You created individual offers for customers, generated the corresponding documents and want to send them to your customers now? You can automate this step by setting up the matching event procedure. To send the offer document as an email attachment, we recommend the event procedure described in <<table-event-procedure-sending-offer-document>>. Proceed as follows to set up the event procedure.

[TIP]
.You don’t see the corresponding email template?
====
You don’t see the corresponding email template for the event procedure "Send offer as PDF"? That’s probably because you haven’t created it yet. You can do this in the *Setup » Client » _Select client_ » Email » Templates* menu. Click on *New email template* (icon:plus-square[role="green") and create the template according to your requirements. The name you enter here for the email template is then displayed in the event procedures. For further information about setting up email templates, refer to the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[Sending emails] page of the manual.
