:keywords: repair, repair status, repair condition
:author: team-order-core

In plentymarkets, repairs are represented by a separate order type. Repairs include items that have been returned and are in need of repair. Thus, repair orders can only be created from xref:orders:order-type-return.adoc#400[return orders].

[#repair-statuses]
== Creating statuses for repairs

Before creating returns, create different *Statuses* representing the individual steps of the repair process. This allows you to precisely track the repair process in your plentymarkets system. You can save return statuses in multiple languages.

[.instruction]
Creating statuses for repairs:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Repair*.
. Select the *Language* from the drop-down list.
. Enter the *Status* for repairs that you need for the selected language.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. If needed, repeat these steps for other languages.

[#repair-conditions]
== Creating conditions for repairs

You can use a *condition* to describe an item in more detail, e.g. if the item needs a repair after all or if you want to determine that a repair is not possible for the item. Conditions can be entered in multiple languages.

[#edit-repair]
== Editing a repair

Depending on the return reason or the condition of the items that need to be repaired, different steps have to be carried out during the process. +
Due to the fact that repairs are a separate order type, you can click on *Create orders* in the toolbar at the top of a repair and directly create a xref:orders:order-type-credit-note.adoc#[credit note], a xref:orders:order-type-warranty.adoc#[warranty] or a xref:orders:order-type-return.adoc#[return].
