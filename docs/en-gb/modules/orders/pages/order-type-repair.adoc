:description: Learn how to use the order type repair to create repairs for items that have been returned or are in need of repair. Moreover, find out how to create statuses and conditions for repairs.

In plentymarkets, repairs are represented by a separate order type. Repairs include items that have been returned and are in need of repair. Thus, repair orders can only be created from xref:orders:order-type-return.adoc#[return orders].

[#repair-statuses]
== Creating statuses for repairs

Before creating returns, create different *Statuses* representing the individual steps of the repair process. This allows you to precisely track the repair process in your plentymarkets system. You can save return statuses in multiple languages.

[.instruction]
Creating statuses for repairs:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Repair*.
. Select the *Language* from the drop-down list.
. Enter the *Status* for repairs that you need for the selected language.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. If needed, repeat these steps for other languages.

[#repair-conditions]
== Creating conditions for repairs

You can use a *condition* to describe an item in more detail, e.g. if the item needs a repair after all or if you want to determine that a repair is not possible for the item. Conditions can be entered in multiple languages.

[.instruction]
Creating conditions for repairs:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Repair*.

[#edit-repair]
== Editing a repair

Depending on the return reason or the condition of the items that need to be repaired, different steps have to be carried out during the process. +
Due to the fact that repairs are a separate order type, you can click on *Create orders* in the toolbar at the top of a repair and directly create a xref:orders:order-type-credit-note.adoc#[credit note], a xref:orders:order-type-warranty.adoc#[warranty] or a xref:orders:order-type-return.adoc#[return].
