:description: Learn about the setup of the new Order UI and which new features it has to offer.

This area contains all information about incoming orders and how to proceed after receiving orders. Depending on the sales strategy and markets you choose, orders from different xref:orders:order-referrer.adoc#[referrers] are transferred to your plentymarkets system. Apart from your own online shop, order referrers are primarily the different xref:markets:markets.adoc#[markets and price search engines].

Among others, plentymarkets offers you an extensive interface to xref:markets:amazon-setup.adoc#[Amazon]. This interface does not only include automatic synchronisation with Seller Central, but also further services offered by Amazon such as for example xref:markets:amazon-fulfilment.adoc#[Fulfilment by Amazon].

Thanks to the comprehensive xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#[eBay] interface integrated in plentymarkets, you can start listings and display eBay shop items on eBay, retrieve orders, automatically post feedback and start dunning procedures for customers ordering via eBay.

Incoming orders are collected in one menu and displayed in a consistent format so that you can easily xref:orders:working-with-orders.adoc#[manage these orders]. Each order receives an individual *order ID*. Additional steps taking place after incoming orders, such as sending the order confirmation, sending emails or generating xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[order documents], can be automated. In addition to main orders representing orders placed by customers, several other *order types* exist in plentymarkets. Order types represent different business transactions.

The following order types are available in plentymarkets:

 * xref:orders:working-with-orders.adoc#[Order]
 * xref:orders:order-type-offer.adoc#[Offer]
 * xref:orders:order-type-advance-order.adoc#[Advance order]
 * xref:orders:order-type-warranty.adoc#[Warranty]
 * xref:orders:order-type-credit-note.adoc#[Credit note]
 * xref:orders:order-type-delivery-order.adoc#[Delivery order]
 * xref:orders:order-type-repair.adoc#[Repair]
 * xref:orders:order-type-return.adoc#[Return]
 * xref:orders:order-type-multi-order.adoc#[Multi-order]
 * xref:orders:order-type-multi-order.adoc#generate-multi-credit-note[Multi credit note]

Documents necessary for a quick fulfilment process, such as xref:orders:pick-list.adoc#[pick list] and xref:orders:packing-list.adoc#[packing list] are available in plentymarkets as well.

Use the xref:fulfilment:shipping-centre.adoc#register-shipping-order[Shipping centre] to register shipping orders, edit them if needed of search for particular shipping orders.

In order to manage orders and business transactions efficiently in your plentymarkets system, you can also create xref:automation:setting-up-processes.adoc#[processes] and have them run automatically. Processes offer the highest potential of automation for your plentymarkets system. Moreover, there are also xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedures] as well as the xref:automation:procedure-manager.adoc#[procedure manager] available to you to facilitate your order processing with automatisms.

[#menu-overview-orders]
== Menu structure

The *Orders » Orders* menu is structured as follows:

image::orders:menu-structure-orders-en.png[]

* *Navigation*: Here you can navigate through different parts of the menu. The currently selected area (blue font) is displayed in the main window on the right. If you open several orders, order types or variations at once, they will be displayed underneath each other. Click on material:menu[] to expand or collapse the navigation bar.
Whenever any entries are moved, removed or added, the side navigation is automatically adjusted.
* *Toolbar*: Here you can xref:orders:order-search.adoc#search-for-orders[search for orders], xref:orders:design-order-view.adoc#configure-columns[configure columns in the overview], set the desired amount of results per page and click through the pages with the orders. +
If you select several orders (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]), you can also use the xref:orders:working-with-orders.adoc#order-group-functions[group functions]. Furthermore, you can see the *Order total* sum as well as the *Unpaid* amount of all orders in the toolbar.
* *Main window*: Here you can see whichever area is currently open.
** *Overview*: When you start a search, you’ll see the results in an overview.
The overview provides information about the orders found at a glance.
** *Detail view*: When you open an order, its details are displayed in the main window on the right.
But what if the main window is empty? Or what if you’re not happy with how the order details are arranged?
You can xref:orders:design-order-view.adoc#create-new-view[create a new view] and adjust it to your needs.
