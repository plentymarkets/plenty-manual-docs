:description: Learn about the setup of the new Order UI and which new features it has to offer.

The new Order UI is now in the so-called _open beta phase_. This means that you can start working with the menu for managing orders under *Orders » Orders (Test phase)* and familiarise yourself with the new look. In the next time, we will keep working on its performance and make further adjustments. The previous Order UI in the menu under *Orders » Edit orders* will still be available in parallel.

== Menu structure

The *Orders » Orders (Test phase)* menu is structured as follows:

image::orders:menu-structure-orders-en.png[]

* *Navigation*: Here you can navigate through different parts of the menu. The currently selected area (blue font) is displayed in the main window on the right. If you open several orders, order types or variations at once, they will be displayed underneath each other. Click on material:menu[] to expand or collapse the navigation bar.
Whenever any entries are moved, removed or added, the side navigation is automatically adjusted.
* *Toolbar*: Here you can xref:orders:order-search.adoc#search-for-orders[search for orders], xref:orders:design-order-view.adoc#configure-columns[configure columns in the overview], set the desired amount of results per page and click through the pages with the orders. +
If you select several orders (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]), you can also use the xref:orders:working-with-orders.adoc#order-group-functions[group functions]. Furthermore, you can see the *Order total* sum as well as the *Unpaid* amount of all orders in the toolbar.
* *Main window*: Here you can see whichever area is currently open.
** *Overview*: When you start a search, you’ll see the results in an overview.
The overview provides information about the orders found at a glance.
** *Detail view*: When you open an order, its details are displayed in the main window on the right.
But what if the main window is empty? Or what if you’re not happy with how the order details are arranged?
You can xref:orders:design-order-view.adoc#create-new-view[create a new view] and adjust it to your needs.
