= Customising the order view

:keywords: MyView, design order view, customise order view, adjust order view, adjust columns for order view, configure columns
:author: team-order-core

On this manual page you will learn how to customise the order overview as well as the detail view of your orders according to your needs. By using the editing mode you can for example define which columns should be displayed for your orders and in which order you want them to be shown.
The detail view differs depending on the order type. Thus, there is an individual overview for each type with the respectively relevant information.

[#select-toolbar-buttons]
== Customising the toolbar

When opening an order, different functions will be available in the toolbar that depend on the order type. Decide for yourself, which buttons you want to see at first sight and which buttons should be available in the context menu (material:more_vert[]). +
The default toolbar looks as follows:

image::orders:toolbar-new-order-ui-en.png[]

. Go to *Orders » Orders (Test phase)*.
. Carry out the search (material:search[]) to display orders.

. At the top right, click on *Edit view* (terra:design_inline_edit[role="darkGrey"]).

** Split automatically (only for delivery orders): The items are automatically split according to the settings.

In general, orders should not be deleted. Errors can occur when orders are deleted because the orders are linked to items, shipping settings and other functions such as cancellations and returns. However, newly created orders can be deleted. In case you want to delete an order that has child orders, you need to delete the child orders first.

| *Reload order*
