:description: Learn how to customise the order overview as well as the detail view of your orders. In the editing mode, decide for yourself which columns and settings you need for managing your orders.

On this manual page you will learn how to customise the order overview as well as the detail view of your orders according to your needs. By using the editing mode you can for example define which columns should be displayed for your orders and in which order you want them to be shown.
The detail view differs depending on the order type. Thus, there is an individual overview for each type with the respectively relevant information.

[#select-toolbar-buttons]
== Customising the toolbar

When opening an order, different functions will be available in the toolbar that depend on the order type. Decide for yourself, which buttons you want to see at first sight and which buttons should be available in the context menu (material:more_vert[]). +
The default toolbar looks as follows:
