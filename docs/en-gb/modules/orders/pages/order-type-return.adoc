= Order type: Return

:keywords: return, return reason, returned items, return slip, book back items, book back stock
:author: team-order-core

The order type *Return* represents the business case of items being returned. Returns can be registered manually. You can also allow your customers to register returns in the *My account* area of the online shop. Returned items are not booked back into the stock by registering a return. Thus, you first register the returned items and then decide if the items should be booked back or if additional steps such as a repair are needed. A return is a sub-type of an order, because returns are either assigned to a sales order or to a warranty.
Before you register returns, create xref:orders:order-type-return.adoc#enter-return-reasons[return reasons] and <<#status-returned-items, item statuses for returned items>>.

The default status for returns is status 9. This status is automatically assigned to every return that is registered. However, you can always determine another xref:orders:preparatory-settings.adoc#intable-default-status-return[default status for returns] in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu.

[#enter-return-reasons]
== Entering return reasons

You can enter up to 20 return reasons. When registering a return, you select a reason for each order item. Return reasons allow you to see if an item has been returned exceptionally often for the same reason. You can save return reasons in multiple languages.

[.instruction]
Entering return reasons:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Return*.
. Select the *Language* from the drop-down list.
. Enter return *reasons* for the selected language.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. If needed, repeat these steps for other languages.

[#status-returned-items]
== Entering statuses for returned items

You can enter up to 12 item statuses. You can use these statuses to determine the condition of the returned items and also to track the processing of returned items. In a return, the statuses can be selected in the *Status and tags* area. Create the required statuses to assign them based on different steps of processing. You can save return statuses for multiple languages.

[.instruction]
Entering statuses for returned items:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Return*.
. Select the *Language* from the drop-down list.
. Enter the desired *statuses* for assigning returned items for the selected language.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. If needed, repeat these steps for other languages.

[#create-and-edit-return]
== Registering and editing a return

You register a return manually when a package reaches you or you allow the customers that have a user account at your online shop to register returns in their account. After a return is registered, more possibilities for editing the return appear. For example, you can enter the status of the returned items after registering the return itself.

[#create-return-label]
== Generating a return slip

//link für Rücksendeschein nach Umzug anpassen

You can add a return slip for your customers so that it is delivered in the package along with the items. In this case, the return slip should contain blank fields for the return reasons. You can also allow customers to fill in and print the return slip in the *My account* area so that they can send it to you along with the items they return.
Before you can generate return slips, the document template xref:orders:generating-return-slips.adoc#[return slip] has to be set up in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Return slip* menu.

[TIP]
.Setting up return slips on the template
======
It’s possible add a blank return slip to every order shipped to your customers. To do so, the return slip can be generated directly in the order. A return does not have to be created for this. Another way to do this is to allow customers in the online shop to register returns in the My account area, where they can also indicate return reasons. Afterwards, the filled-in return slip can be printed. No matter how you provide your customers with return slips: The column return reasons has to be positioned below the list of order items so that return reasons can be entered.
======

Check the order items included in the return and change the options if needed, such as the item quantity, before generating a return slip.

[.instruction]
Manually generating a return slip:

. Go to *Orders » Orders (Test phase)*.
. Carry out the search (material:search[]) to display orders.
. On the right in the row of the return, click on the context menu (material:more_vert[]).
. Select *Create document* ° *Return slip*.
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Open the return for which you want to create a return slip.
. In the *Documents* area, select the option *Create document* > *Create return slip*.
. Carry out the settings for the return slip. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-generate-return-slip>>.
. Then, click on *Create*.

[TIP]
.Automatically creating a return slip

Set up an event procedure to create a return slip automatically. If you select *New return (from customer)* and filter for the referrer Webshop, you can generate pre-filled return slips. Then, simply provide the return slips to your customers via download.
