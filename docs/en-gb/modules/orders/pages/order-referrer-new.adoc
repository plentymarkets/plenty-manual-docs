:description: Learn how to work with order referrers and how to create new referrers. Order referrers help you to assign orders to a specific source. An order referrer is also required for cooperation with affiliate partners.

Omni-channel sale with plentymarkets means that you can use many different channels to offer your items to customers and, therefore, generate orders from many different sources.
Some referrers in the system are set up by default and are fixed entries that cannot be changed. Other referrers are automatically added e.g. when you integrate a plugin or xref:pos:pos.adoc#[plentyPOS].
Referrers from plugins can not be deleted. You can also add referrers manually.

Each referrer has a unique ID. Some referrers have sub-referrers. The ID for a sub-referrer is composed of the ID of the main referrer followed by two decimal numbers. *Amazon*, *eBay* and plentyPOS are examples for main referrers that have sub-referrers.
Each country platform of eBay and Amazon has a sub-referrer just like every till registered with plentyPOS will have a sub-referrer.

Regardless of their referrer, all orders are listed and can be edited in the *Orders » Orders (Test phase)* menu. There, the referrer is displayed on every order. The ID of a referrer is displayed in line with further order details. Additionally, the referrer is displayed in the *General* area of an order.
The referrer can be changed but only if it is a manually created referrer and only as long as no invoice was created yet.

[#analyse-orders]
== Filtering and evaluating orders by order referrer

The order search in the *Orders » Orders (Test phase)* menu offers many filters to narrow down the number of results. The *Referrer* filter searches for orders with a specific referrer (for example Client (store), Amazon, eBay etc.). Amazon and eBay have both general referrers and sub-referrers for each of the country platforms.

For monthly overviews, it makes sense to combine filters and to use a date as an additional filter, for example the date when orders were received.

The referrer is important for measuring how well your items sell on different platforms. This information tells you which platforms are most profitable. In addition to the search function in the *Orders » Orders (Test phase)* menu, further evaluation options are available in the xref:business-decisions:plenty-bi.adoc#[plentyBI] tool. There, you can select an order referrer and see the revenue that was generated by each referrer. Based on this, you can make well-informed decisions on how to use your advertising budget in the future in an efficient manner.
