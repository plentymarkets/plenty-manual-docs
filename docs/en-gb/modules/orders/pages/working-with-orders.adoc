Orders depict your sales and the business transactions connected to them. Those different business transactions are represented by xref:orders:order-types.adoc#[order types]. Progress during order processing is made visible by xref:orders:order-statuses.adoc#[order statuses]. All orders are registered in one central menu and in the same format. The order overview provides you with access to all important information and enables you to edit orders.

[#basic-info-create-orders]
== General information on creating orders in plentymarkets

In plentymarkets, an order is automatically created when customers place orders in your online store or on one of your implemented markets. Separate orders with different order types are created for business transactions such as xref:orders:order-type-delivery-order.adoc#[delivery orders], xref:orders:order-type-return.adoc#[returns], xref:orders:order-type-credit-note.adoc#[credit notes], xref:orders:order-type-warranty.adoc#[warranties], and xref:orders:order-type-repair.adoc#[repairs]. These orders are always linked to the main orders. The order overview allows you to open and edit orders regardless of the xref:orders:order-referrer.adoc#[order referrer]. For many order types, such as xref:orders:order-type-delivery-order.adoc#[delivery orders], it makes sense to set up xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedures] that allow you to automate part of your order processing. You will find some examples for using event procedures during order processing in the following chapters. +
Orders that were not generated in the online shop or on a market can be created xref:orders:manually-create-orders.adoc#[manually] in your system. This can be the required for orders via telephone, email or cash sales.

Before processing the first orders in your plentymarkets system, adjust the xref:orders:preparatory-settings.adoc#[preparatory settings] in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu. Save those settings once even if you have not changed the default values.

[#area-payment-terms]
=== Area: Payment terms

In the *Payment terms* area, information about *Payment due date*, *Early payment discount (%)*, and *Value date (days)* is displayed.

[IMPORTANT]
.Add payment due date
======
If you want to use value date and early payment discount, you need to enter a payment due date. If there no entry is made or the value 0 is entered for the payment due date, the payment terms will not be transferred to documents.
======

If the values were already saved in the xref:crm:edit-contact.adoc#contact-details[contact data], they will automatically be displayed here. Thus, contact data have priority. If nothing is saved in the contact data, it is checked whether the payment terms are defined in a xref:crm:preparatory-settings.adoc#create-customer-class[customer class]. If this is the case, these data are entered in the order. If the values do neither exist in the contact data nor in the customer class, the fields for the payment terms in the order remain empty. +
In an order, the payment terms can be manually entered and edited. This is regardless of the fact where the values were taken from or whether no values were transferred. +
Documents will show the values that are saved in the corresponding order. For this, also note the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#intable-payment-terms-documents[document settings]. The payment terms are displayed on the order documents xref:orders:generating-invoices.adoc#[invoice], xref:orders:generating-pro-forma-invoice.adoc#[pro forma invoice], xref:orders:generating-order-confirmation.adoc#[order confirmation], and xref:orders:generating-offer.adoc#[offer]. +
*_Note:_* The payment terms will only be displayed on documents if the corresponding order was paid with the payment method xref:payment:invoice.adoc#[Invoice] or the payment method xref:payment:cash-in-advance.adoc#[Cash in advance].

[#splitting-orders]
== Splitting orders

The function for splitting orders can be found in the toolbar of an opened order in the *Orders » Orders (Test phase)* menu. The behaviour when splitting orders depends on your xref:orders:preparatory-settings.adoc#intable-behaviour-after-splitting[basic settings] for this. +
The standard behaviour is that 2 new orders are created when an order is split. The original order is deleted. The shipping costs are recalculated for the new orders. Before splitting the order you are asked how the order items are to be distributed. +
An order can be split when: +

* it is not locked, +
* outgoing items have not been booked yet, +
* no child orders have been created (e.g. returns, delivery orders), +
* no tax-relevant documents have been created and +
* no payments have been assigned to the order yet. +

If you selected the other option *Change of order status*, 2 new orders are created as well. But the original order remains and is assigned a new order status defined by you. With this setting, it is also allowed to split orders with payments that have already assigned to it and for which tax-relevant documents (important: invoice as well as reversal document) have been created. The assigned payment as well as the documents remain with the original order and are not transferred to the split orders. +
If you want a different xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#intable-splitting-behaviour-shipping-costs[behaviour of shipping costs] than the standard one described above, you can select a different setting in the basic settings for orders.

[#redeem-coupon]

[#checklist-sales-prices]
== Check list for sales prices

Use this check list if you want to edit order items and encounter problems. In most cases this is because the details of the order don’t match the settings of the sales prices.

Therefore, check if the following settings in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu are selected for the respective price:

[%interactive]

* [ ] *1* is set for *Minimum quantity*.
* [ ] The *Currency* the order is in is activated for this price.
* [ ] No *Price type* is activated for this price, i.e. neither RRP, Special offer nor Set price is selected.
* [ ] The *Client* of the order is activated.
* [ ] The required *Customer class* is activated if it is set in the system.
* [ ] The *Country* where the order originated is activated.
* [ ] In the *Referrer* list, *Manuelle Eingabe* (manual input) is activated.
* [ ] The corresponding *Referrer* of the order is activated.

If you can place a check mark next to these options, you should be able to edit the order items. For further information, refer to the xref:item:prices.adoc#[Sales prices and price calculation] page. If you’re still looking for a specific information, you can also ask our supporters in the link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/[Forum].
