In plentymarkets, you can generate dunning letters as PDF files, for example if you want to print them or send them to your customers as an email attachment. +
You can use dunning letters to remind your customers of outstanding payments after the payment period has expired. Dunning letters can only be created when an invoice already exists since these document types are interdependent. That is also why an invoice can only be reversed if preexisting dunning letters are reversed first. Use the document type <<orders/order-documents/generating-dunning-letters#400, reversal dunning letter>> for this. +
Available are 4 dunning levels. Thus, you can remind customers several times of the outstanding payments with a new dunning letter with distinct dunning charges for each level. Set up dunning charges for each dunning level by creating corresponding variation IDs. After this you can enter the variation ID when you are creating the document, as described in <<table-orders-receipts-dunning-letter>>. +
These functions follow fiscal statutes and are in place to help you working according to GoBD (German taxation directive) regulations.
