Use the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu to select which settings should automatically be set for orders and applied under certain conditions and statuses. For example, define the standard settings for the referrer and the status of orders.

[#100]
== Important prerequisites

Standard values are selected by default in new systems. For example, status [9] for returns and status [11] for credit notes. These settings can be changed by selecting a different status.  Alternatively, go to *Setup » Orders » Status* and create a new <<orders/managing-orders#1200, order status>>. Statuses that are created there are displayed in the *Basic settings* menu and can be selected as standard statuses.

[IMPORTANT]
.Saving the basic settings
====
The basic settings in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu have to be saved once when the system is first set up. The settings will not go into effect until they have been saved. Thus, save the settings even if you have not made any changes, i.e. even if you want to use the default settings.
====

[WARNING]
.Important: User login
====
Whenever you carry out changes in this menu and save the settings, other users are logged out automatically and have to log in again. This ensures that the changes also apply to the other user profiles. Therefore, it is recommended that you announce changes to other users of your system in advance.

|Setting |Explanation

| [#intable-default-referrer]*Default referrer*
|Select a provider, a market or the *Online store*. This referrer will automatically be set by default for all orders. Select *Manual entry* if you do not want to use a default setting, i.e. if you want to individually save each order referrer.

| [#intable-default-status-return]*Standard status for returns*
|Select which status should automatically be set for <<orders/managing-orders#400, returns>>. The status can be changed when creating the return.

| [#intable-default-status-cancelled-orders]*Status of cancelled orders*
|Select the status range for cancelled orders. +
_Background_: As soon as an order enters this status range, stock will no longer be reserved for the items included in the order. This means that the stock becomes available for other orders. Statuses can be excluded from this automatic function if necessary. For example, if you do not want item to be reversed if they have a particular status. +
_Important:_ Save the range of statuses in ascending order, e.g. [8.0] to [8.5].

| [#intable-default-status-order-reservation]*Status for order reservations*
|As soon as an order enters this status, stock is automatically reserved for the items included in the order. You can set up a status up to and including status [6.9].

|Choose the criterion according to which the warehouse is selected. +
*a) depending on the country of delivery* = The warehouse that was saved for the *country of delivery* in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Countries of delivery*. +
*_Tipp_*:If you select this option, make sure to check which warehouse is assigned to the respective delivery countries. +

1) The *Priority* of the warehouse (option available in the <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#300, warehouse settings>>). +
In case of sufficient or identical stock in all warehouses, the warehouse with the highest priority. This first criterion does not consider the actual amount of stock. Rather, it checks whether enough stock is available or not. Thus, a warehouse is not favoured because it has more stock than another, but rather because it has a higher priority. Conversely, if a warehouse does not have sufficient stock, it will not be selected. +
2) Sufficient stock has to be available. +
*e) depending on the lowest stock level* = The order is assigned to the warehouse with the lowest stock level for the order item. +
*f) depending on the warehouse priority and the lowest stock level* = The order is assigned to a warehouse according to the following criteria. The following information is checked one after another: +
1) The *Priority* of the warehouse (option available in the warehouse settings). +
In case of sufficient or identical stock in all warehouses, the warehouse with the highest priority. This first criterion does not consider the actual amount of stock. Rather, it checks whether enough stock is available or not. Thus, a warehouse is not favoured because it has more stock than another, but rather because it has a higher priority. Conversely, if a warehouse does not have sufficient stock, it will not be selected. +
2) The warehouse with the lowest stock level is selected. +
*g) depending on the warehouse priority and the highest stock level (fallback: main warehouse)* = First, the settings regarding warehouse priority are checked for the warehouse assignment. The second criterion is the stock level, assignment is to the highest stock level. If no warehouse fulfils these criteria, which means that all stock levels are insufficient, the main warehouse of the variation is assigned to the order. +
*h) depending on the warehouse priority and the lowest stock level (fallback: main warehouse)* First, the settings regarding warehouse priority are checked for the warehouse assignment. The second criterion is the stock level, assignment is to the lowest stock level.

*YES* = The quantities of bundle items and bundle components can be changed manually later in order processing. +
_Note_: Changing quantities manually after the order is created does not automatically cause an adaption of the quantities of the bundle components or an adaption of the prices.

| [#intable-status-change-missing-stock]*Status changes to [4] instead of [5] if stock is missing*
|Set this option to *YES* if an order should only be cleared for shipping when there is enough stock in the warehouse. As soon as enough stock has been booked into the warehouse, the <<orders/managing-orders#1200, order status>> is changed from *[4]* to *[5]*. +

The order items not selected here are taken over into the first new order. The selected order items are taken over into the second new order. If you choose this option for the shipping costs, they are always taken over for the first new order. The second order does not get any shipping costs. +
*Take over shipping costs to the order with the highest item value, the other gets none* = he shipping costs of the original order are taken over into the new order with the highest item value. The second order does not get any shipping costs.

*Change of order status* = By using this option, two new orders are created as well. But the original order remains and is assigned a new order status defined by you. Select this order status from the second drop-down list. We recommend an order status in the cancellation range so that reserved stock does not remain reserved. But depending on your order processing a different order status might be more fitting. +
With this setting, it is also allowed to split orders with payments already assigned to it and for which tax-relevant documents (important: invoice as well as reversal document) have been created.

[#250]
== Property transfer

You can determine which order information (properties of an order) are transferred to another order. For example, properties are copied when you create delivery orders or returns. Properties are information that are part of an order, e.g. the shipping profile, the payment status or the document language. Properties can belong to an order or to an order item. +
*_Note_*: The properties in this menu are not the <<item/settings/properties#500, variation properties>> you create yourself, as e.g. the order properties.

[IMPORTANT]
.Default for transferred properties
====
All needed properties are transferred by default from one order type into another order type. You don't have to change any of the settings in this menu. Therefore, if you adapt these property settings, then only after careful consideration.
====

Use the menu *Setup » Orders » Property transfer* to determine which properties are to be copied. You determine this individually for different combinations, e.g. for the combination order (source) to delivery order (target). Not all of the properties are available for copying. The table column *Source* displays where a property comes from. *Internal* means that the property is a system property. *Interface* means that the property was created via a plugin or REST. +
When opening the menu, some filters are preset. Adapt these as described below if they don't meet your requirements.

[.instruction]
Activating properties for transfer:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Transfer property*.
. Open the search filters (icon:filter_alt[set=material]).
. Select for the filter *Order type source* the order type from which the properties are to be transferred.
. Select for the filter *Order type target* the order type to which the properties are to be transferred.
. Execute the search. +
→ The properties are displayed in the table.
. Activate or deactivate the properties you want to transfer in the column *Transfer order property*.
. Activate or deactivate the properties you want to transfer in the column *Transfer order item property*. +
→ The activated properties are transferred from now on.

In addition, the following filters are also available to you in the search (icon:filter_alt[set=material]):

* *Only display transferable properties* = Select *Yes* if only the properties that can be transferred from one order type to another are to be displayed in the table. Select *No* if all properties are to be displayed in the table, those that cannot be transferred as well.
* *Property ID* = Enter a distinct property ID for which you want to search. Only one ID at a time can be entered.
* *Source* = If you don't select anything, the properties from all sources are displayed. If you select *Internal* or *Interface*, only the properties from the respective source are displayed.

[#300]
== Authorising back end users to edit orders

To authorise users of the type *back end* to open orders, you have to save default statuses for *returns* and *credit notes* here. No status is saved here by default. +
In addition, back end users have to be <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#105, authorised to edit orders>>.
Back end users also have to be authorised to create orders of the type *return*, *warranty* and *repair*. For this, back end users have to be authorised to edit these default statuses of these order types saved in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu. +
Moreover, define what users are allowed to see in the system. To do so, determine <<business-entscheidungen/benutzerkonten-zugaenge#100, visibilities>>, for example for warehouses and order statuses.
