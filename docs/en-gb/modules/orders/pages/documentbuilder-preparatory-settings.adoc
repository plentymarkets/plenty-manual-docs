[#defining-number-ranges]
== Setting number ranges for the document types


Use the number ranges in the *Setup » Documents » Number ranges* menu to create consecutive numbers for the different document types. These numbers allow you to clearly identify and track the documents generated by the system.
For more information, see the manual page xref:orders:setting-number-ranges.adoc#[Setting number ranges].
