:description: Learn how to generate pick lists as PDF or CSV files in order to print or import them. Moreover, find out how to display the desired item data.

In plentymarkets, you can generate pick lists as PDF files, for example if you want to print them or import them into another software. If you display barcodes on your pick lists, you can scan items directly and book outgoing items after completion of the picking process.

== Displaying item data

Use the *Setup » Orders » Documents » Pick list* menu to determine which item data should be displayed on your pick lists, such as *Item ID*, *Manufacturers* or *Item price*. +

You can carry out individual settings for most of the fields described in <<table-options-pick-list>> concerning the parameters width, font size and font weight that allow you to choose an individual layout for the pick list. Use the *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) to check the results of the settings while preparing the document template.
To display the fields on the pick list in the order of your choice, assign the position numbers 1 to 14 from the respective drop-down list to them. Select the option *Pos* for fields that should not be displayed on the pick list.

If you enter the value 0 for both variables, the *ID barcode* is displayed in the upper left corner of the pick list. For further information on positioning elements by assigning coordinates, refer to the respective xref:orders:order-documents-new.adoc#600[manual page].

|Uses the first GTIN of a variation and displays it as a barcode. GTINs are first created as barcodes and then added to the data of specific items. The GTIN barcode that you created first and that therefore has the lowest ID is used on the pick list. +

The quantity is displayed next to the storage location by default. Select the option *Do not show the quantity next to the storage location* if you do not want to display this information on the pick list.

| *BBD*
|Determine how the best before date of a variation should be displayed.

| *Batch*
|Determine how the batch number of a variation should be displayed.

| *Free text*
|Determine if a free text field should be displayed on the pick list. +
Free text fields have to be created in advance in the *Setup » Item » Free text fields* menu. After defining the free text fields, link them to their corresponding items and enter values for the fields. This is done in the *Fields* tab of an item. +
For further information, refer to the xref:item:managing-items.adoc#70[Managing items] page of the manual.

Deactivate the check box for the parameters that should not be displayed on the pick list. The selection is also valid for variations.

| *Item price*
|Determine how the item price should be displayed on the pick list.

A template is needed for displaying your online shop's letter paper, i.e. a page containing your company information, logo and layout elements according to your corporate design.

→ The PDF template is displayed in the *Templates* tab. In this tab, you can preview or delete the PDF template.

[TIP]
====
If your template contains a header, you should position the header above the actual pick list. Make sure that the top margin is wide enough for your header and adjust the value if necessary (see <<table-options-pick-list>>).
