In plentymarkets, you can generate pick lists as PDF or CSV files, for example if you want to print them or import them into another software. You can display barcodes on your pick lists. These allow you to scan items directly and book outgoing items after completion of the picking process.

== Displaying item data

Use the menu *Setup » Orders » Documents » Pick list* to determine which item data should be displayed on your pick lists, such as *Item ID*, *Manufacturers* or *Item price*. +

You can carry out individual settings for most of the fields described in <<table-orders-options-pick-list>> concerning the parameters *width*, font size and font weight that allow you to individualise the layout of the warehouse pick list. Use the *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) to check the results of the settings while preparing the PDF template.
To display the fields on the pick list in the order of your choice, assign the position numbers 1 to 14 from the respective drop-down list to them. Select the option *Pos* for fields that should not be displayed on the pick list.

| *Best before date*
|Determine how the best before date of a variation is displayed.

| *Batch*

== Uploading a PDF template:

A template is needed for displaying your online shop's letter paper, i.e. a page containing your company information, logo and layout elements according to your corporate design. This template needs to be in PDF format. In plentymarkets, it is possible to use a document template in PDF format to create the pick list. Proceed as described below to create a PDF template.

[.instruction]
Uploading a PDF template:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Documents » Pick list*.
. Click on *PDF template*.
. Open the *New template* tab.
. Click on *Select file* and select a PDF file as a template.
. *Save* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The PDF template appears in the *Templates* tab. In this tab, you can preview or delete the PDF template.

[TIP]
====
You should place a header above the actual pick list if your template contains a header. Make sure that top margin is wide enough for your header and adjust the value if necessary (see <<table-options-pick-list>>).

[.instruction]

|Setting |Explanation

| *Order status*
|Select the status of the orders that should be included in the pick list.

| *Owner*
|In the drop-down list, select the owner for the orders for which the documents should be generated. Select *ALL* if documents for all owners should be generated.

| *Client (store)*

*ALL* = shop and clients

| *Warehouse*
|In the drop-down list, select one warehouse or *ALL*.

| *Sorting*
|In the drop-down list, select the method for sorting the items on the pick list. The options *Item ID*, *Item number*, *Storage location position* and *Standard category’s name from the main shop (first level only)* are available.

| *Order limit*
|In the drop-down list, select how many orders should be handled at a time. Set a value between 5 and 300. +
The maximum number of orders that can be handled at a time equals the maximum of orders that can be selected. If the number of orders that should be handled exceeds the maximum of orders that can be selected, the process has to be repeated accordingly. The lower the chosen setting, the more efficient is the system performance.

| *Display format*
|In the drop-down list, select a data format for exporting the pick list. Select between the following options: *PDF* and *CSV*.

| *Change order status*
|Select a status that should be applied to the orders after generating the pick list. +
The status change is an important tool to make sure that the process is not carried out twice for orders that have already been handled.

[TIP]
====
The link *Change PDF pick list* takes you to the settings in the menu *Setup » Orders » Documents » Pick list*, in which the document settings and the PDF template for the pick list are configured. The link *Change CSV pick list* takes you to a separate menu in which you can set up the columns that are displayed on a pick list generated in CSV format.
