Orders depict your sales and the business transactions connected to them. Those different business transactions are represented by order types. Progress during order processing is made visible by xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1200[order statuses]. The following descriptions will show you how to use order types and order status and thus process orders efficiently. All orders are registered in one central menu and in the same format. The xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1400[order overview] provides you with access to all important information and enables you to edit orders.

[#100]
== General information on creating orders in plentymarkets

In plentymarkets, an order is automatically created when customers place orders in your plentyShop or on one of your implemented markets. Separate orders with different order types are created for business transactions such as xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#300[delivery orders], xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#400[returns], xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#500[credit notes], xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#600[warranties] and xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#700[repairs]. These orders are always linked to the main orders. The xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1400[order overview] allows you to open and edit orders regardless of the xref:orders:order-referrer.adoc#[referrer]. For many order types, such as xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#300[delivery orders], it makes sense to set up xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedures] that allow you to automate part of your order processing. You will find some examples for using event procedures during order processing in the following chapters. +
Orders that were not generated in the online shop or on a market can be created xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#200[manually] in your system. This can be the required for orders via telephone, email or cash sales.

Before processing the first orders in your plentymarkets system, adjust the xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#[basic settings] in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu. Save those settings once even if you have not changed the default values.

[#200]
== Creating orders manually

You can manually create orders directly in the plentymarkets system, e.g. when an order is telephoned in. There are several options available to manually create orders:

* in the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#240[contact overview]
* in the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#245[customer account]
* from an existing xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#220[order]
* from a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#230[cash sale]

These options are described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Emailing
====
When you manually create orders, emails will not be sent automatically to the customer. The reason that no emails will be sent is that your system does not know when you are done with all settings for a manual order. To send emails for a manual order you need to open the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1550[Email] tab and send the emails individually.

[WARNING]
.Payment method and order documents for cash sale
====
Make sure to select the right *payment method* when you create an order for a cash sale. When manually creating a cash sale order the order will not be assigned to a customer. This is why you should manually create xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[Order documents] such as the invoice right away while entering and processing the cash sale. Order documents can be created in the *Receipts* tab of the order.

=== beta: Creating an order or an offer in the contact overview

This chapter describes how to create an order or an offer in the contact overview in the *CRM » Contacts* menu. This is a new user interface is for now only _beta_ integration, development and optimisation are ongoing. All other ways to create orders remain unaffected by this and can still be used.

[#250]
==== Carrying out default settings

When creating orders or offers via the contact overview, data such as addresses or clients are taken directly from the contact data if they are saved there. Thus, in most cases contact data have priority. Additionally, some default settings, which are a fallback if the data are not in the contact, are available. +
In order to optimise the order creation, these default settings should be determined first. *_Note_* that these default settings also apply to offers which are created with this user interface.

[.instruction]
Proceed as follows to carry out the default settings:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Sales Order [Beta]*.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-default-settings-order-contact>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

The steps described in the following chapters are the same for orders and offers.

The user interface is designed to create orders quickly and easily. This is especially helpful when orders are telephoned in. At first, the order details such as addresses and payment method are entered. After that, order items are added and the last step is the final check and completion of the order.

[#270]

==== Adding items

In this step, the order details are not displayed. They are available again in the third step where you finalise the order. *_But note_* that only shipping method and costs can be edited in the third step.

To complete an order, order items have to be added. Execute a search (material:search[]) to find and then add the required items. You can choose between different filters (material:filter_alt[]) for the item search:

* Item ID
* Item name
* Variation number
* Variation ID
* Barcode
* Manufacturer
* Item tag

Additionally, you can activate the options *Only display active items*, *Only display items in stock*, *Only display sales warehouses* and *Only display items with valid sales prices*. If you set *a) a warehouse can be assigned for each order* in the basic settings, the option *Only display sales warehouses* is not available for the search because you already determined the warehouse before.

The number of items added is displayed on the shopping cart icon (material:shopping_cart[]) which is located above the table. If you want to check or delete the added items, open this shopping cart (material:shopping_cart[]).

Depending on the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#intable-shopping-cart-type[shopping cart type] you selected in the default settings, a sideward overlay opens or the view jumps directly to the shopping cart table. Irrespective of the shopping cart type, you can edit the *Quantity* as well as the *Sales price*. As soon as field entries are adapted, updates have to be carried out. You can do these either by clicking on *Refresh sales price* (material:refresh[]) directly next to the item. Or you use the button *Refresh sales prices* below the shopping cart. Only after updating the prices can you move on to the next step of the order creation.

The following applies to the sales prices:

* If no valid sales price could be detected, a sales price has to be entered manually. Completing an order is only possible with valid sales prices.
* It is allowed to enter the price 0.00.
* If a sales price is entered that is lower than the purchase price, an error message is displayed. You can still set this lower price if you want to.
* Carry out all changes for order items in this step of the order creation, in the third and last step this is not possible. Navigating back and forth through the steps remains possible.

Moreover, you can also delete items in the shopping cart. To do so, click on *Delete* (material:delete[]). A further editing option of the order items are the properties. To do so, take note of the following chapter xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#287[Order item properties].

==== Order item properties

You can edit the order item properties in the shopping cart. Any changes made here are only for the order created just now. The properties themselves stay as they are configured in the system. Only the properties already created and configured in the system are available in the order creation. +
If you want to create and edit properties or are not yet familiar with the structure of properties, refer to the manual chapter xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Properties] first.

In order to link a property with an order item, the property has to be marked as *Order property* in the *Options* area of the property settings. Also set possible surcharges and VAT rates for the property in the xref:item:properties.adoc#property-options[Options] area. The values added here will be included on the order calculations.

If a property is already linked with an order item, it will be displayed on the corresponding order item. How the order item properties are displayed depends on your xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#intable-shopping-cart-type[shopping cart type] selection.

[tabs]

The following information about order item properties can be found in the editing window *Edit properties of [selected order item with ID]*:

* *Name* = The name of the property is displayed. A red asterisk marks the property as a *required* property. Whether a property is required is determined in the xref:item:properties.adoc#property-options[Options] area of the property settings. Select *Required* from the *Order options* drop-down list.
* *Value* = The value of the property is displayed. The value is editable. Depending on the property type, you can either make a selection, edit the value, add a value or upload a file. The changes are only valid for this order.
* *Surcharge* = The surcharge of the property is displayed, if a surcharge is set for the property. The surcharge is editable. The changes are only valid for this order.

Moreover, some further editing options are available to you here. By clicking on *Delete* (material:delete[]), you remove the property from this order item. This property is then not included in the order and the order calculations. +
You can also add more already existing properties. Select a property from the drop-down list *Select property* and add it to this order item by clicking on *Add property* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) +
When you are done with all adaptations, click on *Save properties*. By clicking on *Cancel*, none of the changes are saved. The editing window is closed and you can edit the properties of other order items in the same way.

If you want to have the properties displayed on documents, you have to set this in the configurations of the property itself. Make sure that in the xref:item:properties.adoc#property-visibilities[Visibilities] area of each property the option

* *Display on documents* from the *Display everywhere* drop-down list as well as
* the correct clients from the drop-down list *Clients* are selected.

Where on the document the properties are displayed depends on each property and its configurations. Properties for which no VAT rate was set in the *Options* area of the configuration or for which the option *Display as additional costs* in the *Order property* drop-down list was selected are displayed underneath the totals. Other properties are displayed in the order item table.

When you are done with editing the order item properties and the shopping cart, the next step in the order creation is the *Overview*. In this step, the order item properties are not displayed again. Therefore, make sure that you are done with all changes before you move forward with the order creation.

[#290]
==== Overview: Completing the order

In this last step, the order is completed. Different amounts of the order are displayed in info boxes above the order details:

* Total amount (gross): Shows the calculated total gross amount of the order. The status bar is displayed green when the order is a gross order. Otherwise the status bar is grey.
* Total amount (net): Shows the calculated total net amount of the order. The status bar is displayed green when the order is a gross order. Otherwise the status bar is grey.
* Total number of items: Shows the total number of order items of this order. The status bar is always displayed in grey.
* Coupon amount: Shows the granted discount from promotional coupons. The status bar is displayed in orange when a promotional coupon was used in this order. Otherwise the status bar is grey.
* Order discount: Shows the discount amount resulting from the discount granted in the first step of the order creation. The summed up discount amount of all the order items is calculated. The status bar is displayed in orange when a discount was set in the first step. Otherwise the status bar is grey.
* Open amount: Shows the open invoice amount the customer has to pay. The status bar is displayed green when the amount is zero. i.e. the customer has already paid the full invoice amount. Red means the full invoice amount is still open. Orange means the invoice amount is still partially open.

In the order details, the *Shipping method* and the *Shipping costs* can be adapted if required. +
Moreover, you can enter one or more coupon codes in the *Coupon codes* field to redeem these with this order. Enter a coupon code and press _enter_ or click outside the field. It is immediately checked if the coupon is redeemable. Redeemable coupons turn green, display the value of the coupon and show with a tooltip what type of coupon it is. Irredeemable coupon codes turn red and display *Not redeemable* instead of the entered code. Repeat this with more coupon codes, if needed. +
The values of the coupons are set off against the order value. Coupons are not added as an order position in the shopping cart. Coupons cannot be redeemed for offers. This means that the input field *Coupon codes* is only available for order creation and not for offer creation.

Below the order details, a table with the added order items is displayed. In addition to the information given in the previous adding items view, more prices and the VAT rate are shown. The VAT rates are editable if you allowed this in the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#250[default settings].  +
Moreover, you can adapt the *Description* in this table. The adapted item description is only taken over for this individual order. This means that the changed description is added to the order data and also the order documents of this particular order. Outside this order, the item description already saved in the system remains. There is a restriction for the *Description* of 1.500 characters.


[.collapseBox]
.*Customise table*

[#295]
=== Creating and applying order templates

You can create order templates in the *Setup » Orders » Order template* menu. You can then select these when you manually create a new order or you can apply an order template with an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#intable-order-template[event procedure]. If you select an order template for an order, the order template data is applied to the order. After using an order template, you can edit an order as usual as well as change and adapt order information.

Proceed as follows to create an order template:

[.instruction]
Creating an order template:

. Navigate to the *Setup » Orders » Order template* menu.
. Change to the tab *New template*.
. Enter a distinct *Name*.
. Select a *Payment method* and an *Order status* from the corresponding drop-down lists.
. Otionally, use *Add item(s)* to add items.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the order template.

[[table-order-templates]]
.Order template fields
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting|Explanation

|*Name*
|Enter a name for the order template. This name is then displayed in drop-down lists to select this order template.

|*Payment method*
|Select a payment method from the drop-down list. This payment method. When applying the order template to an order, this payment method is then added to the order.

|*Order status*
|Select an order status from the drop-down list. When applying the order template to an order, the order is then moved to this order status.

|*Item*
|If you already added items to the order template, these are displayed in this table. Adding items is optional. The quantity and the item text are displayed for each item. Moreover, you can delete items from the order template in this table. +
*_Note_* that when you apply an order template with items, the order you want to apply it to should not have any items added. Already added items to the order are overwritten. But you can add more items to an order after applying an order template.

|*Add item(s)*
|Optionally, you can add items to the order template in this tab. These items are then added to the order when the order template is applied. +
Set filters and execute a search (icon:search[role="blue"]) to have items to choose from displayed. Add (icon:cart-plus[role="green"]) the items to the order template. The added items are then displayed in the *Item* tab. +
*Quantity* = You can add an item more than once. They are then each displayed in a new table row. Alternatively, you can adapt the *Quantity* column of an item in the *Item* tab of the table.

|====

You can edit and adapt order templates any time. After editing an order template, you have to save (icon:save[role="green"]) the order template again. Adaptations to order templates are not retroactively applied  to orders but are valid from the moment of adaptation on.

Order templates are only applied to orders if you decide so. If you always want to apply an order template to specific orders, we recommend using an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#intable-order-template[event procedure]. Determine in the event procedure by the selection of the event and the filters, when and to which orders which order template is to be applied.

To apply an order template while xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#200[manually creating an order], select the required order template from the drop-down list *Use template* in the *Order data* area. In the new order creation (Beta), you can select an order template in the first step of the order creation. Select the order template from the drop-down list above the order details.

[#300]
== Working with delivery orders

*Delivery orders* enable you to create multiple delivery orders for the items included in the main order. This way, items from the main order can be shipped individually or in parts. Thus, delivery orders allow you to immediately ship items that are in stock and ship unavailable items later. Delivery orders can be shipped using one or several shipping providers. +
You can create delivery orders *manually*, *automatically* or using an *event procedure*.

[WARNING]
.Transfer all order items to delivery orders
====
When you create delivery orders from a main order, make sure to transfer _all_ order items into delivery orders. If you do not and leave order items on the main order, stock and warehouse errors will occur.
====

[#310]
=== Characteristics of delivery orders

In general, delivery orders have the following characteristics:

* It is *not* possible to modify the order items included in a delivery order after the delivery order has been created.
* The *price* and *weight* of an order are taken from the main order.
* The order language os taken from the main order.
* *Address label*, *delivery note*, *pro forma invoice* and *entry certificate (Gelangensbestätigung)* can be created in the *Receipts* tab of the respective order.
* The *invoice* and all other documents are created centrally in the main order.
* When creating a delivery order, the stock reservation for the quantity included in the delivery order is transferred from the main order to the delivery order.

[IMPORTANT]
.Same order status
====
The status of the main order is always identical to the status of the delivery order with the lowest status. For example, if a main order with the status *5.0* has two delivery orders, of which one changes to status *6.5*, the status of the main order is not changed to *6.5* until the second delivery order has also moved to status 6.5.
====

[#320]
=== Carrying out basic settings for delivery orders

[WARNING]
.Assigning a warehouse for each order item
====
To use delivery orders, you have to select the option *b) a warehouse can be assigned for each stock unit* for the xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#intable-warehouse-assignment[Assignment of warehouses] in the menu *Setup » Orders » Settings*.
====

Before working with delivery orders, go to *Setup »Orders »Order types » Delivery order* to select an option for splitting up main orders into delivery orders.

[.instruction]
Selecting an option for splitting up orders into delivery orders:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Delivery order*.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-order-types-delivery-order-options>>.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

|The delivery orders are created according to the different *Warehouses and shipping profiles* of the items included in the main order.

| *Warehouse stock and net stock*
|The delivery orders are created according to the different *Warehouse stock and net stock* of the items included in the main order.
|====

[#330]
=== Manually creating delivery orders

If necessary, you can manually create delivery orders via the main order. When you do so, you need to select the item orders and quantities for each delivery order.

We recommend to generally create delivery orders for *all* order items in the main order. If one or several items remain in the main order without being assigned to a delivery order, problems may be caused in your plentymarkets system.

In addition, the quantity you indicate for *DelOrdQua* (quantity to be transferred to the delivery order) must not exceed the quantity indicated for *Unass.Quantity* (unassigned quantity).

[.instruction]
Manually creating delivery orders:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the order for which delivery orders should be created.
. Open the *Delivery* tab.
. Enter the *Quantity* that should be transferred to the delivery order in the field *DelOrdQua* (quantity to be transferred to the delivery order).
. Click on the *gear-wheel icon* (icon:cog[]) to create the delivery order. +
→ The delivery order is created.
. Repeat the process to create further delivery orders.

[#340]
=== Automatically creating delivery orders

[IMPORTANT]
.Requirement for automatically creating delivery orders
====
This function can only be used if no delivery order has ben created for the main order yet.
====

When automatically creating delivery orders, the criteria for splitting up orders into delivery orders described in <<table-order-types-delivery-order-options>>. apply. Thus, the items and quantities to be included in the delivery orders to not have to be selected manually. Instead, the system applies the selected option and transfers the items and quantities from the main order to the delivery orders.

[.instruction]
Automatically creating delivery orders

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the order for which delivery orders should be generated.
. Open the *Delivery* tab.
. Click on *Generate delivery orders automatically* (icon:cog[]). +
→ The delivery orders are created.

[#350]
=== Creating delivery orders with an event procedure

An ideal way to create delivery orders is using an event procedure. This way, you can determine when and how delivery orders are created from a main order. Below, three examples for creating delivery orders with an event procedure are described.

Set up one or all of the following event procedures and carry out the described settings.

==== Example A: Event procedure “Create delivery order when order is received”

Use the following settings if you want delivery orders to be generated as soon as a new order enters your plentymarkets system.

Because this event procedure comes into effect directly upon reception of a new order, the status of the main order is not taken into consideration. Thus, delivery orders will also be created for main orders that are in status *3.0* (or *1.0* if you work with auction platforms such as eBay) and will adopt the status of the main order.

=== Editing main orders and delivery orders

To open main orders, variable users have to be xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#100[authorised] to view all warehouses linked to the delivery orders of the main order. Check the settings in the menu *Setup» Settings » User »Accounts » Tab: Rights* for this.

If you want to delete a main order, the respective delivery orders have to be deleted first. Delivery orders can be deleted individually or with the group function in the order search. The main order can only be deleted after this is done. But note that as soon as tax relevant documents exist, orders cannot be deleted any more.

Further order items can be added or deleted from the main order. However, you can only delete order items from the main order if they are not included in the delivery orders. Thus, you can increase or reduce the item quantity included in the main order. Make sure to only delete quantities that are not assigned to delivery orders.

[WARNING]
.Deleting order items of a delivery order
====
It is technically possible to delete order items that are already included in a delivery order. But you should avoid this in order to prevent errors.
====

[#400]
== Working with return orders

The order type return depicts the business transaction of receiving returned goods. You and your staff can create return orders manually. In addition, you can allow customers in your online shop to register returns in the *My account* area. Registering the return does not book the returned items back into your stock. First, you register the returned items and then you decide whether they should be booked back into the stock or if further steps, for example a repair, are necessary. Return orders are subordinated orders because they are always linked to a main order or a warranty.
Before returns can be registered in your system, you have to set up xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#410[reasons for returns] and xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#420[item statuses] for returned items.

The default status for returns is status 9. Every registered return is automatically assigned this status. However, you can change the default status according to your requirements in the menu *Setup » Orders » Settings* by selecting another xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#intable-default-status-return[default status for returns].

[#410]
=== Creating reasons for returns

In plentymarkets, you can create up to 20 reasons for returns. When registering returns, you can choose a reason for each returned item. Reasons for returns can help you later to determine whether an item was frequently returned for the same reason.
You can add return reasons for several languages.

[.instruction]
Creating reasons for returns:

. Go to the menu *Setup » Orders » Order types » Return*.
. Select a *Language* from the drop-down list.
. Enter *Reasons for returns* for the selected language.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. If needed, repeat this for other languages.

[#420]
=== Creating statuses for returned items

You can create up to 12 statuses for returned items. You can use these statuses, for example, to display the state of the returned items or the progress of the return process The item statuses are available in the *Overview* tab in a return order. Create the necessary statuses according to your requirements to depict the progress. You can add statuses for several languages.

[.instruction]
Creating statuses for returned items:

. Go to the menu *Setup » Orders » Order types » Return*.
. Select a *Language* from the drop-down list.
. Enter the *statuses* that should be assigned to returned items for the selected language.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. If needed, repeat this for other languages.

[#440]
=== Creating and editing returns

You can either manually create a return once you receive the returned goods or you can allow your customers to register returns directly in the My account are of the online shop. After a return has been registered, more options for editing become available. For example, the status of the returned items can only be entered after registration.

==== Creating a return

[.instruction]
To create a return, proceed as described:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the order or the warranty for which the return is to be created.
. In the table-settings-return Overview tab, click on *Return* and select the option *create*. +
→ A window for creating the return opens.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-settings-return>>.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The return is created and opens in a new tab.

|====

After having created a return, you can select an item status in the Stock units tab of the return. In addition, more editing options become available.

[#450]
=== Creating a return slip

You can include a return slip in every shipment of items sent to your customers. In this case, the return slip should contain blank fields for the reasons of return. Alternatively, you can allow your customers to fill out the return slip in the *My account* area of the online shop and to print it after having filled in the reasons for the return. The return slip can then be included in the return delivery.
Before creating return slips, the document template xref:orders:generating-return-slips.adoc#[Return slip] has to be set up in the menu *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Return slip*.

[TIP]
.Displaying reasons for returns on the document template
====
To include a blank return slip in every shipment regardless whether items will be returned or not, create a return slip directly in the main order. You can also allow your customers to register returns and select reasons for those returns in the My account area of the online shop. Your customer can then print the filled in return slip. No matter which of these options you use: in order to be able to insert reasons for a return, the column including those reasons has to be placed below the list of items.
====

Check the list of returned items and change data if necessary, for example the quantities, *before* creating a return slip in the *Receipts* tab of the return order.

[.instruction]
Creating a return slip manually:

. Open the return order and then the *Receipts* tab.
. Select the option *Return slip* from the drop-down list *Create receipt*. +
→ A new window opens.
. Carry out the settings for the return slip.
. *Save* the settings to create the return slip.

[TIP]
.Generating a return slip automatically
====
Set up an event procedure that automatically generates return slips. If you select the event *New return (by customer)* and the filter *Client (shop)*, blank return slips are generated with each incoming return and only have to be provided for downloading.
====

[#460]
=== Reversing stock

Once returned items reach you, you can partly or completely reverse the stock. Alternatively, it is also possible to completely reset the outgoing items that have been booked while processing the main order.

[.instruction]
Reversing stock:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.

== Working with credit note orders

Credit note orders are used for reimbursing your customers, for example after a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#400[return order]. A credit note in plentymarkets does not represent a reverse invoice but a refund. Credit note orders are created from an existing main order in the menu *Orders » Edit orders*. Thus, a credit note is always linked to a main order. The credit notes created in a credit note order are included in your financial accounting such as the *DATEV* export.

[#510]
=== Setting a default status for credit notes

Before creating credit note orders, check the xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#intable-default-status-credit-note[default status for credit notes] in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu. Change the default status when necessary and then save your settings.

[#520]
=== Creating a credit note order

A credit note order is always linked to an already existing order in your plentymarkets system. That is why you have to open the main order in the overview first, before creating a credit note order.

[TIP]
.Creating a credit note order in the main order or in a return order
====
If a customer has already paid for an order and then decides against the purchase before you have shipped the goods and booked outgoing items, we recommend creating a credit note including all order items in the main order and to cancel the original main order.

In case payment, outgoing items and delivery have already taken place and a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#400[return order] or a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#700[repair] is created, the credit note order is generated directly in the corresponding return order or repair.
====

[.instruction]
Opening an order:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Search (icon:search[role="blue"]) for the order.
. Open the order for which a credit note order should be created. +
→ The order opens in a separate tab.

[.instruction]
Creating a credit note order:

. Open the *Overview* tab of the order for which a credit note order is to be created.
. Click on the *Credit note* drop-down list.
. Select an option according to the explanations given in <<table-options-credit-note-order>>. +

| *from individual items*
|A window to select individual item positions opens.
|====

If a credit note order already exists for an order, there will be a note on the right-hand side of the *Overview* tab notifying you that there is a *Credit note available*. In addition, the credit note order is linked in the *Overview* tab and can be found by using the *Credit note / search* drop-down list.

[#530]
=== Generating a credit note

[IMPORTANT]
.Setting up a document template
====
Before generating credit notes, you have to set up the xref:orders:generating-credit-notes.adoc#[document template for credit notes]. This is done in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Location » [Select location] » Documents » Credit note* menu.
====

After creating a credit note order, a credit note has to be created directly in the credit note order. Check the items included in the credit note order and, when necessary, carry out changes before creating the credit note in the *Receipts* tab of the credit note order.

[.instruction]
Generating a credit note:

. Open the credit note order for which a credit note is to be created.
. Select the option *Credit note* from the drop-down list Create receipt.
. Click on *Create receipt*. +
→ The credit note order is created and opened in a separate tab.

Created credit notes show a reference to the invoice of the corresponding order. In the *Documents* tab of an order, this is shown in the naming of the credit note.

[#540]
=== Reversing and correcting a credit note

Once you have generated the credit note for a credit note order, the credit note order will be locked and can no longer be edited. The lock ensures that tax relevant information cannot be changed. If you discover an error in your credit note after the document was created and you wish to correct it, a *Reversal document refund* has to be generated.

[#543]
==== Setting up a reversal document template

First set up a template for the reversal document. The fastest way to fill all required settings is to apply the settings from the default document template. +
The following steps describe how to apply the settings from a default document template.

[.instruction]
Setting up a reversal document template:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Refund reversal*.
. Click on the *Transfer* tab.
. Click on *Accept* to *Apply the settings from default document template*.

Because the information in a reversal document is identical with the information included in an invoice, further information on the required settings can be found on the xref:orders:generating-invoices.adoc#[invoice] manual page.

[#547]
==== Correcting a credit note

Correct a credit note by generating a *refund reversal document* first. The reversal of a credit note allows you to make the required changes in the credit note order and a new credit note can be generated. Generating a reversal document does not cancel the credit note order itself.

[IMPORTANT]
.Correcting a credit note
====
The reversal of a credit note is used for a transparent correction of tax relevant data and *not* for the reversal of the credit note order itself.
====

[.instruction]
Correcting a credit note:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the order that contains the credit note you want to reverse.
. Click on the *Receipts* tab.
. Select the option *Refund reversal* from the *Create receipt* drop-down list. +
→ A new window with optional settings opens.

. Edit the data.
. Click on the *Receipts* tab.
. Select the option *Credit note* from the *Create receipt* drop-down list. +
→ A window with optional settings opens.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The reversal document is generated and the settings of the credit note order are locked again.

[#550]
=== Booking refunds

After creating a credit note, the refund of the credited amount has to be booked in your plentymarkets system. Refunds that are transferred via one of the payment providers you have integrated in your system are booked directly in the *Settings* tab of the credit note order. The *Refund to customer* option is only displayed for the payment methods *PayPal*, *ClickandBuy* and *heidelpay*.

[IMPORTANT]
.Requirements for PayPal
====
*PayPal* does not allow you to enter an amount higher than the amount paid for the original order.

Using this tab for booking a refund is necessary when the original order has not been paid with a payment provider integrated in your plentymarkets system.

[.instruction]
Booking a refund in the *Payment* tab:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the credit note for which you want to book a refund.
. Open the *Payment* tab.
. Click on the icon *Book payment*.

== Working with warranties

Warranties are quite similar to xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#400[returns]. In both cases, the items of an order in *status 7* will be sent back to you. In contrast to a return, customers expect a new delivery or a refund in the form of a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#500[credit note].

[TIP]
.Guarantee vs. Warranty
====
In contrast to a guarantee voluntarily provided by the seller, the warranty represents the *legal obligation* of the seller to eliminate defects and damages that already existed when the item was delivered to the customer free of charge. Depending on the characteristics of the items and the legislation that applies, customers can have a right to claim a warranty up to 2 or 3 years after the purchase of the item. If damages appear more than 6 months after the receipt of the items, the customer has to prove that they already existed upon delivery.
====

If the conditions for a warranty apply, you can decide whether to refund the customer’s costs or to exchange the damaged item with a new one. Create a *warranty* to replace the damaged item. For refunding the customer, create a refund in the *Overview* tab of the warranty. Determine in the basic settings *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu whether the xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#intable-shipping-costs-in-warranty[shipping costs should be covered in the warranty].

[TIP]
.Warranty settings
====
If you create a warranty directly within an order, the *shipping profile* of the main order is automatically adopted. However, the settings can be changed in the warranty’s editing window. For *delivery orders*, the correct warehouse is automatically selected as well. The *payment method* for a warranty can be changed.
====

[#610]
=== Creating a warranty

In general, a warranty is created out of a return order. However, it is also possible to create it out of the original main order.

We recommend creating the warranty directly in the main order if the customer finds fault with the ordered items after delivery and you decide against proceeding with a return order.

If you wish to proceed with a return order to examine the damaged items, create a return order first and create the warranty in the return order.

[.instruction]
Creating a warranty:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the *return* or the original main *order* for which you want to create a warranty.
. Click on the *Warranty* drop-down list.
. Select an option according to the explanations given in <<table-options-warranty>>.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The warranty is created and opens in a new tab.

=== Editing a warranty

Existing warranties are displayed in the overview. Open the warranty to enter an additional *price* if you decide to replace the damaged item by providing the customer with a similar but more expensive one. The quantities of the items included in the warranty can be changed here as well. Proceed as described below to edit a warranty.

[#630]
=== Completing a warranty

In order to complete a warranty for which an additional charge is billed for the replacement, an invoice has to be created within the warranty. In case the customer agrees to a discount on the damaged item instead of proceeding with a return order, you have to create a credit note in the original main order.

Proceed as described below to complete a warranty by replacing items:

[.instruction]
Completing a warranty with a replacement:

. Click on the *Receipts* tab within the warranty.
. Select the option *Invoice* from the *Create receipt* drop-down list. +
→ A window for editing opens.
. Adjust the settings as needed.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The invoice is created and opened in a separate tab.
. Open the *Settings* tab.
. Click on the icon *Book outgoing items* in the column *Outgoing items.* +
→ The outgoing items are booked and the *status* automatically changes to *[7] Outgoing items booked.*
. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Change the status manually to *[10] warranty*.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Booking incoming payments for warranties
====
Generally, incoming payments for warranties only have to be booked it an additional charge has been negotiated with the customer. In this case, book the incoming payment after the customer has made it in the *Payment* tab of the warranty.
====

Proceed as described below to complete a warranty by creating a credit note order and the corresponding receipt.

[.instruction]
Completing a warranty with a credit note:

. Open the main order or the return order for which you want to create a credit note.
. Open the Overview tab.
. Click on the *Credit note* drop-down list and select *create*. +
→ The credit note order is created and opened in a separate window.

All further steps necessary to complete the credit note order are identical to the regular procedure for credit note orders. This is described in detail in the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#500[credit note] chapter on this manual page.

[#700]
== Working with repairs

In plentymarkets, repairs are represented by a separate order type. Repairs consist of returned items that need to be repaired. Thus, repairs can only be created from xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#400[returns].

[#710]
=== Creating statuses for repairs

Before using repairs you should set *statuses* for the different steps of the repair process in order to monitor the process in your plentymarkets system in detail. You can add statuses for several languages.

[#740]
=== Editing a repair

Depending on the reasons for return and the condition of the items that need repairing, different steps have to be carried out. +
Since repairs constitute a separate order type, you can use the *Overview* tab to proceed with a credit note, a warranty or a return order. The necessary steps for each of these order types such as creating the necessary documents, booking outgoing or incoming items or booking payments are identical to the order types xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#500[credit note], xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#600[warranty] and xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#400[return].

[#800]

=== Creating a multi-order per customer class

Example: A company may not want to receive an invoice every time one of their employees make a purchase in your online shop. Rather, the company prefers one monthly invoice for all of its employees’ purchases. Set up a customer class for this situation. The invoice recipient is specified by saving a customer ID in the customer class. The multi-invoice is generated directly within the corresponding multi-order and sent to this invoice recipient. +

Go to *Orders »Multi-orders* to create a multi-order for a specific customer class and a fixed time period. This way, all unpaid orders belonging to the customer class are combined in one multi-order. Use the option *Customer ID* in the customer class settings to determine a customer who is listed as the owner as well as as the recipient of the multi-invoice for a customer class. According to your workflow, we recommend creating specific xref:crm:preparatory-settings.adoc#create-customer-class[customer classes] for multi-orders.

[.instruction]
Creating a multi-order for a customer class:

. Go to *Orders » Multi-orders*.
. Open the submenu *Generate multi-orders*

== Working with advance orders

Advance orders are an important tool in the marketing mix for e-commerce. Often, items can be ordered at a reduced, introductory price before they actually become available. This represents an unusual case for stock management since items that are not available yet cannot be allocated to a warehouse.

Advance orders are very easily set up in plentymarkets. Just use the order type *advance order* for manually created orders.

To be able to receive advance orders via your online shop, you have to enter the release date and availability for the items. Carry out the item settings as described below.

[IMPORTANT]

You find the option *Release date* within the area for editing items, listed in the *Available* tab. Here, you can use the calendar to enter the date on which the item will become available. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Entering the release date

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item you want to offer in advance.
. Open the variation you want to offer in advance.
. Go to the *Settings* tab of the variation and scroll down to the section *Availability*.
. Enter the date on which the item is to be available in the field *Release date*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Next, make sure that this date will also be displayed to your customers. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Displaying the release date in the online shop:

. Go to the menu *CMS » Web design » Folder: Layout » Folder: ItemView*.
. Open the *ItemViewSingleItem* template.
. Insert the template variable *$ReleaseDate*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#1120]
=== Item availability

Another requirement is to correctly set the *Item availability*. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Setting up item availability for advance orders:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item you want to offer in advance.
. Open the *Settings* tab.
. Select *No limitation* for the *Limitation* option. +
→ The item can now be ordered and thus purchased, even without actually being in stock yet.

[TIP]
.Maximum order quantity
====
In order to prevent other online sellers from misusing your advance orders to completely buy out your item a reduced price, enter a value for the option *Maximum order quantity* in the *Available* tab. If you enter the value *1* there, the item can only be purchased once per order. If you set the maximum order quantity to *0*, the item will be sold without limitation.
====

[#1130]
=== Setting up a payment request for advance orders

Usually, the option *shipping date* is not used for ordinary orders. However, it can be helpful to use this option for advance orders. If the release date of an item is in the future, the release date will then be saved as the order’s shipping date since deliveries can only take place once the item is released. You can use the shipping date as a filter option in the order search and in the procedure manager.

Advance orders are usually generated some time before an item appears and are not paid for by the customers at the time when they are ordered. That’s why it is useful to inform your customers a few days in advance about the upcoming shipment and request payment from them. Use the procedure manager to automate this process. A few days before shipping takes place, the procedure manager will automatically send the customers a reminder email stating your bank details and providing a link to the checkout. Proceed as described below to set up the automatic payment request.

[.instruction]
Setting up a payment request via email:

. Create an xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[Email template].
. Go to *Setup » Orders » Procedures*.
. Open the New procedure tab.
. Enter a *name* in the *Settings* tab.
. Select a time from the drop-down list next to the option *Execute every day at*.
. Activate the option *Active* to activate the procedure.
. Click on the *Filter* tab.
. Set the *status* to *[3] Waiting for payment*.
. Select an option for *Shipped on*, e.g. *in 4 days*.
. Click on the *Procedure* tab.
. Select the previously created email template for the option *Send email template*. With this procedure, this template will automatically be sent to the customer.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the procedure.

[#1200]
== Using order statuses

The order statuses visualise the progress of orders during order processing. 19 statuses with 4 decimal places each, so a total of 199999, are available in your plentymarkets system. 28 statuses are set by default. These statuses represent a basis for usual steps of order processing. Some of these 28 statuses are linked to automatic processes in the system. You should only use them for these designated purposes within the system. The status of an order changes because of these automatic processes in the system, through automatic processes set up by you or can be changed manually. Order statuses also improve the order search.

Roughly go through your order processes and determine when you want to assign a different status to orders to depict the progress of your processing. Set up your statuses after this by entering names for them. But take into account the default statuses which are already set up for a specific purpose, mentioned in <<table-default-statuses>>.

[TIP]
.Pay attention to the user rights
======
Note that elements such as drop-down lists only display those *online stores* and *order statuses* for which the current user was given rights to. If you do not see a status, it is most likely that you do not have the rights needed for this. Rights can be assigned by admin users.
======

[#preselected-statuses]
=== Comprehending default order statuses

The following 28 status entries are available by default in your plentymarkets system and some of them are linked to automatic processes in the system. It is not possible to delete statuses that are linked to an automatic process.

[[table-default-statuses]]
.Default statuses and automatic processes within the system
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Order status |Explanation

| *[1]* Incomplete data
|This status is automatically assigned when the data of an order is incomplete, e.g. missing address details. Incomplete data can sometimes occur when they are imported from markets. Orders with this status are not to be processed further. The data will be completed by subsequent imports. The incomplete data are useful for a timely booking of stock.

| *[1.1]* Waiting for payment & activation

[#1300]
== Searching for orders

The search can either be used to compile all the orders or to find specific orders. A search is not automatically conducted as soon as the menu is opened. The filter for date is set by default to *Order received* and shows the received orders of the last 2 months. All other filter options are initially set to *ALL*. Adapt the filter settings to refine your search. Then conduct the search.

[.instruction]
Searching for orders:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Adapt the filter settings.
. Check, whether the standard setting of the option *Date* and the time period *from to* meet your requirements.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]) to have the corresponding orders listed.

For example, all orders which are not yet completed will be listed when you search for orders with a status smaller than (<) 7 (outgoing items are not booked yet) and do not set filter for date.

Click on *Reset* (icon:undo[role="orange"]) to reset your filter settings to the default values. Then click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]) again in order to reset the search result as well.

[TIP]
.Search results after changing the order status
====
When you change the order status of orders it can happen that these are not immediately listed in the search results. For example, the status is changed from 6.9 to 7 and when you then search for all orders with status 7 immediately after this, those recently changed might mot be listed. Because of the synchronisation in the background this could take a short time. Just repeat the search after some time to have all orders listed correctly.
====

[#1310]
=== Filtering by IDs and numbers

In order to filter by IDs or numbers, enter a value in the corresponding field. By entering a *Customer-ID* in the corresponding field, only orders of this customer will be shown, for example.

Or, for example, by entering the number 3 in the field *Order ID* only the order with the ID 3 will be displayed. Accordingly, it is an exact and not a fuzzy search . But it is possible to enter several IDs in the field Order ID and thus to search for several orders at once. Only separate the IDs by commas.

[TIP]
.Status search filter
====
If you are searching for numbers or IDs it makes sense not to narrow down the status but set it to *All*. Only those orders are displayed which fulfill all the set criteria. If you cannot find an order despite having entered the exact ID, you might have forgotten to set the filter for *Status* to *ALL*.
====

[#1320]
=== Filtering by customer data, item data or invoice numbers

Using the fields *Customer data* and *Item data* is recommended, when you are looking for a specific customer or item. You can either enter terms or numbers, both is allowed. Besides names, you can also enter postcodes but no telephone numbers, into the *Customer data* field. For a search with *Item data*, the fields item ID, item number as well as name are taken into account, but not the descriptive fields like short description, for example. A search for external invoice numbers is also possible when searching for *Invoice numbers*.

[TIP]
.Only shorten the end of search terms and numbers
====
Quite often it is sufficient to enter only the stem of the word when searching for customers or item data. Just bear in mind that search terms may be truncated almost freely at the end but not the beginning. For example, if you are searching for items with the term packages, you could also enter package or pack. However, searching for ackage would not yield any results. It is the same for all numbers, e.g. postcodes.
====

[#1330]
=== Filtering by order type

Use the filter *Type* to search for the following order types:

* Order
* Credit note order
* Multi credit note
* Return
* Warranty
* Offer
* Advance order
* Delivery order
* Repair
* Multi-order
* Orders, warranties, delivery orders and repairs
* Orders and delivery orders

It is searched only for the selected order type or combination thereof. The filter is set to *ALL* by default, meaning that it will be searched for all order types.

[#1340]
=== Filtering by date

Use the filter *Date* to search for orders that already passed through a specific step of the order processing during the period of time you selected. For this step you can either select *Orders received*, *Incoming payment* or *Outgoing items* in the filter *Date*. After this, choose the start date under *from* and the end date under *to*.
All orders which already went through the chosen step during the selected period of time are displayed. The filter is set by default to *Orders received* and the time period to the last 2 months.
If you do not want to search for orders within the last 2 months, set the required period of time as described above.

[#1350]
=== Filtering by flags

Irrespective of order statuses, you can also assign flags to orders. You can also search for orders by these flags. Flags could be assigned, for example, to problematic orders. This way, someone in charge has to clear them before shipping. This person can search for these orders e.g. once a day by using the filter *Flag*, add information and then reset the flag.

[#1360]
=== Filtering by documents

Use the filter *Document* to search for orders for which a specific xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[order document] has already been created. You can either search for a specific *document type* or for a document number.
You can also combine these two search criteria and search for an order for which a specific document type with a specific document number has been created. +
The search for *document type* results in an overview of those orders for which this document type has already been created. The search for specific *document numbers* yields more distinct results, i.e. specific documents and their corresponding orders.

[.instruction]
To search for all orders with a specific document, proceed as described:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Select a *document* from the drop-down list in the *Filter*.
. Take into account the *Date* filter, this is set to the last 2 months by default and might need adjustment.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ All orders, for which the chosen document type has already been generated, are displayed in the search results.

[.instruction]
To search for an order which contains a document with a specific number, proceed as described:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Select a *document* from the drop-down list in the *Filter* tab, e.g. *Delivery note*.
. Enter the number of the delivery note into the field *Number*.
. Take into account the *Date* filter, this is set to the last 2 months by default and might need adjustment.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ Only the order to which the delivery note belongs is displayed.

[TIP]
.Selecting a document type not obligatory when searching by number
====
The search for a document number also works when the standard setting for *Document* is not changed, i.e. when no document type is selected. However, if the numbers of different document types are identical, all orders including a document with this number are displayed. This can be the case, if you did not xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#1800[define number ranges], for example.
====

[#1370]
=== Filtering by coupon codes

Search for orders containing coupons by entering the *Coupon code* into the corresponding field. Additionally, you can choose between the options *ALL*, *Redeemed* and *Sold*. *ALL* is set by default. Select *Redeemed* if you only want to search for orders containing already redeemed coupons. When you select *Sold*, you are only searching for orders with which a coupon with integrated coupon codes was sold. Select *ALL* to search for orders containing both, sold and redeemed coupons. The filter only works when a coupon code is entered, even if it is set to *ALL*. In other words, you cannot use this filter to search for all orders containing coupons.

[#1400]
== Setting up the order overview

The following tools help you to easily keep track of and manage the search results. All of your orders are displayed in the menu *Orders » Edit orders*. Here you can see the most important information about each order. You are provided with information about the customer, the order status and the payment status. You can also tell which items are included in the order, whether the outgoing items were booked and whether an invoice was generated. In other words, you can easily keep track of the most important processes without having to open the order. Move the cursor over the icons to see tooltips with additional information. You can find a list of all the symbols with the corresponding explanantions in <<table-symbols-order-overview>>.

Click on an *icon* to open further areas within the order. For example, click on *Calculate stock* to check the current stock of the item or to reorder stock.
Additionally, you can specify how many orders are displayed per page in the order overview. The maximum amount of orders per page is 400, the lowest is 50. +
Use the arrows to switch between pages. You can also enter the required page number directly and press Enter.

Furthermore, use the order overview to change the *status*, the *shipping charges*, the *item data* or the *discount* if required. The information below shows you how to proceed by using the example of how to change the status.

[.instruction]
Changing the order status in the order overview:

. Click on Status. +
→ A drop-down list with all available statuses is displayed.
. Select the required status. +
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The status is updated.

[#1410]
=== Item list in the order overview

The item list is displayed by default in the order overview. Thus, the items included in an order and their most important parameters such as *name*, *size* and *price* are immediately available to you. However, the item list can also be hidden, either for individual or for all orders. To hide the item list of an individual order, use the arrow icon *close item list.* To hide the item list for all orders, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Hiding the item lists for all orders:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. In the *Filter* tab, select the setting *Do not show* for the option *Stock unit*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The item lists will close for all displayed orders.

[#1420]
=== Information and icons in the order overview

Depending on the order’s condition, different icons are displayed in the order overview.
The following table contains an overview of all possible information that could be displayed. Some icons also allow you to perform actions directly. Note, that only those icons are displayed that correspond with the state the order is in.

== Editing orders

In the menu *Orders » Edit orders*, your orders are listed in the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1400[order overview] as described in the last chapter. As also explained there, some editing options are already available in the overview in order to ensure quick access to often needed functions. In addition, the basic information of an order are accessible at a glance. +
The complete and comprehensive editing options are available when you click on the order ID of the order you want to edit. The selected order opens and the order settings, which are arranged in sub-tabs, are at your disposal. You can edit orders until the first document is created. After this, the order is locked due to legal requirements. +
The settings sub-tabs and their different functions and options are explained in the following subchapters.

[#1520]
=== Opening and editing an order

You open the menu for editing an order by clicking on the header of an order in the overview. The order opens in a new tab. As mentioned above, every order has several sub-tabs that contain data and information. The tabs are described on this page of the manual. Orders that are open can be identified by their *ID* in the tab's title.
Most of the order's tabs do not include a save icon. Settings made in these tabs are saved automatically, e.g. changing the flag or dunning level in the *Overview* tab. You can switch to a different tab or close the order and open it again without losing the changes. However, some tabs include a save icon, e.g. the *Settings* tab. Here, you can switch to a different tab without losing the changes. But you have to save all your changes before closing the order.

[IMPORTANT]
.Default settings for editing orders by variable users
====
In order for variable users to be able to open orders, go to the menu *Setup » Orders » Settings* and save xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#intable-default-status-return[default statuses] for *returns* and credit notes. No status is saved here as the default setting. Variable users also need to be given the xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#105[right] to edit orders. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts* in order to carry out the required settings.
====

[TIP]
.Restricted editing options for plentyPOS orders
====
The editing options for xref:pos:pos.adoc#[plentyPOS] orders are restricted to comply with legal requirements. Only a few settings are editable.
====

[#1530]
=== Tab: Overview

The most important order parameters are found in the *Overview* tab. At a glance, you get information about prices, shipping costs, VAT, status, etc.

[TIP]
.Tip: Changing values
====
You can recognise changeable values by a drop-down list or by the appearing *pencil* icon. Click on the pencil icon to edit the required parameters (e.g. image 16, the *Weight* entry in the top left corner).
====

[[table-options-tab-overview]]
.Options in the *Overview* tab of an order
[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Setting|Explanation

| *Order ID*
|ID of the order. The ID is automatically assigned and cannot be changed.

| *Customer ID*
|ID of the customer.

| *Checkout*
|Opens the order in the *My account* area of the online shop.

| *Input*
|The date the order was received, i.e. the date the order was created or imported into the system. The input date can be edited manually as long as no document exists for the order.

| *IP address*
|Displays the customer's IP address if required. +
Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client\] » Order process » Settings* to activate or deactivate the *Purchaser's IP address* option.

| *Flag*
|Assign a flag to an order, if required. Flags are used to categorise orders. This helps you e.g. to find orders with the search filter or to apply automatic functions to them with event procedures.

| *Dunning level*
|Various dunning levels are set here if a customer does not pay for the order. These dunning levels are used for automatic processes within the dunning procedure.

| *Estimated shipping*
|The date for estimated shipping is calculated based on the delivery date for a xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#[reorder]. In order for the estimated shipping date to be displayed, both the reorder and the item's delivery date have to be confirmed and the order has to be in *status 4*. +
*_Important_* The option <<#intable-shipped-on, Shipped on>> in the *Settings* tab has a different function.

| *Copy*
|Copies the order and creates a new order with a distinctive ID in a separate tab.

| *Delete*
|Deletes the order. You are asked to confirm your decision. +
The delete icon (icon:minus-square[role="red"]) is not displayed when: +
- Tax relevant documents were already generated for the order. +
- The user is not xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#105[authorised] to delete orders. +
- After outgoing items are booked. +
- A delivery order was created. +
- Child orders exist. +
Generally, orders should not be deleted. Errors can occur when orders are deleted because the orders are linked to items, shipping settings and other functions such as cancellations and returns. However, it is possible to delete newly created orders. If you want to delete an order that has child orders, the child orders have to be deleted first.

| [#intable-splitting-orders]*Split up*
|Splits the order. The behaviour during splitting depends on your xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#intable-behaviour-after-splitting[basic setting] for this. +
The standard behaviour is that 2 new orders are created when an order is split. The original order is deleted. The shipping costs are recalculated for the new orders. Before splitting the order you are asked how the order items are to be distributed. +
An order can be split when: +
- It is not locked, +
- outgoing items have not been booked yet, +
- no child orders have been created (e.g. returns, delivery orders) +
- no tax-relevant documents have been created and +
- no payments have been assigned to the order yet.+
If you selected the other option *Change of order status* , 2 new orders are created as well. But the original order remains and is assigned a new order status defined by you. With this setting, it is also allowed to split orders with a payment already assigned to it and for which tax-relevant documents (important: invoice as well as reversal document) have been created. The assigned payment as well as the documents remain with the original order and are not transferred to the split orders. +
If you want a different xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#intable-splitting-behaviour-shipping-costs[behaviour of shipping costs] than the standard described above, you can select a different setting in the basic settings for orders.

| *Return; Credit note; Warranty*

| *Edit*
|Allows you to edit the item data if required, e.g. item quantity, item details, prices, discounts and VAT rates.

| *Add*
|Use the integrated item search to add other items to the order as required.

| *Assign storage location*
|Assigns a storage location to the stock units. If more than one storage location is saved for an item, then the storage locations will be given priority based on their positions. If no storage location was saved, then the *standard storage location* will be assigned. +
The assignment of a storage location is especially important for pick lists and packing lists. +
_Tip_: You can also use xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedures] to assign storage locations to items.

| *Delete assignment*
|Deletes the current storage location assignment. Click on *Assign storage location* again (see above) to create a new assignment that is better suited to the current warehouse situation.

If the values were already saved in the xref:crm:edit-contact.adoc#details-individual-areas[customer data], they will be taken from there and automatically be displayed here. The customer data have priority. If nothing is saved in the customer data, the customer classes are checked. If values are defined in a xref:crm:preparatory-settings.adoc#create-customer-class[customer class], these are then transferred to the payment terms of the order. If no values are defined in either the customer data or the customer class, the payment terms fields of the order are left empty. +
On the order, the payment terms can manually be entered or updated. This can be done regardless of where they are taken from or of whether there are values preselected at all. +

[#1570]
=== Tab: Receipts

Create receipts in the *Receipts* tab, e.g. an order confirmation, a delivery note or an invoice.
Once you have created documents for an order you can no longer edit the input date of the order.
The documents are created with the help of xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[document templates]. Check the document templates to make sure that the settings are right before you create receipts. Check the templates also if you receive an error message.

[TIP]
.Tip: Copying document templates
====
If you want to create a xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#300[document template] quickly, then simply copy a previously configured document template and make changes to the template as needed.
====

The receipts are configured before they are created. You can specify different parameters for each receipt. For example, for an invoice, you can enter the date or decide whether the outgoing items should be booked when the invoice is created. Furthermore, you can decide whether the status of the corresponding order is changed as soon as the receipt is created.

*_Note_* that created documents cannot be deleted, only external documents. You cannot reverse the creation of a document. For some documents, for example invoices, credit notes or dunning letters, reversal documents can be created. This ensures the traceability and unalterability of invoice documents. +
However, it is possible to archive documents. Archiving documents enables you to create these documents again. To do so, click on *Archive* (terra:receipt_archive[]). The archived documents can be found in the *Archived documents* tab within the *Receipts* tab. Exempt from this are documents for which a reversal document has to be created, as mentioned above. Archiving documents cannot be reversed. Once a document is transferred to the archive tab, they cannot be moved back.

[#1620]
=== Tab: Reorder

Select the order items for a reorder in the *Reorder* tab (image 7). Choose whether a reorder is only created for this specific order or whether you want to create a reorder to which items can be added from other orders as well. +
In both cases, the items have to have the same supplier and warehouse. If this does not apply, a separate reorder will be generated for each supplier/warehouse combination.

A supplier has to be saved for every variation. Otherwise it is not possible to place a reorder.

[TIP]
.Tip: Editing order items in the main order
====
Order items can be added to or deleted from the main order. However, you can only delete order items from the main order if they are not included in the delivery orders. Thus, you can increase or reduce the item quantity included in the main order. However, you should only delete quantities that are not assigned. It is technically possible to delete order items that are already included in a delivery order, but you should avoid doing so.

[#1670]
=== Reversing and correcting an invoice

Create a reversal document if you or your customer notice an incorrect information on an invoice and you subsequently want to correct it. Create a new invoice after this.
Reversing an order makes it easy to follow up on changes because the old invoice, the reversal document for the invoice and the new invoice are all available. Use the order status *cancelled* if you want to cancel the entire order. Use the reversal document if you want to edit the order and want to correct some of the information. +
Note that an invoice can only be reversed if no dunning letter exists for the corresponding order. In this case, the dunning letter has to be reversed first. To do this, use the xref:orders:generating-dunning-letters.adoc#400[reversal dunning letter].

[#1680]
==== Setting up a reversal document template

Set up a template for the reversal document first. The fastest way to set up the template is to apply the settings from the default document template or to copy the settings from the invoice document template. +

Setting up the template:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Reversal document invoice*.
. Click on the *Transfer* tab.
. Click on *Accept* under *Apply the settings from default document template* (icon:gear[role="darkGrey", stack="long-arrow-right,darkGrey", stackPosition="lr"]).

Since the information in a reversal document is identical with the information included in an invoice, further information on the required settings can be found on the xref:orders:generating-invoices.adoc#[invoice] manual page.

==== Correcting an invoice:

You correct an invoice by reversing it. The reversal of an invoice is used for a transparent correction of relevant invoice data and not for the reversal of the order itself. Once the reversal document was created, the order settings are unlocked and can be edited and a new invoice can be created as well.

[.instruction]
Correcting an invoice:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the order of which you want to reverse the invoice.
. Click on the *Receipts* tab.
. Select the option *Reversal document* from the *Create receipt* drop-down list. +
→ A new window with optional settings opens.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The reversal document is generated and the settings unlocked.
. Edit the data you want to correct. +
→ For example, add a VAT number.
. Click on the *Receipts* tab.
. Select the option *Invoice* from the *Create receipt* drop-down list. +
→ A new window with optional settings opens.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The invoice is generated and the settings are locked.

=== Using group functions

You can use the *Group function* to carry out processes for several orders at the same time. This means that processes, such as a status change or an email service, will be applied to all selected orders. The group function is particularly recommended if you need to edit a large number of orders and it would be too time consuming to edit each one individually. Proceed as follows to process several orders at once with the group function.

[.instruction]
Applying the group function:

. Use the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1300[search] to search for the orders you want to process with the group function.
. Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) orders.
. Click on *Group function* above the order overview. +
→ The window *Group function* wit further settings opens.
. Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the group function you want to apply to the selected orders.
. If needed, set further settings for the group function.
. Click on *Anwenden* (terra:execute[]) above the group functions. +
→ The selected group function is applied to the selected orders.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Group orders*
| By using this group function you group the selected separate orders into one new order. The behaviour for grouping depends on your xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#intable-behaviour-after-grouping[basic setting] for this. The standard behaviour is that the original orders are deleted. Shipping costs are recalculated for the new order. Orders can be grouped when: +
- They are not locked, +
- outgoing items have not been booked yet, +
- no payments have been assigned to the order yet, +
- it has no tax-relevant documents, +
- they have the same plentyID, +
- they are of the same order type, +
- they have the same referrer, +
- they have the same owner, +
- they have the same  contact, +
- they have the same address, +
- they have the same payment method, +
- they have the same currency and exchange rate. +
If you selected the other option *Change of order status* , a new order is created by grouping as well. But the original orders remain and are assigned a new order status defined by you. With this setting, it is also allowed to group orders with payments already assigned to them and for which tax-relevant documents (important: invoice as well as reversal document) have been created. The assigned payments as well as the documents remain with the original orders and are not transferred to the split orders. +
Regardless of the chosen setting, shipping costs are recalculated for grouped orders and order notes are copied to the new order as well.

| *Email service*
| By using this group function you send an email to either customers or the warehouses of the selected orders. To do so, select a *Recipient*, a *Template* and optionally a *Flag* from the drop-down lists. Make sure that you have set up an xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[email template].

| *Change flag*
| By using this group function you change the flag of the selected orders. To do so, select the flag to be assigned to the orders from the drop-down list.

| *Change status*
| By using this group function you change the order status of the selected orders. To do so, select the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1200[order status] to be assigned to the orders from the drop-down list.

| *Change shipping profile*
| By using this group function you change the shipping profile of the selected orders. To do so, select the xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1000[shipping profile] to be assigned to the orders from the drop-down list. You can also set and activate (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) additional *Shipping costs*.

| *Change owner*
| By using this group function you change the owner of the selected orders. To do so, select the owner to be assigned to the orders from the drop-down list.

| *Book outgoing items*
| By using this group function you book the outgoing items for the selected orders. To do so, select the date and the time when the booking is to take place. As soon as the items are booked, the order status of those orders changes to *7 - Outgoing items booked*.

| *Set delivery date*
| By using this group function you set the delivery date for order items. Set the delivery date with the date picker.

| *Set shipping date*
| By using this group function you set the shipping date for an order. Use the date picker to set this date. You can find the date *Shipped on* in the *Settings* tab of the detail view of an order.

| *Newsletter*
| By using this group function you can add a newsletter to an order. This newsletter is then sent to the customers of these orders. Make sure that you've set up a xref:crm:sending-newsletters.adoc#[newsletter] beforehand.

| *Transmit to atriga (debt collection)*
| This group function is no longer usable.

| *Create leads*
| This group function is no longer usable.

| *Reverse outgoing items*
| By using this group function you can reverse the already booked outgoing items for the selected orders, e.g. for returns. Note that the order status also changes by reversing the booking.

| *Delete*
| By using this group function you delete the selected orders. Make sure to check whether the selected orders should and can really be deleted. Generally, orders should not be deleted. Errors can occur when orders are deleted because the orders are linked to items, shipping settings and other functions such as cancellations and returns. However, it is possible to delete newly created orders. The following points prevent deletion of orders:  +
- Tax relevant documents were already generated for the order. +
- The user is not authorised to delete orders. +
- After outgoing items are booked. +
- A delivery order was created. +
- Child orders exist. Before a main order with child orders can be deleted, the child orders have to be deleted first.

[IMPORTANT]
.Applying group functions
====
Always make sure that you've selected the right orders before applying any of the group functions. Also note that some of the changes to orders can affect the further order processing or that automatisms such as event procedures or processes could be triggered, e.g. an order status change.
====

[.discrete]
==== Examples

Below, you can find two examples how to work with group functions. Example A describes how to book outgoing items for several orders at once. Example B describes how to inform customers about the availability of an item.

[.instruction]
*Example A*: Booking outgoing items with a group function

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Select the *orders* for which you want to book outgoing items with a group function.
. Click on *Group function*.
. Select the option *Book outgoing items*.
. Select the *date* and the *time*. +
→ The current date and time are selected by default. However, both, date and time are adaptable. You are required to select a date and time to use this group function.
. Click on *Apply* (terra:execute[]) to carry out the procedure.

[TIP]
.Default settings for editing orders by variable users
====
In order for variable users to be able to open orders, go to the menu *Setup » Orders » Settings* and save xref:orders:basic-settings.adoc#200[default statuses] for *returns* and credit notes. There is no default status saved for *returns* and *credit notes*.
Variable users also need to be given the xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#105[right to edit orders]. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts* in order to carry out the required settings.
====

[.instruction]
*Example B*: Informing customers about item availability with a group function

*Initial situation*: A highly demanded item in your plentyShop is temporarily out of stock but you you already received quite a few orders for this particular item. Usually, there is nothing sellers can do about such delivery delays, but the customers have to be informed as soon as possible about the delay.

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Search (icon:search[role="blue"]) for the *orders* about which you want to send information to customers. +
→ Search with the help of the *Item ID* or the *Item name* all orders with the status *ALL < 7* because your process is only relevant for orders which have not outgoing items booked yet.
. Select the orders which are displayed after the search.
. Click on *Group function*.
. Select the option *Email service*.
. Select a *Recipient*, a *Template* and optionally a *Flag*. +
→ Make sure that you set up an xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[email template] first. That way you can now select it here for the group function.
. Click on *Apply* (terra:execute[]) to carry out the procedure. +
→ The email is sent to the customers.

[TIP]
.Status &gt;= 7
====
Note that an *order status &gt;= 7* cannot be set to a lower status without reversing the booking of outgoing items first. For orders with status 7 or higher, you first have to reverse the *outgoing items* by using a group function.

=== Check list for sales prices

Use this check list if you want to edit order items and encounter problems. In most cases this is because the details of the order don’t match the settings of the sales prices.

Therefore, check if the following settings in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu are selected for the respective price:

[%interactive]

* [ ] *1* is set for *Minimum quantity*.
* [ ] The *Currency* the order is in is activated for this price.
* [ ] No *Price type* is activated for this price, i.e. neither RRP, Special offer nor Set price is selected.
* [ ] The *Client* of the order is activated.
* [ ] The required *Customer class* is activated if it is set in the system.
* [ ] The *Country* where the order originated is activated.
* [ ] In the *Referrer* list, *Manuelle Eingabe* (manual input) is activated.
* [ ] The corresponding *Referrer* of the order is activated.

If you could place a check mark next to these options, you should be able to edit the order items. In case you are still encountering problems, you can find more detailed information about sales prices in the manual under xref:item:prices.adoc#[Sales prices and price calculation] or you can ask our supporters in the link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/[Forum].
