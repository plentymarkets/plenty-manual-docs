This manual page explains how to <<#create-new-template-from-scratch, create new template from scratch>> in the *Setup » Documents » DocumentBuilder* menu, and how to create a <<#copy-template, copy>> of an existing template, which you can then adjust to suit your needs. It also explains the various <<#adjusting-settings-for-template, settings>> that you need to adjust when you create a template.



[#create-new-template]
== Creating a new template from scratch

If you create a new template from scratch in DocumentBuilder, the new template will be empty of content. You will therefore need to structure it, fill it with content and configure it.

[.instruction]
Creating a new template from scratch:

. Open the *Setup » Documents » DocumentBuilder* menu.
. Click on Search (material:search[]) to list the existing templates.
. Click at the top on *New template* (material:add[]). +

<<#adjusting-settings-for-template, Adjusting the settings for a template>>.
. Create the structure and content for the template. Refer to the explanations on manual page xref:orders:documentbuilder-creating-template-structure.adoc[Designing the template using the editor].


[#copy-template]
== Copying a template 

All templates in DocumentBuilder can be copied. If you copy a template, the copy will have the same content and settings as the original. You can then adapt these as needed.

[.instruction]
Copying a template:

. Open the *Setup » Documents » DocumentBuilder* menu. +
→ The DocumentBuilder overview opens.
. Click on Search (material:search[]) to list the existing templates.
. Find the template you want to copy and click on its context menu (material:more_vert[]), which is located on the far right of the template row.
. Click on material:file_copy[]*Copy template*. +
→ The template is copied and directly opened. +
*_Note:_* Die neue Vorlage erhält denselben Namen mit dem Zusatz "Kopie" am Ende. Copies are disabled by default.

xref:orders:documentbuilder-creating-a-template.adoc#Adjusting-the-settings-for-a-template[Adjusting the settings for a template].
. Create the structure and content for the template. Refer to the explanations on manual page xref:orders:documentbuilder-creating-template-structure.adoc[Designing the template using the Editor].

[#adjusting the-settings-for-a-template]
== Adjusting the settings for a template

You adjust the settings for a DocumentBuilder template in the following three areas:

* The *template settings*, where you specify the document type and the names for the template.
* The *order settings*, where you specify the types of order that the template will be used for.
* The *output settings*, where you set the format specifications for a template.

You access these areas via the template view. When you create a template or open an existing template in the *Setup » Documents » DocumentBuilder* menu, you switch to the template view:

image::EN-orders-docbuilder-template-view-640-329.png[width=640, height=329]


* *Navigation*: Templates that you open in the overview appear here (material:description[]) ready for editing. The template currently selected for editing (highlighted in grey) is displayed in the main window on the right. Click on material:add[] *New template* in the navigation to create a new template. Click on material:menu[] to expand or collapse the navigation bar.

* *Toolbar*: Click on material:save[] to *save changes*, on material:delete[] to delete *the selected template*, on material:more_vert[] to *copy or export a template*, and on material:toggle_off[] to *activate or deactivate* a template. + 

* *Main window*: In the left-hand section of the main window, you see the template structure of the template currently selected. At the top of the template structure, you see three icons. Click on material:visibility[] for a *template preview* and on material:edit[], to open *the Editor*. +
Click on material:settings[] to open and adjust the *output settings*. +
The top right section of the main window is where you adjust the *template settings*. +
The bottom right section of the main window is where you adjust the *order settings*.

If you make changes to a deactivated template, the changes will be applied only to documents generated after the template is activated.
