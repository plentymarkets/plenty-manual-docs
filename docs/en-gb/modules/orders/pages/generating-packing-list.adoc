In plentymarkets, you can generate packing lists as PDF files. +
A packing list includes an overview of all order items included in the order. In addition, the order ID is displayed in the form of a barcode. This barcode can be scanned and thus allows outgoing items to be booked directly after the shipping process has been initiated.

== Displaying item data

Use the options *Show* or *Do not show* in the menu *Setup » Orders » Documents » Packing list* to determine which item data should be displayed on your packing lists, such as *Item ID*, *Quantity* or *Item image*. +

You can carry out individual settings for some of the fields described in <<table-options-packing-list>> concerning the parameters *width*, font size and font weight that allow you to individualise the layout of the packing list. Use the *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) to check the results of the settings while preparing the PDF template.

* Customer name and address
* Order ID
* Order date
* Item name and Quantity
* Shipping provider
* Payment method

== Generating a packing list

After having carried out the settings according to <<table-options-packing-list>> , you can determine which orders should be included in the packing list in the menu *Orders » Fulfillment*. In this menu, a *Search filter* allows you to select the orders and to determine how they are sorted on the packing list.

In order to generate a packing list, proceed as explained below.

[.instruction]

|Setting |Explanation

| *Order status*
|From the list, select the status of the orders that should be included in the packing list.

| *Owner*
|In the drop-down menu, select the owner for the orders for which the documents should be generated. Select *ALL* if documents should be generated.

| *Client (store)*
| *Standard* = only standard shop +
*ALL* = shop and clients

| *Warehouse*
|In the drop-down menu, select one warehouse or *ALL*.

| *Sorting*
|In the drop-down menu, select the method for sorting the items on the packing list. The options *Order ID*, *Invoice number* and *Item ID* are available for different sorting methods.

| *Limit*
|In the drop-down menu, select how many orders should be handled at a time. Set a value between 50 and 200. +
The maximum number of orders that can be handled at a time equals the maximum of orders that can be selected. If more than the maximum number of orders should be handled, repeat the process accordingly. The lower the chosen setting, the more efficient is the system performance.

| *Change order status* (Procedure)
|Select a status that should be applied to the orders after generating the packing list. +
The status change is an important tool to make sure that the process is not carried out twice for orders that have already been handled.

[WARNING]
====
The link *Change packing list* takes you to the settings in the menu *Setup » Orders » Documents » Packing list*, in which the document settings and the PDF template for the packing list are configured.

Warning: Whenever you carry out changes in this menu and save the settings, other users are logged out automatically and need to log in again. This ensures that the changes also apply to the other user profiles. Thus, make sure to inform other users before making any changes.
