== Setting up a document template for order confirmations

Further information and instructions on setting up the document template are available on the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[Order documents] page of the manual.

== Automating generating and sending order confirmations

You can set up event procedures to automate generating and sending order confirmations. This way, you don’t have to have an eye on incoming orders all the time and you don’t have to create each order confirmation manually but you can create an easier workflow by automating these events. As a first step, create an event procedure for generating the document. Then, create a second event procedure to send the generated order confirmation to your customers. To do so, proceed as follows.

:table-event-procedure: <<table-event-procedure-generate-order-confirmation>>
include:_includes:partial$event-procedure.adoc[]

[[table-event-procedure-generate-order-confirmation]]
.Setting up the event procedure "Generate order confirmation"
[cols="1,3,3"]
|====
|Setting |Option |Selection

| *Event*
| *Order generation  » New order*
|

| *Filter*
| *Order > Order type*
| *Order*

| *Action*
| *Documents » Generate order confirmation*
|If needed, activate the options *Payment due* or *Early payment discount* or enter a *comment* that will be displayed below the order items on the generated order confirmation. +
|====

If you want to send the order confirmation to your customers as a PDF attachment in an email directly after the generation, we recommend the event procedure described in <<table-event-procedure-send-order-confirmation>>.

[TIP]
.You don’t see the corresponding email template?
====
You don’t see the corresponding email template for the event procedure "Send order confirmation"? That’s probably because you haven’t created it yet. You can do this in the *Setup » Client » _Select client_ » Email » Templates* menu. Click on *New email template* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) and create the template according to your requirements. The name you enter here for the email template is then displayed in the event procedures. For further information about setting up email templates, refer to the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[Sending emails] page of the manual.
