[TIP]
.Guided tours available
====
The guided tours *Documentbuilder-Basic settings* and *DocumentBuilder-Editor* are available in the *Setup » Documents » DocumentBuilder* menu. The tours shows you the most important functions step by step. +
You can find the tours in the bottom left corner of the Setup » Documents » DocumentBuilder menu. Click on material:rocket_launch[] Guided tours to start the tour.

You need document templates to create documents that are tailored exactly to your needs? Then, the DocumentBuilder is the right tool for you. With the help of the DocumentBuilder in the menu *Setup » Documents » DocumentBuilder*, you can create your document templates in no time and manage them in one place. This means you have all your templates in one place and ready at any time. For some document types, standard templates are also available, which serve as a fallback if you have not yet created a template yourself and no other suitable template can be found for your document. +
On this page, learn how to search for already created templates or create new ones and find out how to adapt them to your needs.


[#preparatory-settings]
== Carrying out the preparatory settings

Before you start creating document templates, you should decide for which document types you want to use the DocumentBuilder. Also, set number ranges for your documents and ensure that all necessary permissions are in place.

[#activating-document-types]
=== Activating DocumentBuilder for document types

You can decide for which document types you want to use the DocumentBuilder and for which document types you still want to use the old settings menu under *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents* for the time being. Note, however, that the activation for the DocumentBuilder takes effect as soon as you have activated the toggle button. It is therefore not necessary to save this setting. However, you can just as easily switch back to the old UI by deactivating the toggle button. +
To select the document types for which you want to use DocumentBuilder, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Select document types:

. Open the *Setup » Documents » Settings* menu. +
→ The document settings overview opens.
. Activate (material:toggle_on[role=skyBlue]) the toggle button for the document types to be generated with the DocumentBuilder. +
→ The DocumentBuilder is now activated for the selected document types. +
*_Note:_* For all other document types, the old document settings are automatically used.
This does not apply to custom order documents as this is a new document type.

[#asynchronous-document-creation]
=== Asynchronous document creation

When you switch to DocumentBuilder, the new logic is also activated in the background and the documents are created asynchronously. The asynchronous logic allows you to continue using the plentysystem without having to wait until the document creation is complete. +

The following adjustments to the *Event procedures* and *Processes* are required: +

- *For event procedures*: Each document procedure must be created in *a single event* and not grouped into one. Existing event procedures with more than one document procedure should be splited. +
For example, if there is one event action for generating a document and sending this document by email, you should separate this event action in two. The e-mail is then only sent when the document is generated. +

- *For processes*: The creation of documents is triggered by the sub-procedures: *Print*, *Save* and *Generate*. +
You should use the *Generate* sub-procedure at the start of a process in order to be able to retrieve the documents later using the *Save* and *Print* sub-procedures.


[#defining-number-ranges]
=== Defining number ranges

Before you start generating documents, you should create number ranges in the *Setup » Documents » Number ranges* menu, so that the correct document number can be assigned directly to your documents. For more information, see the manual page xref:orders:defining-number-ranges.adoc[defining-number-ranges].

[#grant-user-rights]
=== Assigning rights for back end users

:rights-purpose: pass:quotes[can work with the DocumentBuilder]
:right-one: pass:quotes[*Documents > DocumentBuilder > Read*]
:right-two: pass:quotes[*Documents > DocumentBuilder > Update*]
:right-four: pass:quotes[*Documents > DocumentBuilder > Create*]
:right-five: pass:quotes[*Documents > DocumentBuilder > Delete*]

include::_includes:partial$rights.adoc[]

[#working-with-document-templates]
== Working with document templates

The DocumentBuilder overview provides all relevant information at a glance. Here you can see, for example, which template is currently activated and which template is used as default template. You can also (de)activate, copy, export or delete templates via the context menu (material:more_vert[] ) on the right.

[#use-default-templates]
=== Using default templates

Standard templates are available for the following document types: invoice, credit note, reminder, associated cancellation and correction documents and the delivery note. They can either be used directly to create a document or serve as a fallback if you have not yet created a template for this document type. +
In the system, there is a standard template for German (DE) and one for English (EN). +
Standard templates are also available as net or gross templates.

The standard templates are ideal for creating your first template, as they provide you with a base that you can then customize.
We recommend that you duplicate a standard template and then edit it in the *Editor* to your wishes.

[NOTE]
.Specifics of standard templates
====
Standard templates are configured to serve as a fallback if no other template of this document type exists, so they cannot be edited, deactivated or deleted.
====

[#configure-columns]
=== Configuring columns in the overview

In the overview, you can decide which columns should be displayed in the table and also define the order in which they are shown. In order to configure the columns, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Configuring columns:

. Open the *Setup » Documents » DocumentBuilder* menu.
. At the top right, click on *Configure columns* (material:settings[]). +
→ The window *Configure columns* opens.
. Select (material:done[]) the columns you want to be displayed. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-document-builder-columns>>.
. Move (material:drag_indicator[]) the columns via drag-and-drop to the desired position until they are displayed in the desired order.
. Add or remove columns according to your needs.
. Click on *Confirm*. +
→ The settings are saved.
