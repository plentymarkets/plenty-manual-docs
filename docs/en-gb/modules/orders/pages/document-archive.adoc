The *Data » Document archive (deprecated)* menu will not be developed any further. You can still see and use the function. However, no new features or extensions will be implemented. We recommend using the new *Data » Document archive* menu. For further information, refer to the xref:orders:document-archive-testphase.adoc#[Document archive] page.

In the document archive you can view single PDF documents that have already been generated, or you can generate a zip file that contains multiple PDF files. This archive contains PDF documents generated in your plentymarkets system during order processing, sales using the POS system or while managing stock.

The following document types are available in the document archive:

| *Date*
|Select a date range to search only for those documents that were generated during this time. As default, the current date is preselected ad the end date and the start date one day before.

== Exporting a multi-document as a ZIP file

. Go to *Data » Documents » Document archive*.
. Click on the Export tab.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-options-export-document-archive>>.
. Click on *Export* (icon:cog[]). +

[IMPORTANT]
.The export fails
====
A maximum of 6000 PDF can be zipped and exported. If your export fails, the reason may be that the number of PDFs exceeds the maximum of 6,000. Narrow the time range to reduce the number of documents. If you have narrowed the time range to the smallest one possible, which is one day, all documents for that day will be zipped and exported regardless of the maximum.

== Exporting coupons and vouchers

. Go to *Data » Documents » Document archive*.
