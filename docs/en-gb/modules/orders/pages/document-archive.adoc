[IMPORTANT]
.Important: No new features planned for this menu
====
The *Data » Document archive (deprecated)* menu will not be developed any further. You can still see and use this menu. However, no new features or extensions will be implemented. We recommend using the new *Data » Document archive (Test phase)* menu. For further information, refer to the xref:orders:document-archive-testphase.adoc#[Document archive (Test phase)] page.

In the document archive you can view single PDF documents that have already been generated or you can generate a zip file that contains multiple PDF files. This archive contains PDF documents generated in your plentymarkets system during order processing, sales using the POS system or while managing stock.

The following document types are available in the document archive:

== Searching for archived documents

You can search for PDF documents of a specific type and for a certain time range in the document archive. Documents are listed chronologically.

[.instruction]
Searching for PDF documents:

. Go to the *Data » Document archive* menu.
. Select the documents type from the drop-down list for which you want to search. Note the explanations given in table <<table-search-options-document-archive>>.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]).

[[table-search-options-document-archive]]
.Options in the *Search* tab
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Number*
|Allows you to search for a specific document. Enter the number of the document here to search for it. *Document*, *Date* and *Client (Store)* have to match the document as well.

| *Document*
|Select a document type to search only for documents of this type.

| *Date*
|Select a date range to look only for those documents that were generated during this time. As default, the current date is preselected as the end date and the start date is set one day before that.

| *Client (store)*
|Select either a specific *Client* or select *all*.

| *per page*
|Select how many search results are to be displayed on each page.
|====

[TIP]

== Exporting a multi-document as a ZIP file

You can download a large quantity of documents as a multi-document in a ZIP file. The documents you want to export can be limited by criteria such as document type, period and client.

[.instruction]
Exporting a multi-document:

. Go to the *Data » Document archive* menu.
. Click on the Export tab.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-options-export-document-archive>>.
. Click on Export (icon:cog[]). +
→ The ZIP file is exported.

[[table-options-export-document-archive]]
.Options in the *Export* tab
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Document*
|Select a document type to download documents of this type.

| *Client (store)*
|Select either a specific *Client* or select *all*.

| *Period*
|Select a date range to export only those documents that were generated during this time. The current date is set as start and end date by default.

| *Subfolder*
|Decide whether subfolders are to be created during the export. Select the option *with* in order to have subfolders created for each month in the ZIP file. By selecting the option *without*, no subfolders are created.

|====

[IMPORTANT]
.The export fails
====
A maximum of 6000 PDFs can be zipped and exported. If your export fails, the reason may be that the number of PDFs exceeds the maximum of 6,000. Narrow the time range to reduce the number of documents. If you have narrowed the time range to the smallest one possible, which is one day, all documents for that day will be zipped and exported regardless of the maximum.

== Exporting coupons and vouchers

Coupons and vouchers are an exception in the document archive because they are neither displayed by searching for them, nor when exporting multi-documents. Therefore, you have access to PDFs of coupons and vouchers in the separate *Voucher* tab in the *Data » Document archive* menu.

[.instruction]
Exporting coupons and vouchers:

. Go to the *Data » Document archive* menu.
. Click on the Voucher tab.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-options-archive-vouchers>>.
. Click on Export (icon:cog[]). +
