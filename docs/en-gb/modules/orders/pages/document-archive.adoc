:description: Learn how to find your archived order documents or POS documents in PDF format.


The *document archive* stores all documents generated during order processing, POS sales and stock management workflows in plentysystems. It also contains the *coupon archive*, which stores all coupons and vouchers generated by the system. + 

Use the document archive to view and export individual archived documents, and to generate and export ZIP files containing multiple archived documents. +
*_Note:_* The documents are exported in PDF format.

[#Document-archive-overview]
== Document archive overview

To access the *document archive*, open the *Data » Documents » Document archive* menu. The following document archive overview will appear:

image::EN-Documentarchive.png[width=640, height=218]

* *Navigation*: Use the navigation column to switch between the *document archive* and the *coupon archive*. The archive selected will appear in the main window on the right. +

* *Toolbar*: Use the document archive toolbar to ... +
** ...*configure the columns in the overview* (material:settings[]),
** ...*set, save and apply custom search filters* (material:bookmarks[]),
** ...*search for documents* (material:search[]),
** ...*export all search results as a ZIP file* (material:sim_card_download[]) +
(*_Note:_* To enable the material:sim_card_download[] button, you must first perform a _filtered_ search),
** ...*export multiple selected documents as a ZIP file* (material:file_download[] in the left section of tool bar) + 
(*_Note:_* To enable this function, you must first select multiple documents),
** *Merge selected documents* (material:post_add[]) + 
(*_Note:_* This function merges several documents and exports them as a single document. To enable it, you must first select multiple documents).


* *Main window*: This window displays either the *document archive overview* or the *coupon archive overview*, depending on what is currently selected in the navigation column. The main window also contains the following functions:+ 
** *Select all* (material:check_box_outline_blank[] in the top row): Use to select all search results on the page displayed. +
** *Select document* (material:check_box_outline_blank[] in an individual row) + 
** *Download document* (material:file_download[] in an individual row) + 
** *Delete document* (material:material:delete[] in der jeweiligen Dokumentenzeile) + 
*_Note:_* This function only appears for documents of the type *Reorder*. Documents of other types cannot be deleted from the archive.
** *Regenerate document* (material:restore_page[] in an individual row) + 
*_Note:_* This function only appears if the document failed to generate and was therefore assigned the status *Faulty*.
 
[NOTE]
.When do I use the "Regenerate document" function (material:restore_page[])?
====
Very occasionally, system lags cause the document generation process to fail, in which case the affected document is assigned the status *Faulty*. In such an event, the system automatically triggers document regeneration, albeit with a time delay. You can accelerate this process in the document archive by clicking on material:restore_page[] for the affected document. 

If manual regeneration fails, there is likely a problem in the settings. In this case, please contact the plentysystems support.
