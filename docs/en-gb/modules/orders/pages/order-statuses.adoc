= Using the order status

:author: team-order-core

The order statuses visualise the progress of orders during order processing. 19 statuses with 4 decimal places each, so a total of 199999, are available in your plentymarkets system. 28 statuses are set by default. These statuses represent a basis for usual steps of order processing. Some of these 28 statuses are linked to automatic processes in the system. You should only use them for these designated purposes within the system. The status of an order changes because of these automatic processes in the system, through automatic processes set up by you or can be changed manually. Order statuses also improve the order search.

Roughly go through your order processes and determine when you want to assign a different status to orders to depict the progress of your processing. Set up your statuses after this by entering names for them. But take into account the default statuses which are already set up for a specific purpose, mentioned in <<table-default-statuses>>.

[TIP]
.Pay attention to the user rights
======
Note that elements such as drop-down lists only display those *shops* and *order statuses* for which the current user was given rights to. If you do not see a status, it is most likely that you do not have the rights needed for this. Rights can be assigned by admin users.

|Status |Explanation

| *[1]* Incomplete data

[#add-and-edit-statuses]
== Adding and editing a status

In the *Setup » Orders » Status* menu, you can add your own statuses in addition to those listed in <<table-default-statuses>>. You can edit and e.g. rename the available status. Maintain statuses in different languages in order to inform your customers about the progress via email or in the customer account of the online shop. Apart from status related to system automatisms you are able to delete all status. Status related to system automatisms can be renamed. However you should make sure to not misuse the status related to system automatisms. +
Additionally, you can decide how the order statuses are displayed in your plentymarkets system. Use the toggle *Show status ID in status name* to decide whether only the given status name or whether the status ID is displayed additionally.

[TIP]
.Name is not a mandatory field
======
The name is not a mandatory field. If you don’t create a name you will only see a list of apparently empty status in the filters and an empty status field in the order overview. Therefore you have to enter e.g. at least the status number also as name in the language you use the most often, German or English. Translations in other languages do only serve as the user interface in the customer account of your shop and as customer information via email.====
======

.Decimal places
======
When assigning numbers to new statuses, make sure that they do not end with 0. If the last decimal place is a 0, the system automatically deletes it. Thus, plentymarkets makes no distinction between a status with the number 1.1 and a status with the number 1.10.
