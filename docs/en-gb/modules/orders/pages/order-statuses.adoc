:description: Learn how to use, create, edit and delete order statuses correctly. The purpose of order statuses is to visualise the progress of orders during oder processing.

The order statuses visualise the progress of orders during order processing. 19 statuses with 4 decimal places each, so a total of 199999, are available in your plentymarkets system. 28 statuses are set by default. These statuses represent a basis for usual steps of order processing. Some of these 28 statuses are linked to automatic processes in the system. You should only use them for these designated purposes within the system. The status of an order changes because of these automatic processes in the system, through automatic processes set up by you or can be changed manually. Order statuses also improve the order search.

Roughly go through your order processes and determine when you want to assign a different status to orders to depict the progress of your processing. Set up your statuses after this by entering names for them. But take into account the default statuses which are already set up for a specific purpose, mentioned in <<table-default-statuses>>.

[TIP]
.Pay attention to the user rights
======
Note that elements such as drop-down lists only display those *online stores* and *order statuses* for which the current user was given rights to. If you do not see a status, it is most likely that you do not have the rights needed for this. Rights can be assigned by admin users.
