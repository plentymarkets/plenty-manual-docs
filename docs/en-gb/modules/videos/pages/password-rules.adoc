Know someone who still uses the same password they thought up in 5th grade? Or a password that's only 3 characters long? It's probably not something you want your own employees to do. That's why plentymarkets has added a new feature to keep your system secure. Now it's possible to make sure your employees use passwords that meet your company's very own security standards.

By default, plentymarkets requires users to create passwords that are at least 8 characters long and contain a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters. But what if you want even stricter password rules? What if your company requires employees to change their passwords regularly?

No problem! Admin users can enforce their own, customised password security rules in the menu *System » Settings » User »Security*. Alternatively, just use the search function to find the menu.
Start out by telling plentymarkets how many characters your employees' passwords should be at minimum. Then tell plentymarkets which types of characters the passwords should include.

So for example, upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters. If you check all four boxes, then you can decide whether your employees' passwords should fulfill all four of the criteria or just any three of them.

If you want to make sure your employees change their passwords regularly, then just specify how many days the password should be valid.

And since users shouldn't simply rotate through the same two or three passwords, use this option here to tell plentymarkets how many old ones should be blocked. For example, if you enter 4, then employees will not be able to re-use any of their last four passwords.

Once you're happy with all the settings, activate your new password security standard and save the changes. Now when users change their passwords, they'll see guidelines indicating the minimum password length and types of characters that need to be used.

So take control of which security standards your business relies on and rest assured that every user password makes the grade.
