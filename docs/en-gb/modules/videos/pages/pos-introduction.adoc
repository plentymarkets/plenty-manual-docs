Take a walk downtown and you'll find three sellers who are as different as can be.
Hayden runs a one-man start-up and has been successful selling his beard care products online. But now he'd like to expand and open his doors to walk-in customers too. A brick and mortar store is just what he needs!

A few blocks away, you'll find Miss Dorothy.
Her corner store has been in business for 37 years. From her shop windows, she's seen the neighbourhood grow up and change. Now Miss Dorothy is ready for a little change too. She'd like to begin selling her socks and jam on that new-fangled thing called the internet.

Head on over to High Street and you'll meet Arthur Buck, the shrewd businessman behind a popular chain store. Thousands of shoppers visit Arty's Athletics every day. And his online store has really taken off too! There's just one problem. His online store runs on one software, while his brick and mortar store is powered by another. Arty's having trouble managing it all, and he'd love to find a system that can bridge the gap between the real world and the virtual one.

So what do a trendy online start-up, a local mom 'n pop store and a huge athletics chain have in common?
All three sellers can take their businesses to the next level with the plentymarkets point of sale system!
