Welcome to plentymarkets e-learning. In this video tutorial I'd like to show you how to use roles to better manage your user accounts. Roles make it possible to divide users into groups and assign them specific rights. These rights may include access to certain menus in plentymarkets as well as the information that these users can see, such as orders or order statuses.

Roles can also be assigned to work processes. In doing so, processes can be made available to several users at the same time. In short, roles make it possible to assign rights across all user accounts. I can either open a user account and give this user specific rights or I can simply assign the user a certain role and the user rights are assigned automatically.

Alright, so how do I create a role? To do so, I have opened the menu *Settings » Basic settings » User » Roles*. I simply click the green plus icon and enter a name into the text field. I'd like to create a role with specific rights for my purchasing department. It is best to choose a relatively self-explanatory name for the sake of clarity. In this example, I'll enter 'Purchasing' and then click save. Now I switch to the 'User' tab and choose all of the users that should be assigned this role. To add a user to a role, I select their name and click on the single arrow pointing to the right or simply drag and drop their name into the righthand box. To add all users to the role, I click on the double arrow. To remove users from the role, I logically take the opposite steps.

In the *Rights* tab, I can define what users with this role are able to see, so the visibility, and I can also define what menus users with this role can access. The *Rights* tab is divided into the three sub-tabs *Visibility*, *Menu* and *API*. You may have noticed that these are the same settings that are also found in the individual user accounts.

Okay, let's take a look at the *Visibility* tab. The top section allows me to define which warehouse users with this role have access to. As I've mentioned, I am currently setting up the rights for my purchasing department so I will leave the selection *All* as is. But if I wanted to, I could specify a warehouse.

Next I want to assign rights for the visible order statuses. I can either select alI, or I can restrict which statuses users of this role can see by simply checking the specific box or boxes that I want to be visible. When I scroll down further, I reach 'Selectable order status'. 'Selectable' means that users with this role are able to assign this status to an order. Users cannot assign orders to a status that wasn't specifically selected. If I have more than one client (store), I can also specify which user role can access which specific client (store).


Next, I can select the ticket statuses users with this role can see. When I select visible, it means that the purchasing department can see all tickets of the selected status. *Invisible* means that users with this role can not see the selected tickets and 'Own only' means that these users can only see the tickets that they themselves are responsible for and that have the specified status.

This area is only visible because we at plenty market use the ticket system. For our purposes here, I am going to select invisible for all ticket statuses. The last area is called "Visible key figures". These are the different areas that the user should be able to see if he or she is working with the plentymarkets app. In this example, my user does not access plentymarkets with the app, so I will leave these settings blank.


Okay, so let's switch to the Menu tab. Here I specify which menus are visible to purchasing. The menu structure here corresponds to the main menu that is shown in the blue bar at the top of my system. Clicking on the 'plus' symbol in front of a menu item displays the sub-menus that it contains. Now I can select and manage which menus the purchasing department can access.

Purchasing needs access to Items and Stock in particular. I deliberately don't allow users of the purchasing role to delete items. The API tab is only relevant if I am using a SOAP API. That is why I won't go into any detail about it here in this video tutorial. As a last step, I save my settings.

When I click this icon, the role I have just created is copied - which means that all of my settings are copied - and this will save some time when I create a similar role. Clicking the e-mail icon opens up my e-mail software and I can send an e-mail to all users of this role. Obviously, e-mail addresses have to be saved for the user accounts within this role in order for this function to work.
Okay, now that I've finished creating my purchasing user role, I want to create a special right for a particular user within the department. Users with the purchasing role can not delete items. However, I want the head of the purchasing department to be able to do so. To specify this setting, I open the 'Accounts' menu right above 'Roles' here on the left. I select the respective user account and open the 'Right' tab and underneath it the 'Menu' tab. I can then check the 'Delete items' box. Now the head of department has all of the rights of the purchasing role plus the right to delete items. That is because the rights specified in the roles and the user accounts complement each other.

Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoyed learning how to create user roles in plentymarkets.
