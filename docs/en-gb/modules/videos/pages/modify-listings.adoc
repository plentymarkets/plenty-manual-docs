So far in this video course, you've learned how to create and edit one listing at a time.

That's kind of helpful. But in real-life, you probably have lots of listings that need your attention all at once.

No problem! plentymarkets makes it easy to apply settings to several listings at the same time.

Essentially, you've got a few different options.

If you've already created a bunch of listings in plentymarkets and now you want to change a few specific ones, then I'd recommend using the so-called "group function".

This is a way to tell plentymarkets, hey, for these three specific listings, use a different setting.

On the other hand, if you've already created a bunch of listings in plentymarkets and now you want to change all of the listings that meet specific filter criteria, then I'd recommend using so-called "batch processing".

Here you can tell plentymarkets, for example, that you want to edit all the listings that have a specific flag and are listed on eBay UK within a specific category.

Again, you tell plentymarkets, for all the listings that meet these criteria, use a different setting.

Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to mention templates.

The basic idea is simple. Instead of filling out the settings for every single listing individually create a template for all your run-of-the mill listing settings.

Templates are sort of like stencils, moulds or cookie cutters.

You can think of them as a pre-set pattern, which helps you create lots of similar listings.

Once the basic shape is in place, you can still tweak individual settings to make each listing unique.

In plentymarkets, simply enter whatever settings you want the template to control.

At first glance, it may seem like this menu contains a lot of listing settings that you've never seen before. But appearances can be deceiving!

If you take a closer look, you'll notice that these settings, for example, are the same ones you encountered when creating a new listing and these settings are the same ones that you configured in the listing's "base" tab.

Just one last word to the wise: If you're ever having trouble finding a particular setting, you can always search for it directly within your browser.

Once you've finished configuring all the settings you want to use in your template, click on the green plus icon, give your template a name, and save the settings.

From here it's easy to create a second template with similar settings.

Perhaps for a different target platform or for a different product line. Once you've set up your templates, you're ready to start applying them to items and listings.

Simply click on the "Multi-Channel" tab to link a listing template to a specific item.

Here you'll also notice that you can save eBay category IDs directly within an item data record. So if you'd prefer, then you can create templates that work for all different categories, and then just specify the category ID here.

When creating a new listing, you can also select a template here to use its settings.

Templates can also be used to change the settings of already existing listings.

This is how you apply a template to one individual listing.

And this is how you apply a template to several different listings that you hand-picked yourself.

Finally, this is how you apply a template to several different listings that meet specific filter criteria.

Now that you understand the basic concept, let's see it in an example.

Suppose I've just added several new products to my portfolio and now I want to create eBay listings for all these items.

If you don't already have a listing template, then your first stop will be here, where you'll fill out the settings and save the template.

Your second stop will be the item overview, where you'll find all of the new items that need your attention.

Here you'll click on the "Item group function" and link the listing template to these items.

Finally, open up the group function again and create listings for these items.

When you open up the listing overview, you'll see all of your newly created listings.

In this video, you learned how to modify several listings at once. You saw how to use batch processing and the group function. And you learned the difference between the two. You also learned how to create templates and use them like cookie cutters to give your listings a pre-set configuration. And you saw a practical example, which taught you how to quickly create listings for several new products at once.
