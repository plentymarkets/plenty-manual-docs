When you delete a plugin, all <<plugins/configuring-installed-plugins#local-vs-global-configuration, local configurations>> and <<plugins/configuring-installed-plugins#container-links, container links>> are deleted. To keep a backup of a local configuration, <<plugins/configuring-installed-plugins, export the configuration>>. Itâ€™s not possible to create a backup of container links.
