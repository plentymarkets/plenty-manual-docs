.Plugin position
====
A pluginâ€™s relative position determines the order in which plugins of the plugin set are loaded. The rule is that  Plugins with a lower position are loaded earlier. Normally, you want to set the IO plugin to the highest position and the plentyShop LTS plugin to the second highest. Theme plugins are an exception. They should be positioned in-between plentyShop LTS and IO.
