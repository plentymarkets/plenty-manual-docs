.Backup
====
If you want to edit your plugin set, create a backup copy first.
Using a backup copy has the following advantages:

* If the changes cause any problems, your online shop isn't affected.
This means you can first check your pages in a preview and publish them afterwards.
* It's easy to discard changes.

To create a copy of a plugin set, open the *Plugins Â» Plugin set overview* menu. Then, click in the *Actions* column on the *Copy plugin set* button (icon:clipboard[role=yellow]).
