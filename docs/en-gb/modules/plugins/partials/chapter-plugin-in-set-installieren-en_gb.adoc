= Installing a plugin in a plugin set

The whole plugin installation process includes three steps. First, you have to install the plugin in a plugin set. That’s when the plugin files are transferred to your system. In the second step, you activate the plugin. By activating a plugin, you indicate that you want to include it when your system or online store is loaded. Finally, you deploy the plugin set with all its active plugins. By deploying the set, you finish the installation process.
