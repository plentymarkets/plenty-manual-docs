[.collapseBox]
.Do plugins that are relevant for different clients have to be installed in multiple plugin sets? 
--
This depends on the kind of plugin. Plugins that communicate with routes via REST-API (f.e. PayPal, DHL) always have to be installed in the plugin set of the default client, because this client makes the REST-API calls. +

If you want to use this plugin additionally in another client, you have to install the plugin in the plugin set of the respective client, if you don't, you can't use it in the online shop. +

Market places and plugins that enhance the back end only have to be installed in the default client. If the plugin enhances the back end, you have to link the backend plugin set with the system. +

Usually, you will find all information about the installation of the plugin within the user guide of the plugin.  +
