[.collapseBox]
.I've purchased a plugin on plentyMarketplace, but it doesn't appear in my list of uninstalled plugins. Where can I find it?

plentymarkets uses a cache for purchased plugins. If you've purchased a plugin and it doesn't appear in the list of plugins yet, wait a few minutes. The list of plugins is updated every 5{nbsp}minutes.

.I get an error message when I try to add a Git repository to my system. What can I do?
--
First, check your login details and ensure that the branch you entered really exists. If the error still occurs, your plugin JSON may be invalid. plentymarkets checks the plugin JSON when adding repositories to the system. Compare your plugin JSON with the requirements specified in our link:https://developers.plentymarkets.com/dev-doc/plugin-information[developer documentation^].

.Why does my plugin not work?

[.collapseBox]
.I've deployed the plugin set, but there's no deployed version displayed. What's the problem?
--
There may be multiple causes. First, it's possible that deployment failed. You can see if the deployment process was successful by checking the timestamp in the plugin overview:

[.collapseBox]
.The deployment has failed and the details say "Plugin MyPlugin requires xy.:" What does this mean?
--
This entry means the plugin requires another plugin called _xy_ to run properly. You have to install this second plugin in your plugin set before you can deploy _MyPlugin_.
--

[.collapseBox]
.There's neither a timestamp nor an error message. What do I do now?
--
Confirm that your DNS settings are correct and you have a valid SSL certificate.
