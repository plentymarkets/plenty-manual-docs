There are multiple ways of adding plugins to your plentymarkets system. Using the <<integrations-assistant, Integrations assistant>>, you can set up your online store quick and easy. You can purchase plugins on <<marketplace-plugins, plentyMarketplace>>, some for free, others for additional costs. If you need a custom plugin designed to satisfy your particular needs, you can <<git-plugins, add it via Git>>.

== Integrations assistant

A new plentymarkets system does not come with any plugins pre-installed. If you want to run your own online store or set up a connection to the store systems Shopify or WooCommerce, you can use the *Integrations assistant* to select and install the most important plugins in one go.

The following plugins are available via the assistant:

* Online stores
** plentyShop LTS & IO +
→ These plugins form the basis of your own plenty online store.
** Shopify
** WooCommerce
* Payment methods
** PayPal
** Mollie
** Cash in advance
** Cash on delivery
** Invoice
** EBICS
* Shipping service providers
** DHL (DE)
** Hermes (DE)
** DPD (DE)
** DPD (UK)

NOTE: If you select the plugins via the assistant, the installation process does not include any more steps and you can continue with <<plugins/configuring-installed-plugins#, configuring the plugins>>.

.No review by plentymarkets
====
When a provider upload a plugin on plentyMarketplace, it's reviewed by plentymarkets employees. For plugins that aren't distributed via plentyMarketplace, there's no such review. This means that in these cases, plentymarkets cannot check the functionality of the plugin.

If you want to add a third-party plugin from a source other than plentyMarketplace to your system, we recommend that you cover any data protection concerns you may have and thoroughly test the plugin's functionality.

[#access-token-private-repositories]
=== Creating access tokens for private repositories

For private repositories, you need a personal access token in addition to the repository URL. How to create the token varies slightly from site to site. This page only describes how to generate a personal access token on GitHub and Bitbucket. If you use a different site, refer to the documentation of the provider for more information.
