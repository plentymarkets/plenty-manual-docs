The *CRM » EmailBuilder* menu is structured as follows:

image::crm:emailbuilder-overview-menu-structure.png[width=640, height=360]

* Folder and template structure: Here you can navigate through the different xref:crm:emailbuilder-work-with-emailbuilder.adoc#manage-folders[folders] and xref:crm:emailbuilder-work-with-emailbuilder.adoc#manage-templates[templates] that you created in the EmailBuilder. The *Default templates* folder is available in your system by default. You can of course adjust the pre-filled template content. The currently selected template (blue background) is displayed in the main window on the right. 

** *Search field*: Enter the ID or the name of the template into the search field.
** *Filter area*: In addition to the ID and the template name, you can also xref:crm:emailbuilder-work-with-emailbuilder.adoc#search-template[search] by type, language, client and owner here. Enter a combination of all or multiple values and options to narrow down the search results even further.
** *Sort by*: Under the search field, you can sort the folders and templates by ID, name or creation date in ascending or descending order.
** material:add[] *Add*: You can create a new folder, new template, new header, new footer or new text block here.

* *Main window*: Here you can see whichever template is currently open. Directly in the first line, you can see the tabs in the template’s corresponding languages.
** *Language settings*: In this area, you carry out the language-specific settings of the template. For example, you can link product data sheets or user manuals in the corresponding language with the template and determine the time, date and number formats and the number of decimal places for each language individually.
** *Content and subject*: Here you can customise the template’s content and subject. Use xref:crm:emailbuilder-variables-twig-expressions.adoc#[variables] that will be replaced with the correct content once the email is sent to your customers. +
You cannot use variables in the subject, but the so-called twig expressions associated with the variable. Click on material:integration_instructions[] (*Show variables*) at the end of the subject line to open the variable list. When you click on the desired variable, the corresponding twig expression including the double curly brackets will be inserted in the subject line.

* *General settings*: Here you can select the template name, owner, client as well as header and footer. In this area, you can also select up to 4 dynamic attachments and fill the fields *Reply to*, *CC* and *BCC*.

* *Toolbar*: Here you can save the changes of the opened template and see in which areas of your system the template has been used.
