=== Activating the new address layout for delivery notes

In order that the address layouts are automatically displayed on delivery notes, you have to carry out a setting in the xref:orders:generating-delivery-notes.adoc#[delivery note]. Your plentymarkets system automatically checks the country of delivery saved in the order and displays the delivery note in the layout listed in the *Setup » CRM » Address layout* menu. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Activating the new address layout for delivery notes:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Delivery note*.
. Select the option *New address layout* in the *Basic settings:{nbsp}Delivery note* area. +
→ The option above *Structure of the invoice/delivery address* is hidden and the delivery notes are displayed in the address layouts listed in the *Setup » CRM » Address layout* menu.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

*_Note:_* Currently, this setting is only available for delivery notes. This setting will follow for further documents.

[#create-customer-class]
== Creating a customer class

Use customer classes to categorise your customer base according to specific criteria. For example, you can create a customer class for consumers (B2C) that displays gross prices for the items in your plentyShop. Create another customer class for sellers (B2B) that displays net prices for the items in your plentyShop. Further options are discounts based on the net value of your items, discounts based on the payment method or discount scales for a selected customer class.

*_Note_*: If a contact registers in your plentyShop and selects the salutation *Company*, the customer class that you created for B2B contacts will apply automatically.

[TIP]
.Tip: Consider a concept for types and classes in advance
====
It is recommended to create a concept for organising your customer base into types and classes before saving customer data. By doing this, you will save time later on. For example, types and classes are automatically assigned when the initial configuration is missing. Decide which types and classes you need, create them and assign them to the contacts when upon creation.
====

You can create and individually configure as many customer classes as you like in the *Setup » CRM » Classes* menu. An ID is automatically assigned to customer classes. This ID is displayed to the left of the customer classes' name in the overview. However, customer classes are _not_ ordered by ID. Instead, the order is set using the option *Position*.

If you create a new customer class, this customer class is available in the detail view of the contact in the *CRM » Contacts (Test phase) » [Open contact]* menu.

[.instruction]
Creating a customer class:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.
. Click on the *New customer class* tab.
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-create-customer-class>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-create-customer-class]]
.Creating a customer class
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|[#intable-customer-class-minimum-order-value]*Minimum order value*
|Enter the minimum order quantity if you want to require customers to order a specific quantity of items or if you want to require them to order a minimum quantity to get a discount.

|[#intable-customer-class-name]*Name*
|Enter a name for the new customer class, e.g. *wholesaler* or *premium customer*.

|[#intable-customer-class-position]*Position*
|If you do not enter a position, the next available position number is assigned automatically. The position is primarily used to sort the customer classes in the menu. It is relevant e.g. in combination with the visibility of item prices in the plentyShop. This can be set under *Display of the prices in the online store*.

|[#intable-customer-class-terms-of-payment]*Payment due date, percentage for early payment discount, early payment discount and valuta*
|Payment due date, percentage for early payment discount, days for early payment discount and valuta are the terms of payment. +
*_Important:_* The terms of payment that are saved in the contact data record have priority over the values entered here. +
The terms of payment are saved in the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#intable-payment-terms-order[order settings]. The values in the contact data record have also priority over the values in the order settings. The values can be manually adjusted or entered in the order if no values are saved in the contact data record or in the customer class. The terms of payment saved in the order are then shown on the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#intable-payment-terms-documents[documents]. Note the example <<crm/companies#example-terms-of-payment, Terms of payment with valuta, payment due date, days for early payment discount and percentage for early payment discount>> on the xref:crm:companies.adoc#[Companies] manual page.

|[#intable-customer-class-contact-id]*Customer ID*
|Enter the ID of the contact who should receive the multi-invoices that are created from xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#800[multi-orders]. Multi-orders are generated for this customer class and the invoice is sent to that contact.

|[#intable-customer-class-discount-type]*Discount type*
|Select the discount type. The number of options that are visible depends on which discount type was selected. If you do no want to offer a discount, select the option *No discount*. Further information and explanations about the discount types in plentymarkets can be found in the <<#use-discount-system, Using the discount system>> chapter.

|[#intable-customer-class-volume-discount]*Volume discount*
|Select whether the value entered in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu under *Minimum quantity* should be taken into account or not.

|[#intable-customer-class-allowed-payment-methods]*Allowed payment methods*
|Select which of the payment methods that are available in the plentyShop should be permitted for this customer class. +
All of the available payment methods are selected by default. When you integrate new payment methods, you have to permit them here. This is because new payment methods are not automatically included in the list of allowed payment methods. +
*_Important:_* Pay attention to which xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1000[payment methods are blocked in the shipping profiles] that you want to use for this customer class. Check those settings to make sure that they are compatible with the settings you make here. If you want to permit a payment method for a customer class, you should make sure it is _not_ blocked in the shipping profiles. Make sure that the corresponding customer class is _not_ blocked either.

|[#intable-customer-class-payment-instruction]*Payment instruction*
|The payment instructions that are saved here are displayed on invoices. For example, you could enter payment information that relates to a specific customer class.

|[#intable-customer-class-display-online-shop]*Display of the prices in the online shop*
|Select whether *gross* or *net* prices are displayed in the online shop. +
*_Important:_* This option only sets how prices are displayed. It does not influence the way prices are calculated for the customer class. This option is particularly important for the customer class with position 1\. This customer class is automatically assigned to contacts if no customer class was selected in the contact data record.
|====

You can link sales prices with customer classes. Go to *Setup » Items » Sales prices* and select one of the customer classes that you created under the setting *Class*. For further information, refer to the xref:item:prices.adoc#100[Sales prices and price calculation] page.

[#create-type]
== Creating a type

Types are used to classify and differentiate contacts. Some types are available by default in your plentymarkets system and _cannot_ be deleted. These types are *Customer*, *Sales representative*, *Supplier*, *Partners*, *Manufacturer* and *Interested party*. The types that you created are available in the *Type* drop-down list in the *CRM » Contacts (Test phase)* menu.

When creating a new contact data record, the type *Customer* is automatically set by default. Customers who were assigned to the type *Supplier* are available in certain drop-down lists, e.g. in a variation's *Supplier* tab.

Proceed as described below to create types.

[#use-discount-system]
== Using the discount system (optional)

[TIP]
.Setting up the discount system is optional
====
Setting up the discount system in plentymarkets is optional. Read over the discount options in the following sub-chapters and then decide whether you want to allow discounts, for example via the customer classes.
====

In plentymarkets, you have various possibilities for offering discounts. You may give your customers a <<#customer-class-discount, customer class discount>>, a <<#discount-payment-method, discount based on the method of payment>> or a <<#discount-scale-net-value-of-items, discount scale based on the net value of items>>. Furthermore, you can save <<#discount-sales-price, sales prices as discounts>> and enter <<#discount-manually, manual discounts>>. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes* to carry out the settings for the types of discounts. The following sub-chapters describe which settings you need to carry out in order to give discounts.

[#customer-class-discount]
=== Setting up a customer class discount

In a customer class, you can determine discounts that are only effective for this customer class. Furthermore, you have further configuration possibilities, such as activating the sales price's volume discount. Make sure that the discounts can be added for each configuration.

Proceed as described below to save a discount for customer classes.

[.instruction]
Setting up a customer class discount:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.

. Enter payment instructions. +
→ These payment instructions are displayed on invoices.
. Select whether the prices in the online shop should be shown in *gross* (including VAT) or *net* (excluding VAT).
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#discount-scale-net-value-of-items]
=== Setting up a discount scale based on the net value of items

Would you like to reward your contacts with discounts when they regularly make large purchases in your plentyShop? If so, determine amounts that should be discounted based on the net value of items in the order.

[.instruction]
Setting up a discount scale based on the net value of items:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.
. Expand the customer class that the discount scale should be applied to (icon:plus-square-o[]).
. Select the option *Discount scale based on net value of items* as *Discount type*. +
→ A table with further settings opens.
. Enter monetary amounts under the words *Minimum net value of items* in an ascending order.
. Under *Discount in %*, enter the percentage that you would like to have deducted in ascending order. +
→ If you enter 50, e.g. in the field *Minimum net value of items* and 2 in the field *Discount in %*, a 2% discount is offered for orders totalling £50 or more.
. Select whether the *Volume discount* should be taken into consideration.

[discrete]
==== How do your customers see the discount in your plentyShop?

The discount is calculated and displayed once the customer has finished putting items into their shopping cart and has gone to the checkout. Initially, only the total discount is displayed in the shopping cart. When the customer completes the order and clicks on Go to cashier, the discount is calculated for the individual variations in addition to the total discount and displayed accordingly.

[#discount-payment-method]
=== Setting up a discount based on the method of payment

With the discount type *Discount based on the method of payment* you offer customers a discount if they use one or more payment methods.

[TIP]
.Directly saving a discount based on the method of payment
====
Instead of configuring the settings in this menu, it is also possible to directly save a global discount for a payment method. An example is a discount in percent for the payment method *Cash in advance*. For further information, refer to the xref:payment:managing-payment-methods.adoc#20[Managing payment methods] page of the manual. You are not able to completely customise the settings if you save a discount directly for a payment method. It is only possible to completely customise the settings when using the option *Discount based on the method of payment* in the *Setup » CRM » Customer classes* menu.
====

Proceed as described below to set up a discount based on one or more payment methods.

[#discount-sales-price]
=== Saving sales prices as discounts

A volume-related discount is created as own price in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu. Using the option *Minimum quantity* in the *Settings* area, you specify for the sales price from which item quantity the discounted price should be valid. You can realise graduated prices by creating multiple sales prices accordingly and entering the desired minimum quantities.

The discounted sales price is activated once you set the option *Volume discount* in the customer class to *Include*. A customer receives the discount in case they belong to the customer class and in case they order at least the quantity saved for the sales price.

[.instruction]
Saving sales prices as discounts:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices*.
. Open the sales price.
. Enter a number in the *Settings* tab in the field *Minimum quantity*. This number determines from which item quantity the discounted price is valid.
