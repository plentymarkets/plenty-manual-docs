:description: Learn how to use the ticket system in plentymarkets for your customer communication.
:author: team-crm

The ticket system in plentymarkets provides numerous functions for <<#1600, creating>>, <<#3400, searching>> and <<#3500, editing>> your tickets. Furthermore, project management functions are also included. On this page of the manual, you find information about the settings that you need to carry out in the user account first as well as the ticket system settings in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system* menu.

[#200]
== Carrying out settings in the user account

To be able to efficiently use the ticket system, you should save your <<#300, signature>>. Moreover, you have to assign a role to the user account in which the setting *See* or *Edit* is xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#40[activated] for the rights *CRM* or *CRM » Ticket*. The settings for users who should work with the ticket system are important for correctly configuring your ticket system.

 

[#300]
=== Saving the signature

Users that should be able to use the ticket system have to save their signatures in their own user account in the *Signature* area. When using the correct variable, the signature can later be sent in emails. For further information, refer to the xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#[EmailBuilder] page of the manual.

[IMPORTANT]
.Note the priority of the signature
====
The signature that was saved for a user in his or her user account takes priority over the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#600[signature] that is saved in the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Signature* step. +
*_This means:_* If you insert, for example, the variable `Signature in HTML format` or `Signature in plain text` in the email template, the signature is taken from the user account. If no signature is saved in the user account, the signature that is saved in the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Signature* step is used.
====

[#500]
=== Assigning rights

:right-one: pass:quotes[*CRM > Ticket > Read*]

include::_includes:partial$rights.adoc[]

////
Welche Berechtigungen eine Person mit *Admin*-Zugang Benutzer:innen ohne Adminrechte vergeben muss, damit diese mit Ticket-Rollen, Ticket-Status und Ticket-Typen arbeiten können, ist im Kapitel <<#650, Rechte für Rollen, Status und Typen vergeben>> beschrieben.
////

[#600]
== Carrying out the basic settings

Before you are able to use the ticket system, you have to carry out some basic settings in your system:

* Create <<#700, roles>>, <<#800, types>>, <<#900, statuses>>, <<#1000, status groups>>, <<#1100, topics>> and <<#create-tags-tickets, tags>> for your ticket system.

* Set up your <<#2100, email account>> in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Email accounts* menu to ensure that your emails are automatically converted into tickets.

////

[#700]
=== Adding a role

A role provides information about the members of your staff involved in handling a ticket. Roles can be individually assigned for each ticket. For example, if an employee provides assistance to customers in a ticket, it would make sense to assign this employee to the previously created role *Support*.

Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Settings* and enter a name in different languages for each role in the *Roles* tab. You can save names for the *default language* (the language that you are currently logged into your plentymarkets system with) as well as for other languages. These language versions are used when accessing the system in a different language. In other words, if you log into your plentymarkets system in *German*, you see the names that were saved under *de* in the default language column. Use the *position number* to specify which order the roles should be displayed in.

If you make someone owner of a ticket, you also need to specify the role that he or she plays in processing the ticket. In this menu, create as many different roles as desired.

[TIP]
.Example for using the ticket system as a project management tool
====
Add the roles *Project leader* and *Employee*, for example. It is possible to set up an event procedure in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Events* menu which causes the project leader to receive an email notification when the ticket’s status changes or a comment was made.
====

[.instruction]
Adding a role:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Settings*.
. Click on the *Roles* tab.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ An empty line appears.
. Enter a name and position number.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Edit a role by clicking on in the text field. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-square[role="red"]) to delete the line. You are asked to confirm your decision.

[#800]
=== Adding a type

You can create as many different types of tickets as you want, e.g. *customer inquiries* or *complaints*. Carry out the settings for the *default language*, *additional languages* and the *position number*. The procedure for doing so is the same as for the <<#700, roles>>.

[.instruction]
Adding a type:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Settings*.
. Click on the *Types & Status* tab.
. Click on *New type* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The *New type* window opens.
. Enter the name.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The type is added and opened.
. Enter the *position*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Edit a type by clicking on in the text field. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-square[role="red"]) to delete the line. You are asked to confirm your decision.

[#900]
=== Adding a status

You can specify individual statuses for each ticket type. You can reuse the same statuses for each type of ticket or you can create individual statues for each type.

[IMPORTANT]
.Assigning access rights
====
The following rule applies to the xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#100[access rights] for the ticket status that you determine in the *Setup » Account management » Roles* menu: Any limitation of visibility is dominant If a user is assigned several roles, the areas that are set to *Visible* in the *Visibility* tab have to be set also to *Visible* in all other roles of this user. If one area is set to *Invisible* in one role, this setting is also applied to all other roles of this user.
====

 

[.instruction]
Adding a status:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Settings*.
. Click on the *Types & Status* tab.
. Open the <<#800, type>> that you have just added.
. Click on *Add new status* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Enter the *name*.
. Enter the amount of *progress* that this status represents. Save the progress as a percentage between 0% and 100%. +
→ A progress bar is displayed in the ticket overview once the status has been reached. +
→ *_Note:_* Using a ticket event procedure, you can change the ticket status, e.g. you can re-activate tickets that have already been closed.
. Select a *group* from the drop-down list.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Edit a status by clicking on in the text field. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-square[role="red"]) to delete the line. You are asked to confirm your decision.

[#1000]
=== Creating a status group

Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Settings* and open the *Status groups* tab to create different status groups. Status groups help you keep track of your tickets within the ticket system. For example, if you created 10 statuses to help you follow a task from start to finish and these statuses are only relevant to one department within your company, you may find it helpful to combine these statuses into one status group.

[IMPORTANT]
.Assigning the statuses
====
Every status can only be added to one group.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a status group:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Settings*.
. Click on the *Status groups* tab.
. Click on *Add new status group* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The window *New status group* opens.
. Enter the *name*.
. Enter the *position*.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The status group is added and opened.
. Select a *colour* for the status group.
. Activate the statuses that should be included in the group.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Adding the language of the status group
====
The status group is created for the default system language. Select a different language in the editing window if you want to enter translations for the name. The selected statuses apply to every language.
====

If you activated the option *Status group* using the *Customise layout* function (icon:cog[]) in the *CRM » Ticket system* menu in the *Tickets* tab, you can see in the ticket overview the status of the ticket directly after having created the ticket. The status group is also displayed in the ticket next to *Show / Hide tags*.

[#1100]
=== Adding a topic

In the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Settings* menu in the *Topics* tab, you can create topics that are later used as headings for new messages and comments. This makes working with tickets easier and more understandable. Assign topics for your communication, e.g. *item details*, *service* and *exchange*. You can scan the topics of longer communication threads at a glance. How you assign topics is described in the <<#2600, Assigning a topic>> chapter.

[.instruction]
Adding a topic:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Settings*.
. Click on the *Topics* tab.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Enter a name for the *default language* and for the language selected from the drop-down list.
. Enter the *position*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Edit a topic by clicking on in the text field. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-square[role="red"]) to delete the line. You are asked to confirm your decision.

[#2100]
=== Setting up the email account

You need to be able to retrieve emails before tickets can automatically be created from emails. Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Email accounts* and enter the email addresses from which emails should be retrieved. plentymarkets regularly retrieves new emails from your account and converts them into tickets. The original emails can either be deleted automatically or moved to a different email folder.

Proceed as described below to set up the email account for your ticket system.

You can save up to twenty email accounts that you want to use for transferring your contacts’ emails directly into the ticket system. plentymarkets recommends that you create individual email addresses that you use specifically for tickets. Give these addresses a name that is easily recognisable.

[.instruction]
Setting up the email account:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Email accounts*.
. Click on *New configuration* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Expand (icon:angle-down[]) the *Email* area.
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-set-up-email-account>>. +
→ *_Note:_* The settings in the areas *Account*, *Retrieval* and *Despatch* are mandatory settings.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Observe test mode
====
After you have carried out all tests, you have to activate the live mode in the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Login details* step. If you do not deactivate the test mode, tickets are only sent to the email address that is saved in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Email accounts* menu.

== Creating a ticket

A ticket has many properties such as the progress, the origin, the ticket type and the status. It is possible to manage different ticket types with individual status values. Furthermore, multiple users can be owners of a ticket and edit it. This requires you to define different roles for the ticket system. You can individually assign these roles to an owner.

You can either create tickets manually or automatically. Which settings you have to carry out is described in the following chapters.

[#1700]
=== Manually creating a ticket

There are 2 ways to manually create tickets:

* without a template
* from a template

When creating tickets without a template, you have to carry out each setting individually. When creating tickets from a <<#3100, template>>, the settings saved in the template are applied.

[#1800]
==== Creating a ticket without a template

[#1900]
==== Creating a ticket from a template

If you created templates in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Templates* menu, you can create tickets or child tickets that are based on one of these general or personal templates. Before you start carrying out the settings in the following menu, note the chapters <<#3100, Creating a general ticket template>> and <<#3200, Creating a personal ticket template>>. Proceed as described below to create a ticket from a template.

[.instruction]
Creating a ticket from a template:

. Go to *CRM » Ticket system*.
. Click on *New ticket from template* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The *Create new ticket from template* window opens.
. Select the <<#3100, template>> that you have previously created in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Templates* menu from the drop-down list.
. Click on *New ticket* to apply the template settings to the ticket. +
→ A new ticket opens. The settings saved in the template are already entered.
. Make changes to the template, if necessary.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The ticket is created.

[#2000]
=== Automatically creating tickets

As described in the <<#2100, Setting up the email account>> chapter, emails are automatically converted into tickets when you have set up the email retrieval. You can automatically create tickets from eBay messages and forms. Proceed as described in the following sub-chapters.

[IMPORTANT]
.Incorrect display of emails with images that were sent by Apple devices
====
When reading emails for the ticket system that contain an image or any other attachment right in the middle of the text and that were sent by an Apple device, the text content might not be read after the image/attachment. Currently, this behaviour cannot be fixed. In such case, however, a note is displayed at the end of the ticket message that says that text content might be missing.
====

[#2200]
==== Creating tickets from eBay messages

plentymarkets gives you the possibility to retrieve eBay messages directly. Afterwards, they can immediately be imported into your ticket system. The messages are retrieved every hour. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings*, open the xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#600[Account settings] tab and make sure that the *Automatically retrieve messages* option is activated. Select a message type and message status there as well. These parameters are automatically assigned to the eBay messages. If necessary, set up a specific type and status that you want to use for your eBay messages.

You can also use the ticket system to answer afterwards. Your customer receives the message via the eBay messaging system. An eBay message may not exceed the maximum of 950 characters. If you use more characters, the message is not transmitted.

The first time that eBay messages are imported, only the ones from the last 7 days are retrieved. If an import has been carried out before, messages are imported until the date of the last import. However, this last import may not date back more than 7 days. Otherwise, only messages from the last 7 days are imported again. You can access information about the imports of eBay messages by going to *Data » API log (deprecated)* and looking at the *EbayMemberMessages* API log.

[#2300]
==== Creating tickets from forms

Integrate contact forms in your plentyShop so that interested people and customers can get in touch with you. Visitors of your plentyShop fill in the forms and tickets will be created.

In order that the tickets are created in your system and you can afterwards directly reply from within the ticket, you have to set up a valid email account in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Email accounts* menu.

You receive an email notification whenever a new message is received. This notification is separate from the ticket and any procedures that are carried out in the ticket system. The notification is sent to the email address that was saved in the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Login details* step. You receive this email notification even if you did not book the ticket system.

[TIP]
.Example for using the contact form
====
A visitor in your online shop asks a questions about your items and contacts you using the contact form in your online shop. The contact form is used to create a ticket in the ticket system. The ticket contains the customer’s message. You answer the customer by writing a message in the ticket system. With a correspondingly set up event procedure, the online shop visitor receives an email. The online shop visitor now replies to your message from her own email program. If parameters such as the ticket ID etc. were inserted into the email as template variable, the email automatically assigned to the ticket. +
*_Note:_* If the online shop visitor deleted the ticket ID or other parameters from the subject line and from the email, it is _not possible to assign_ the email to a ticket. A new ticket is created. +
A new ticket is also created if the online shop visitor decides to use the contact form again instead of answering the email directly. In this case, no assignment parameters would be included in the message and your plentymarkets system would not be able to recognise that the message belongs to a previous thread.
====

Proceed as described in the following to make sure that contact forms filled out by interested persons and customers in your online shop are automatically created as tickets.

[.instruction]
Creating tickets from forms:

. Go to *Plugins » Plugin set overview*.
. Click on the plugin set that contains the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/ceres_4697[plentyShop LTS^] plugin.
. Click in the line of the plentyShop LTS plugin. +
→ The *plentyShop LTS » Configuration* menu opens.
. Expand the *Contact form* area.
. In the *Email address of the contact form*, enter the email address which the contact forms should be sent to. +
*_Important:_* To make sure that tickets are created from the sent forms in your ticket system, you have to enter the same email address here as in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Email accounts* menu. For further information, refer to the <<#2100, Setting up the email account>> chapter.
. Enter email addresses for copies (CC) and blind copies (BCC) for the contact enquiries, if needed.
. Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) which of your contact details should be shown in the form. +
*_Note:_* The data that you select here is taken from the *Setup » Settings » Master data* menu.
. Decide if you want to show a checkbox for accepting the privacy policy in your form.
. *Save* (icon:save[]) the settings. +
→ Every time a visitor in your online shop fills in a form and sends it, a ticket will be created in your plentymarkets system.

[IMPORTANT]
.Assignment based solely on email addresses
====
Contact forms are only assigned based on the customer’s email address. Thus, it is necessary that an email address in contact forms is entered in the dedicated *Email* field. Otherwise your plentymarkets system does not recognise the information as an email address. +
If an email address is entered into a different field, e.g. into the message field, it is _not_ taken into consideration for the assignment and answers are _not_ sent to this email address.
====

If the email address can be assigned to an existing customer, this customer is displayed in the ticket. If the email address cannot be assigned to an existing customer, you do _not_ see the sender’s email address in the ticket system. Messages that are now composed in the ticket system are still sent to the sender’s address.

Use the messages to reply to your customers from within the ticket system. Note that a message can only be sent as an email if you have set up an event procedure in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Events* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.First email account is used for answers to form tickets
====
If you set up multiple <<#2100, email accounts>> under *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Email accounts*, the email account that was set up first is used for sending answers to form tickets.
====

[#2400]
== Adding a message

Messages are used for external communication, i.e. for communicating with your customers. Click on *Add message* to create a new message. Enter your message text into the text field of the *Message* window. Use the toolbar to format the text. If you saved a xref:welcome:customise-system.adoc#50[complimentary close] in the user account, it is automatically added to the end of this user’s messages.

A timer starts in the *Events* area when the message is created. This makes it possible to measure the time to the exact second. If the process needs to be billed, you can enter the time into the *Min.* field to the left of the timer. The lower portion of the event area lists the events that were previously carried out. The events are listed in chronological order. For example, you can see if a different employee has already edited this ticket.

[IMPORTANT]
.New event with filters service type, bill and duration added
====
In the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Events* menu, it is possible to add the event *New event* and the filters *Service type*, *Bill* and *Duration*. This allows you to differentiate in more detail and thus to also send different email templates.

Sending automatic email templates for service units in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* menu in the *Email accounts* assistant » Step: *Automatic despatch* still applies for events that were created in the contact data record.

*_Important:_* This function was deactivated for the ticket system. This is why you have to set up a new event procedure in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Events* menu.
====

[.instruction]
Billing a process:

. Go to *CRM » Ticket system*.
. Use the search function (icon:search[role="blue"]) and open the ticket that should be edited.
. Click on *Add message*. +
→ The *Message* window opens and the timer starts.
. Activate the option *Bill* if the process should be billed.
. Select the type of process from the drop-down list.  +
→ The following options can be selected: *Call*, *Ticket*, *Email*, *Meeting*, *Webinar*, *Development* and *Design*.
. Enter the time in minutes in the *Min.* field.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Information about the timer
====
If you are not able to begin working as soon as you opened the message window, click on *Reset* when you are ready to begin. The timer is reset to zero. If you want to edit the message at a later point in time, click on *Pause* and afterwards again on *Play* in order to edit the message further.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Sending messages via email
====
Messages are only sent as emails if an <<#2900, event procedure>> was set up for this purpose. +
To do so, the event *New message from employee* has to be set up. The procedure *Send email* is recommended. The email template that is selected here has to contain the template variable `$TicketLastMessage`. Furthermore, *Contact (CRM)* has to be selected as the recipient. The email subject should also include the ticket ID. Use the template variable `$TicketID` for this.
====

[#2500]
== Adding a comment

Comments are added the same way as <<#2400, messages>>. Note that comments are _only visible internally_. They are _not_ visible to the customer. This is intentional because the comment function is meant for sending messages within your company. You can use the comment function to pass on the current state of the ticket or information about the topic or the customer to a different employee or user of the ticket system. If you saved a xref:welcome:customise-system.adoc#50[complimentary close] in the user account, it is automatically added to the user’s comments.

A timer starts in the *Events* area when the comment is created. This makes it possible to measure the time to the exact second. If the process needs to be billed, you can enter the time into the *Min.* field to the left of the timer. The lower portion of the event area lists the events that were previously carried out. The events are listed in chronological order. For example, you can see if a different employee has already edited this ticket.

[#2600]
== Assigning a topic

A topic can be saved with every message or comment. Although this is not mandatory, topics can help you understand the general content of a message or comment at a glance. This is particularly useful for longer texts. The topic thus functions as a headline.

Select the topic from the drop-down list above the text field of the message or comment window. Once you saved, the topic is displayed as a headline for this part of the communication. You need to create topics before they can be selected in the ticket system. To do so, go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Settings* in the *Topics* tab. How you add topics is described in the <<#1100, Adding a topic>> chapter.

[.instruction]
Assigning a topic:

. Go to *CRM » Ticket system*.
. Use the search function (icon:search[role="blue"]) and open the ticket that should be edited.
. Click on *Add message* or *Add comment*.
. Select a topic from the drop-down list.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#2700]
== Entering answers to FAQs

You can insert previously written text blocks into messages. Go to *CMS » FAQs* to create these text blocks. This saves you a lot of time and effort, particularly if you often answer the same questions or deal with the same problems. You can also enter long texts here and save a lot of time when working with your tickets. Create a useful structure of folders, sub-folders and questions. Make sure to select the setting *visible* for the ticket system in the *CRM » FAQ » Tab: Folder » [Expand folder] » Tab: Settings* menu.

[#2710]

== Manually sending an email template

You are not limited to only communicating in the ticket system with messages and comments. You can also send xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[email templates]. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* to manage email templates. An email template includes a standard text that is applicable to all recipients. You can supplement this text with dynamic content that is automatically inserted with the help of template variables.

First create an email template. For example, use the template variables for the subject line and the text as listed in <<#table-template-variables-ticket-system>>. You can see a list of all the template variables that are available for an email template by clicking on *Template variables and template functions* on the top left within the template. From there, you can insert the template variables into the template simply by clicking on it. <<#table-template-variables-ticket-system>> shows a list of useful template variables for the ticket system.

For the email template, select e.g. the template variables `$TicketID` and `$TicketTitle` if you want to have the ticket ID and the ticket title displayed in the subject line. If the text should contain the status, the priority and a link to the ticket, select the template variables `$TicketStatus`, `$TicketPriority` and `$TicketBackendURL` and enter these in the text field of the template.

[.instruction]
Creating an email template:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates*.
. Click on *New email template* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Carry out the desired settings. For further information, refer to the explanations on the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#[Emails] page of the manual in the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[Creating an email template] chapter.
. Select the setting *Only text in HTML format* under *Content*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Only text in HTML format
====
Open the email templates and look at the *Settings* tab. Make sure that the *Content* drop-down list was set to *Only text in HTML format*. Otherwise the template variables are not translated.

Proceed as described below to manually send an email template.

[.instruction]
Manually sending an email template:

. Go to *CRM » Ticket system*.
. Use the search function (icon:search[role="blue"]) and open the ticket that should be edited.
. Click on *Send email template* (icon:envelope-o[role="purple"]).  +
→ The *Send email template* window opens.
. Select an email template from the drop-down list.

If the ticket is not linked to a customer, the email template cannot be sent. If you manually send email templates, the signature displayed in these emails is the signature that was saved in the system’s email settings.

[#2900]
== Automatically sending an email template

In the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Events* menu, you use filters to select tickets and then assign the tickets to automatic procedures which are carried out by an event procedure. One example would be that when a ticket enters the system, the email template is automatically sent to the customer and all ticket owners receive a reminder via e-mail template when the ticket is in a certain status (in our example Status *All*) and assigned to a certain owner (in our example Owner *plentytest*).

[[image-event-procedure-automatic-reply]]
.Example of an event procedure “Automatic reply to customer”
image::crm:crm-ticket-system-event-procedure-automatic-reply-customer.png[width=640, height=360, alt=Example of an event procedure “Automatic reply to customer”]

It is important that you insert the templates variables available in plentymarkets in the email template as described in the <<#2900, Manually sending an email template>> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Set up an event procedure also for the despatch of messages and comments
====
Note that an event procedure also has to be set up for sending messages and comments via email. If you answer your customers with messages in the ticket system, you need to set up an event procedure that sends the last ticket message as an email. Otherwise the customer does not receive your answer.
====

=== Displaying the contact data

The *Customer* tab of a ticket in the *CRM » Ticket system* menu contains the xref:crm:edit-contact.adoc#details-individual-areas[contact data] as it is also found in the *CRM » Contacts » [Open contact]* menu. You can also edit the contact data record here. This tab is only visible if the ticket is linked to a contact.

[#3800]
=== Showing orders

Go to *CRM » Ticket system* and see the customer’s orders in the *Search orders* tab of the ticket. You can search for orders and edit them in this menu. This tab is only visible if the ticket is linked to a contact.

[#3900]
=== Showing the attachment

Go to *CRM » Ticket system* and see all file attachments that were uploaded in the *Attachment* tab of the ticket. Both your customers and staff members can attach documents to tickets and have permanent access to them. The number of attachments is displayed in parentheses in the tab’s title. Once the first file has been successfully uploaded, a table is displayed. The table lists the file name, the name of the employee or customer who uploaded the file as well as the visibility and the date.

The image files immediately open after the click. If this is not supported by the browser, the file can be downloaded. With the setting *Visibility*, you decide whether the file is also visible for your customers or only for you and your employees.

If you activated the option *Attachment* using the *Customise layout* function (icon:cog[]) in the *CRM » Ticket system* menu in the *Tickets* tab, you can directly see in the ticket overview the tickets that have an attachment.

=== Creating a task

Tasks help you plan concrete duties and assign them to different employees. Tasks that you created in the *Tasks* tab of the ticket are linked to the ticket. This link is also visible in the overview of tasks under *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Tasks*. The number of tasks is displayed in parentheses in the tab’s title. This chapter explains how to search for tasks.

[#4200]
=== Linking tickets

In the *CRM » Ticket system* menu in the *Children* tab of a ticket, you can link tickets with each other. This means that you can assign further tickets (so called children) to a ticket or create a child ticket in the *Children* tab. One ticket can have several children (parent-child concept) and these children can have children themselves. This characteristic is especially helpful if you have bigger projects and you want to divide tasks and assign them to different members of your staff (owners) or to different teams. Open the original parent ticket in order to see the processing status of the child ticket. The number of child tickets is displayed in parentheses in the *Children* tab.

[#4300]
==== Assigning a ticket as child ticket

You can assign existing tickets as child tickets. The assignment is done in the *Ticket search* tab.

[.instruction]

The assignment can be removed in the *Children* tab. Activate the children ticket and click on *Remove*. The child ticket then becomes a normal ticket again and can be found in the *Ticket search* tab.

[#4500]
== Creating a folder

You can create custom folders. You can create your folder structure as needed. Folders are especially useful in grouping together those tickets that were not already grouped together because of their filter parameters, but that you would like to have together for other reasons. You can always rename your customised folders and delete them, when you no longer need them. The filters that you created are only visible for you.

[.instruction]

If you create a new folder in your ticket system, enter a name for the new folder if you want this folder to be a main folder. Click on an existing folder if you want to create a sub-folder within this existing folder. When creating a sub-folder, enter a slash and the new name behind the name of the main folder. As an alternative, enter the path into the text field, e.g. the name of the main folder and the name of the new folder. +
Example: Frequent buyers/B2B. The sub-folder B2B is created within the main folder Frequent buyers.

[#4800]
== Assigning emails in the ticket system

Emails in the ticket system are assigned to tickets with the help of keywords or text parameters that are automatically recognised by your plentymarkets system. If an email contains a ticket ID, the email is automatically saved as a message within the corresponding ticket. As already explained in the <<#2100, Setting up the email account>> chapter, you should set up a separate email account and email address that are only used for the ticket system.

Note the keywords and alternative spellings that are used for assigning emails to tickets as listed in <<#table-assignment-ticket-system>>. Both upper and lower case letters can be used. Check the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[email templates] that you use in the ticket system. If needed, correct or add the template variables.

[[table-assignment-ticket-system]]
.Assignment parameters and permitted spellings

|====

If you have set up a special email account for the ticket system, your emails are automatically transferred into the ticket system. This is done with the help of the parameters listed in <<#table-assignment-ticket-system>>. Emails are created as follows:

* If an email contains a ticket ID, the email is automatically saved as a message within the ticket.
* If an email contains a contact ID, customer number or customer name, a ticket is automatically created. The customer data is saved in the ticket’s *Customer* tab.
* If an email contains an order ID or invoice ID, a ticket is automatically created. The order is saved in the ticket’s *Search orders* tab.

[IMPORTANT]
.Only unread messages are synchronised
====
Emails are assigned to tickets whenever the ticket system is synchronised. The email may not have previously been opened or read in the email program. This is because only unread messages are synchronised.
Pay attention to the information about the *Process* setting in <<#table-set-up-email-account>> in the <<#2100, Setting up the email account>> chapter.
====

The examples below illustrate different ways that emails are assigned to tickets:

[discrete]
=== Assigning by ticket ID

An email contains the keyword *Ticket ID 1* as its subject. The ticket system recognises this keyword. The ticket system would also recognise the keyword if it was located e.g. within the text of the email. +
During the synchronisation process, the email that contains the keyword *Ticket ID 1* is automatically attached as a message to the ticket that has the ID 1.

[discrete]
=== Assigning by contact ID

If a contact ID is included in the email, the contact is automatically linked to the ticket when the message is imported. You can tell that this information was linked because an entry was made in the *Customer* field and the *Customer* tab contains data about the customer. Therefore, emails that relate to customers should always include the customer ID or customer number so that this data is available in the ticket immediately.

[discrete]
=== Assigning by order ID

If an order ID is the only parameter saved in the email, a new ticket is created and the order that has this ID is loaded in the *Search orders* tab.

[discrete]
=== Assigning by invoice number

If an invoice number is specified, the order is searched for and displayed in the ticket’s *Search orders* tab.

[IMPORTANT]
.Sender’s email address takes priority over the email address saved in the customer data record
====
If an email doesn’t contain any of the parameters necessary for assigning it to a ticket, the sender’s email address is used when replies are sent.

If an email contains customer parameters (i.e. the ticket was linked to a specific customer) and this customer data includes an email address, the sender’s email address is still used when replies are sent. The sender’s email address always takes priority.
====

[#5300]
== Creating a ticket card

Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Ticket cards* to create a print template that is used to generate your tickets as PDF files which you can file or print. Setting up ticket cards can basically be compared to the procedure of setting up xref:fulfilment:generating-documents.adoc#address-label-template[address label templates].

The number of cards per page changes depending on the size of the page, the number of lines and columns and the size of the cards. Also consider the spacing between the cards when you set up the page.

The parameters, e.g. the ticket ID, are displayed as soon as the values have been entered into the fields *X*, *Y* and *mm*. Optionally, you can enter a field name that is displayed before the value.

In the lines *Message* and *Comment*, you can select whether the oldest or the latest message and the oldest or the latest comment should be displayed on the ticket card.

The priorities start with *0* (= grey star, lowest priority) and go up to *5* (= 2 yellow stars, highest priority).

[TIP]
.Allow line break for longer lines
====
If several people are owners of the ticket and you want them all displayed on the ticket card, you need to activate the option *Allow line break*. It is also possible to allow line breaks for the setting *Ticket title*.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a ticket card:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Ticket cards*.
. Expand the *New template* area.
. Enter a *name*.
. Enter the width and height of the *Page* and the *Card*.
. Enter the parameters for those elements that are to be displayed on the ticket card.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[NOTE]
.Generating a preview of the ticket card
====
You can see a preview once you have created the new template. Expand the template. Enter the *Ticket ID* and click on *Preview*.
====

[#5400]
== Exporting tickets in a PDF file

After you saved the <<#5300, ticket card>> template in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Ticket cards* menu, it is available in the *CRM » Ticket system* menu in the *Tickets* tab in the drop-down list *Print ticket* of the *Group function*. Proceed as follows to export your tickets in a PDF file.

[.instruction]
Exporting tickets in a PDF file:

. Go to *CRM » Ticket system*.
. In the ticket overview, activate those tickets that you want to export.
. Click on *Group function*. +
→ The *Group function* window opens.
. Select the option *Print ticket*.
. Select a template from the drop-down list.
. If required, enter a *message* or a *comment*. +
→ This entry is saved for all printed tickets (not displayed on the printed ticket card, but in the ticket in the system).
. Click on *Apply* (icon:cog[]). +
→ The PDF file is created.

[#5500]
== Creating tickets in the My account area

Your customers can create tickets in the *My account* area of your online shop. They can send messages there and see answers to the ticket. If an event procedure is used to send the contact an email and this email contains the template variable `$TicketURL`, the contact is able to click on this link to directly open up the ticket in the *My account* area. They are able to answer the message there.

[#5600]
== Creating ticket statistics

Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Statistics* to create statistics regarding the tickets in your ticket system. You can choose between the statistic types *Tickets by current status*, *Tickets by system state* or *Tickets by status*.

For further information, refer to the xref:data:statistics.adoc#[Statistics] page of the manual. It is also described there how to create and analyse statistics.
