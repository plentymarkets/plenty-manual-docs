[#manage]
== Managing the accounts receivable list

The table in the *CRM » AR list* menu includes information about the contact, the number of claims held for each contact as well as the total pending amount for these claims. If a contact has overpaid an outstanding claim, this amount is offset against other outstanding claims. If no further outstanding claims exist, a deficit is displayed in the *Pending amount* column. +
When opening the AR list, a filtered view of the table is displayed. The table is automatically filtered according to the contact types *Customer* and *Guest*. Use the filter xref:crm:ar-list.adoc#intable-ar-list-filter-contact-type[contact type] to display accounts receivables of further contact types.

When you click in the table on the line of the contact ID, you are redirected to the xref:crm:edit-contact.adoc#details-individual-areas[contact data record] of the corresponding contact. Click on the left side on *Account* to see the open amounts with the exceeded payment due dates of this contact. If it is a guest order, clicking into the row redirects you to the corresponding order.

This table is customisable. This means that you can decide which information is displayed in the table columns. To do so, proceed as follows:

[.instruction]
Customising the table:

. Click on *Configure columns* (material:settings[]). +
→ The window *Configure columns* opens.
. Select which columns you want to be displayed. Note <<#table-ar-list>>.
. Move (material:drag_indicator[]) the columns so they are displayed in the order you need them in.
. Click on *Confirm* to save your settings.

When you have adapted the table once, these settings are saved. You can change the layout any time. A list of the available columns can be found in <<#table-ar-list>>. There, it is also stated whether the column is a default column. Default columns are shown when tables are not customised.
