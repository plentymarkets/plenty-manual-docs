[#code-example-shipping-profile]
=== Code example: Shipping profile

In the <<#intable-widget-code, code widget>>, insert a code that causes a note regarding the freight-forwarding company and contacting to only be displayed in the email to your customers if the shipping service provider in the shipping profile is a freight-forwarding company. In our example the shipping profile with the freight-forwarding company has the ID `6`.

.Same approach in case of footers
====
Proceed in the same way using the code example and insert the code into the code widget in the footer if you also want to display different footers depending on the plenty ID.

[#code-example-date-format]
=== Code example: Date format

The setting for the date format that you have carried out in the *Language settings* area does _not_ apply for date-related twig expressions that you use in the code widget. Here, you have to carry out the formatting yourself.

*_Example:_* If you have selected a hyphen for the English date notation in the language settings, but insert one of the following twig expressions for the order date in the code widget, the notation used for the date in the code widget will be returned in the email template. The setting from the *Language settings* area will be overwritten here.

[#date-format-example-one]
==== dd.mm.yyyy without time

[#code-example-number-format]
=== Code example: Number format

The setting for the number format that you have carried out in the *Language settings* area does _not_ apply for number values in twig expressions that you use in the code widget. Here, you have to carry out the formatting yourself.

*_Example:_* If you have selected a dot for the English number notation in the language settings, but insert one of the following twig expressions for the total invoice amount in the code widget, the notation used for the amount in the code widget will be returned in the email template. The setting from the *Language settings* area will be overwritten here.

[#number-format-example-one]

[#code-examples-subject]
== Code examples for the subject line

In the subject line of your template, insert a code that displays a certain word at the beginning of the subject line in case of certain order referrers. In our example, the word `[IMPORTANT]` is always displayed at the beginning of the subject line if the referrers are between `9` and `11`.

[#code-examples-expert-mode]
== Code examples for the expert mode

By means of an example, we will show in this chapter how you can use complex templates in expert mode. 

We will create an order confirmation in expert mode as an example. The following steps are required:

1. Create a folder in which you save the basic template
2. Create a regular template that contains the *Order items* widget
3. Extend the basic template with the text for the order confirmation

It is best to create a folder with the name `Auxiliary templates`. Create a template in expert mode in it and name it `Basic template`, for example. The basic template forms the framework for your template, so to speak.

[source,twig]
----
include::example$emailbuilder-code-example-expert-mode-basic-template.html[]

----

We also want to show the order items in the order confirmation. To do so, we create another “regular” template in which the *Order items* widget is the only content. In our example, this template has the ID 51 and the language ID for DE is 105.

[[image-emailbuilder-expert-mode-order-items]]
.*Order items* widget
image::crm:emailbuilder-expert-mode-example-order-items-widget.png[width=640, height=360]

In the next step, we extend the basic template with the text for the order confirmation. In our example, the basic template in DE has the ID 103.
