:author: team-crm

I would like to send the tracking URL to my customers once the package number is available at the order. What can I do?

[discrete]
== Required steps (short version)

* Save the tracking URL at the shipping service provider
* Set up an email template in the EmailBuilder
** Insert the variable `Tracking URL` in the template
* Link event procedure that sends the template when the package has been registered at the service provider and a package number is available at the order.

[#save-tracking-url]
== Save the tracking URL at the shipping service provider

Many shipping service providers allow customers to track their packages with tracking URLs. A functional tracking URL should include the package number and the recipient's postcode.
You can send your customers an email that contains the tracking URL. This way, your customers can see the current status of their shipments at the shipping service provider as well as the estimated time of delivery.

Therefore, first save the tracking URL at the shipping service provider. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and switch to the *Shipping service provider* tab. Enter the tracking URL in the *Tracking URL* field.

The DHL tracking URL is already saved in your system and looks as follows:
`+http://nolp.dhl.de/nextt-online-public/set_identcodes.do?lang=de&zip=[PLZ]&idc=[PaketNr]+`.

[TIP]
.You don’t know the tracking URL?
====
If you don’t know the tracking URL of the shipping service provider, proceed as follows:

* Check our user manual. We listed the currently valid, known tracking URLs in the corresponding sub-chapters of the shipping service provider. You can access the sub-chapters of the shipping service provider via the xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#2500[Overview of shipping service providers] chapter and have a look whether the tracking URL is listed there.

* If you don’t find the information you are looking for, please contact your contact person at the corresponding shipping service provider and ask for the correct, currently valid tracking URL.
