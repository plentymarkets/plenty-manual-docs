:description: Learn how to use the Messenger in plentymarkets both to send and receive emails and to use it for internal communication purposes.
:author: team-crm

The *CRM » Messenger (Test phase)* menu allows you to manage the external communication with your customers via emails as well as the internal communication via messages. If you use the whisper mode in messages, these messages are only visible in your plentymarkets system and _cannot_ be seen by your contacts.

[#box-complete-assistant]
[IMPORTANT]
.Complete assistant only for sending and receiving emails via messenger
====
If you want to use the messenger for sending and receiving emails, you have to complete the *Messenger configuration* <<#complete-assistant, assistant>> in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup*. +
If you only want to whisper messages which means that you use the messenger as notes only without sending and receiving emails via the messenger, you do _not_ have to complete the *Messenger configuration* assistant.
====

The *CRM » Messenger (Test phase)* menu is structured as follows:

image::crm:messenger-menu-structure.png[width=640, height=360]

* *Navigation*: Here you can navigate through different parts of the menu. The currently selected area (blue background) is displayed in the main window on the right. Click on material:menu[] to expand or collapse the navigation bar. +
** Available areas in the navigation: <<#create-message, New message>>, <<#group-function, Inbox>>, <<#new-messages, New messages>>, <<#my-messages, My messages>>, <<#trash, Trash>>. The number behind the name in the individual areas shows the number of unread messages.
* *Toolbar*: Here you can <<#search-conversation, search>> for conversations, <<#configure-columns, adjust the columns in the overview>>, set the results to be shown per page and click through the pages with the conversations.
* *Main window*: Here you can see whichever area is currently open. +
** *Overview*: When you start a search, you’ll see the results in an overview. The overview provides information about the conversations found at a glance. You see, for example, the email addresses of the senders, the subject, the date when the message was received, the assigned tags and by means of the icon material:attach_file[], you can see whether the message has an attachment. +
** *Detail view*: When you open a message, the details will become visible below the main window. The detail view of a conversation is divided into the messages and the editor where you type in your replies.

== New features

[.collapseBox]
.New features compared to the “old” Messenger
--
You can find the following improvements in the new Messenger that haven’t been available in the “old” Messenger:

* Receiving emails from your customers
* Sending emails to your customers
* Using the group function in the Messenger
* Possibility to subscribe for conversations and receive notifications regarding new messages within this conversation
// * Display in the back end when other system users are replying to a message
--

[#preparatory-settings]
== Preparatory settings

If users of the type *Back end* should be able to work with the messenger, a person with *Admin* access has to assign rights to those users. Moreover, you have to create tags in order that these are available for the Messenger. You also have to grant certain rights for the tags.

[#tags-messenger]
=== Creating tags for the messenger

You can assign tags to the messages in the Messenger and filter them in the overview. Tags are keywords that make grouping messages very easy.

Which user rights are required and how to create tags is explained below.

[#create-tags]
==== Creating tags

include::_includes:page$tags-creation.adoc[]

[TIP]
.Create tags for the availability *Message (billable)*
====
If you want to create messages and <<#capture-minutes, capture minutes>> that should be _billed_ via the Messenger, you have to create tags for the availability *Message (billable)* in the same way. You have to add these tags to the <<#create-message, message>>.

[#complete-assistant]
=== Completing the assistant

[IMPORTANT]
.Complete assistant only for sending and receiving emails via messenger
====
If you want to use the messenger for sending and receiving emails, you have to complete the *Messenger configuration* <<#complete-assistant, assistant>> in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup*. +
If you only want to whisper messages which means that you use the messenger as notes only without sending and receiving emails via the messenger, you do _not_ have to complete the *Messenger configuration* assistant.
====

To be able to send and receive messages with the Messenger, you have to complete the *Messenger configuration* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* menu. This assistant has several steps to complete. These steps are explained in the following.

[TIP]
You have to complete the assistant for every inbox that you want to create. +
You can assign tags to each inbox to be able to <<#search-conversation, filter>> for these tags later.

[#service-activation]
==== Service activation

In the *Service activation* step, activate the Messenger service for this inbox. If the button is blue (material:toggle_on[role=skyBlue]), the service is activated. If the button is grey (material:toggle_off[]), the service is _not_ activated.

If you later activate multiple inboxes, which means that you completed the assistant multiple times for the individual inboxes, you can deactivate the corresponding inbox again in this step.

[#email-forwarding]
==== Email forwarding

In the *Email forwarding* step, a cryptic email address is automatically created that builds the forwarding email address. Use this email address to set up your email client. This ensures that your emails will be forwarded automatically. Note that you _cannot_ change this cryptic email address.

In the lower part, enter all email addresses that are allowed to send messages to the cryptic, forwarding email address stated above. You can add as many email addresses as you like by clicking on *Add new entry* (material:add[]). Existing email addresses can be deleted by clicking on *Remove entry* (material:delete[]). *_Note:_* At least one email address has to be entered here.

[#settings-email-despatch]
==== Settings for sending emails

In the *Settings for sending emails* step, save the login details of the email inbox that you want to use to send emails from. This is necessary to make sure that your plentymarkets system is able to send and receive emails via the messenger.

After having entered the login details, select the encryption method and enter the sender email address and the sender name. This email address and this name will be shown to the recipients of your emails from this inbox.

*_Note for mailbox.org mailboxes:_* Enter the port *465* and select *SSL* as encryption method.

In the *Default inbox*, you can activate (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]) the option *Determine as default inbox* to make sure that this inbox is preselected when writing new messages in the messenger.

////

Select also in this step an email template for the email despatch.

[IMPORTANT]
.Live mode in *Email accounts* assistant has to be activated
====
In the xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#email-server-login-details[Login details] step of the *Email accounts* assistant, the option *Activate live mode* has to be activated (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]) in the *Would you like to activate the live mode?* area. This ensures that the test mode will be deactivated and all emails sent to the respective recipients. 

Activating the live mode applies globally for the entire email despatch in plentymarkets. Thus, it also applies for the email despatch via the messenger.
====

[TIP]
.Use the default template *Messenger default NEW*
====
We recommend to use the default template *Messenger default NEW* for the Messenger. This template is already available in your system in the *CRM » EmailBuilder* menu in the *Default templates* folder. You can, of course, adjust this template according to your needs. This template will be automatically preselected when you write a new message.

The template contains the following variables:

* Name of the client in the subject line, displayed as &#123;&#8288;&#123;globals.clientName&#125;&#8288;&#125;
** So called _twig expressions_ in double curly brackets need to be inserted in the template’s subject because it is not possible to use “normal” variables in the subject line. For further information, refer to the xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#variables-emailbuilder[Available variables and twig expressions] chapter on the xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#[EmailBuilder] page.
* Full name
* Signature in HTML format
====

Of course, you can select a template in this step that you have created yourself in the *CRM » EmailBuilder* menu.

[#settings-email-receipt]
==== Settings for receiving emails

In the *Settings for receiving emails* step, select one or multiple tags that should be assigned to the messages when these messages are received from and sent to the forwarded addresses.

In the last section, select the subscribers who should be informed in case of new messages. Either select individual users from the drop-down list or select roles in order that all users that are assigned to this role will subscribe for new messages in this inbox.

[#summary]
==== Summary

In this step, a summary of all entries that you made in the single steps is listed. You can take a look at all the settings that you carried out, adjust setting within the steps, if needed and complete the assistant afterwards via the summary step.

[#collect-messages]
=== Collecting messages in the messenger

In the *Messenger integration* step of the *Email accounts* assistant, you can determine whether all sent emails and attachments should be collected in the messenger. Furthermore, you can decide in which inbox the emails should be collected and which tags should be assigned to the conversations.

If you activate the service to collect the emails, the emails from the following plentymarkets areas will be saved and shown in the messenger: 

* Automatic despatch
* Order events
* Order procedures
* Group function in the contact data record
* Orders » Orders (Test phase)
* Group function in the order

You can find the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* menu. For further information about collecting the emails, refer to the xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#email-messenger-integration[Messenger integration] chapter on the xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#[EmailBuilder] page.

[#paypal-dispute]
== Link to PayPal Dispute plugin

The link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/paypaldispute_6582[PayPal Dispute^] plugin allows you to work on problems and solve conflicts with your customers directly in your plentymarkets system.

[IMPORTANT]
Note that at least version 1.1.2 of the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/paypaldispute_6582[PayPal Dispute^] plugin is required to be able to use PayPal Dispute with the Messenger.

The advantage of using the PayPal Dispute plugin is that you will be informed about all cases of customers that reported a problem with a merchandise or service to PayPal directly in your plentymarkets back end. Go to *CRM » Messenger (Test phase)* to see all dispute messages. The buyer has 4 options to report a problem. The reactions available to you depend on the problem reported by the customer and on the level of escalation the problem has reached. There are 2 escalation levels in case of problems. The first level is called *dispute* and the second level is called *claim*. The 4 options available to the buyer are the following:

* Item not received
* Item not as described
* Unauthorised activity
* Billing issue

As long as a problem is still on the first level of escalation, the *dispute* level, you can still exchange messages with the customer to solve the problem. Once a problem is escalated to PayPal, the level of escalation will be set to *claim* and simple messages will no longer be sent to PayPal.

To see which requirements need to be met, how to install the plugin and many more details about PayPal Dispute, refer to the xref:payment:paypal.adoc#300[PayPal] page.

Within the conversation in the messenger, you can see that it is a PayPal Dispute case by means of the PayPal symbol. Click on the case to open the *PayPal* plugin and to xref:payment:paypal.adoc#360[react to this case].
