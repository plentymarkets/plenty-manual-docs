Use the messenger to create notes about your contacts in the back end. These notes are only visible in your plentymarkets back end and cannot be accessed by your contacts.

On this page of the manual, you learn how to create new messages for your contact, display all notes that are available for your contact as well as edit and delete existing messages.
