Use the messenger to create notes about your contacts in the back end. These notes are only visible in your plentymarkets back end and _cannot_ be accessed by your contacts.

On this page of the manual, you learn how to <<#new-message, create>> new messages for your contact, <<#display-messages, display all messages>> that are available for your contact as well as <<#edit-message, edit>> and <<#delete-message, delete>> existing messages.

If users of the type *Back end* should be able to work with the messenger, you as a person with *Admin* access have to assign rights to those users. Moreover, you have to <<#tags-messenger, create tags>> in order that these are available for the messenger.

[TIP]
If you want to create messages that should be _billed_ via the Messenger, you have to create tags for the availability *Message (billable)* in the same way. You have to add these tags to the <<#create-message, message>>.
