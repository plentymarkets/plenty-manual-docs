All emails that are sent with plentymarkets are based on email templates. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* to manage email templates. Create as many email templates as desired. In case of certain events, e.g. if a new order is placed in your online shop or when a contact subscribes to a newsletter, your plentymarkets system automatically creates emails from these templates and sends them to your contacts. You determine the time when the emails are to be sent automatically.

Learn in the following video tutorial how you link your email account with plentymarkets, set up your signature and activate the info service:

== Saving the email signature

Go to *Setup» Client » [Select client] » Email » Signature* to save the signature. The signature is then automatically inserted into an email template.

[IMPORTANT]
.Pay attention to the legal requirements
====
Note the legal requirements that are in effect for your online shop as to the content of an email signature, e.g. specifying the VAT number. Email signatures are required to include the same information as company business letters. Non-compliance can result in a fine or in a costly warning being issued by a competitor. If in doubt, ask a specialised solicitor.
====

[.instruction]
Saving the email signature:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Signature*.
. Enter the text for your signature. Pay attention to the explanations given in the green box.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Formatting the signature by means of the HTML editor
====
Select whether you save the text of your signature as *plain text signature* or *HTML signature*. If you want to format the text, it is recommended to enter the text in the *HTML signature* area. An integrated HTML editor is provided to assist you with editing and formatting.

Go to *Setup » Settings » Editors* and determine which editors should be available for certain areas in your plentymarkets system. Choose between *Editor*, *Syntax editor* and *Text field*.
====

[#700]
== Setting up the email information service

In the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Info service* menu, you have the possibility of sending a "blind copy" (BCC) of all emails sent by your plentymarkets system to an email address of your choice. This can be particularly helpful in the early stages of your online shop, as it allows you to maintain an overview of all sent emails and recognise where processes can still be improved. You can, for example, also set that you automatically receive an informational email for each order.

[.instruction]
Setting up the email information service:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Info service*.
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-email-info-service>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-email-info-service]]
.Setting up the email information service
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *All outgoing emails are sent as blind copies (BCC) to the email address entered in the next line*
|Select whether all outgoing emails are sent as BCC to one or multiple email addresses. The email addresses are entered in the next line. +
*YES* = The option is activated. +
*NO* = The option is deactivated (default setting).

| *Email address for blind copy*
|Enter the email address(es). If you enter multiple email addresses, separate them with commas and do not use spaces.

| *Deactivate blind copies (BCC) for the newsletter*
|Select whether blind copies (BCC) should be sent for newsletters. +
Activate option = No blind copies are sent for newsletters. +
Deactivate option = Blind copies are sent for newsletters (default setting).

| *Send notification to email address when a new order was received (next line)*
|Select whether an email should be sent when an order is received. The email addresses are entered in the next line. +
*YES* = An email is sent when an order is received. +
*NO* = No email is sent (default setting). +
 *_Important:_* This function is not available for new orders on eBay. It is recommended instead to set up an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedure].

| *Email address*
|Enter the email address(es). If you enter multiple email addresses, separate them with commas and do not use spaces.
|====

[#800]
== Using the HTML design

Use the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » HTML design* menu to set an HTML design for each client (store). The HTML design can then be linked to email templates. You can activate or deactivate the design separately for every email template.

Use this function to ensure that for example the letterhead including the logo of your company automatically appears in all selected email templates. By doing so, it is no longer needed to insert the letterhead and the logo for each email template individually. If you make changes in this menu, you change the design for all linked email templates.

If you wish to create your email templates without a centrally saved HTML design, proceed with the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[Creating an email template] chapter.

[#900]
=== Uploading the company logo to the webspace

You can adapt your email templates to the design of your online shop, e.g. by inserting your company logo in the HTML design. First, you have to upload the logo to the webspace. After you created the email template, you insert the <<#1750, logo in the HTML design>> and xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1100[link] the design with this email template.

[.instruction]
Uploading the company logo to the webspace:

. Go to *CMS » Webspace*.
. Click on the folder that you want to upload the logo to. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Create a new folder (material:create_new_folder[]).
. Click on *Upload file* (material:file_upload[]) or use drag-and-drop. +
→ The logo is uploaded.
. In the line of the image, click on *Copy to clipboard* (material:content_copy[]) to copy the image URL.

[#1000]
=== Inserting template variables in the HTML design

First, insert the template variables `$EmailContentHTML` and `$SignatureHTML` in the HTML design. After you created the email template, xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1100[link] the HTML design with the email template.

[IMPORTANT]
.$EmailContentHTML has to be present
====
The template variable `$EmailContentHTML` has to be inserted in the HTML design. Otherwise, the HTML design cannot be used.
====

[.instruction]
Inserting template variables in the HTML design:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » HTML design*.
. Insert the template variables `$EmailContentHTML` and `$SignatureHTML`. +
→ `$EmailContentHTML` contains the content of the email. `$SignatureHTML` contains the signature.
. Format the HTML design as desired.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Now create the email template as described in the following chapters. Afterwards, you insert the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1750[logo in the HTML design] and xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1100[link] the design with the email template.

[#1200]
== Creating an email template

Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* to create new email templates. The folder *General email templates* already contains preconfigured email templates. You can of course make changes to these templates.

You can define up to 2 attachments for each email template:

* a PDF document from the *Orders » Fulfilment* menu, e.g. an invoice

* a document that you uploaded in the *CMS » Documents* menu, e.g. an item brochure or a user guide.

These attachments can be sent to your contacts in a standardised way via email templates. For example, it would be useful to attach PDF documents of your cancellation rights and terms and conditions to the email template *Confirmation of online store order*.

[TIP]
.Sending reversal document and invoice in one email template
====
It is possible to select the option *Reversal document and new invoice* from the *PDF attachment* drop-down list of an email template. If the order changes after the invoice has been created, you can send your contacts both documents in one email.
====

Learn in the following video tutorial how to create an email template:

| *Template variables and template functions*
|Click on icon:code[role="blue"] to open the *Template variables and functions* area from which the template variables and template functions are copied for the email template.

2+^| *Tab: Settings*

| *Owner*
|If the name of the owner has already been selected from the drop-down list upon creation of the email template, the name of the owner is displayed here. Otherwise, select the owner from the drop-down list. This setting can be changed at any time. +
*All* = The template is saved under *General email templates*. +
Own user name = The template is saved under *General email templates*. +
Other user name = The template is saved under *Email templates from other users*. +
*_Note:_* You have to be logged into the system as a user in order to create your own email templates under *My email templates*.

| *Name*
|If the name has already been entered upon creation of the email template, the name of the email template is displayed here. Otherwise, enter the name for the template.
The name can be changed at any time. The name is not displayed to the recipient.

| *Content*
|Select whether the content of the email template should be saved as *plain text* or in *HTML format*. +
*_Tip:_* Use text in HTML format. The link for order processing that is shown via the template function `{%Link_Checkout()%}` can be very long. Pure text emails can lead to line breaks that can damage the link. +
*_Important:_* If you add further languages in HTML format, pay attention that the setting *Only in HTML format* is selected in the drop-down list *Content* in the *Settings* tab. The selection *Plain text only* is the standard setting for all languages.

| *Template type*
|Select for which area the email template should be available. Possible options: *All* (default setting), *Order*, *Customers*, *Online store*, *Ticket* or *Scheduler*. +
*All* / *Online store* = The email template is available for all areas. +
*Order* = The email template is only available for the selected area. The template is not visible in the other areas. If the ticket is linked with an order, email templates with the template type *Order* can also be selected in the ticket. +
*Customers* = The email template is only available for the selected area. The template is not visible in the other areas. +
*Ticket* = The email template is only available for the selected area. The template is not visible in the other areas. +
*Scheduler* = The email template is available for all areas where the template type *Order* is visible.

| *PDF attachment*
|Select the attachment from the drop-down list. The documents that can be selected from this drop-down list are for example generated in the *Orders » Fulfilment* menu or through shipment-related processes. +
Currently available attachments: Adjustment form, credit note, delivery note, dunning letter, entry certificate, invoice, multi-credit note, multi-invoice, offer, OpenTrans (XML), order confirmation, pick-up delivery, PO delivery note, pro forma invoice, purchase order (CSV), purchase order (PDF), receipt, repair slip, return label, reversal document, reversal document and new invoice, reversal refund, reversal refund and new credit note, SEPA direct debit mandate, shipping label, voucher. +
*_Note:_* It is possible to send return labels of all shipping service providers that are integrated in plentymarkets – be it as plugin or as permanent integration.

| *Document attachment*
|Documents that were uploaded under *CMS » Documents* are displayed here. You can attach one of these documents to an email template. +
All email templates can be sent with up to 2 attachments in a standardised way: Use email templates to send PDF documents relating to fulfilment (e.g. invoices) or other files (e.g. brochures or instructions). For example, it would be useful to attach PDF documents of your cancellation rights and terms and conditions to the email template *Confirmation of online store order*.

| *Reply to*
|Enter an email address. If someone replies to the email template, their message is sent to this address. If no email address was entered, replies to the template are sent to the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#100[email address that is saved] under *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Login details*. For example, it is useful to enter the accounting department's email address for the *PDF invoice* email template. Questions about the invoice would then directly be sent to your accounting department and wouldn't have to be forwarded to them in an extra step.

| *Use design*
|Activate if the content of the email should be sent with the design that was saved under *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » HTML design*. If the option is not activated, only the content of the email template is used.

| *Client (store)*
|Activate one, multiple or *ALL* clients (stores). The email template is only valid for the selected clients (stores).

2+^| *Tab: Email message*

| *Select language*
|If required, select another language from the drop-down list. +
*_Note:_* The set language in the contact data record determines in which language the email template is sent.

| *Subject*
|Enter the subject text. Choose the subject carefully so that the emails are recognised by the email account and displayed in the contact's inbox instead of their spam folder.

| *Content / Item list*
|It is not possible to use global template variables in the *Content* tab, all order-related, contact-related and address-related template variables. +
In the *Item list* tab, only template variables that contain values of order items can be used. If these variables were used in the *Content* tab, they would be empty and no content would be shown. +
In these tabs, enter the text respectively the item list as *plain text* or in *HTML format* as well as the template variables and template functions.  +
*_Note:_* Check which type of content was selected in the *Settings* tab under *Content*. Enter the text of the email into this corresponding tab. For example, if *Plain text only* is selected but you entered content into the *Text in HTML format* tab, this content is not sent in the email.

|====

[TIP]
.Tip: Use text in HTML format
====
plentymarkets recommends that you use text which was formatted with HTML because the link for order processing can be very long. Pure text emails can lead to line breaks that might damage the link. Furthermore, if you use HTML-formatted text, you have the possibility to format the text by means of the integrated HTML editor.

Go to *Setup » Settings » Editors* and determine which editors should be available for certain areas in your plentymarkets system. Select the *editor*, *syntax editor* or *text field*.

=== Using template variables and template functions

Have a look at the following video tutorial and get to know template variables and if constructs in plentymarkets:

[[video-template-variables-if-constructs]]
.Getting to know template variables and if constructs in plentymarkets
video::214974549[vimeo, width=640, height=360]

Template variables and template functions can be used in email templates. In place of the variable or the function, your plentymarkets system automatically displays the content that this variable or function represents. In this way, only the content is displayed in the email. If you use the xref:crm:using-the-ticket-system.adoc#4800[ticket system], some template variables can also be used as assignment parameters.

Open an email template in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu to display a list of all template variables and template functions that are available for your email templates.

For an overview of the template variables and template functions for email templates, refer to the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#4000[Template variables and template functions available for email templates] chapter.

[TIP]
.Order processing link
====
If you would like that your customers can inform themselves about the current state of the orders, insert the template function `Link_Checkout()` in the email template. In order that the URL is correctly translated, you have to insert the template function into the email template as follows: `{%Link_Checkout()%}`.

*_Note:_* The email template *Confirmation of online store order* does _not_ automatically contain the template function `{%Link_Checkout()%}`.
====

[#1400]
=== Configuring the display of variations

You can individually set up the how the order item lines are structured for each email template and language. xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1500[If queries] can also be used for the configuration of variations. If you do not set up how the variations should be displayed, plentymarkets displays a standard list of the variations.

[IMPORTANT]
.Add template variable $OrderProperties in the item list
====
The template variable `$OrderProperties` that displays the order properties is not contained in the standard list of the variations in the email templates of the template type *Order*. This means that order properties are not displayed in the variations. If you would like that the order properties are contained in the item list, you have to manually add the template variable `$OrderProperties`.
====

[.instruction]
Configuring the display of variations:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates*.
. Open the template.
. Click on the *Email message* tab. +
→ The *Content* tab appears.
. Insert the template variable `$ItemListHTML `in the tab Text in *HTML format* or the template variable `$ItemListPlain` in the tab *Plain text* in the email's *Content* tab. Position the template variable where you would like the variations to be displayed.
. Copy the template variable from the overview that you need for the variations and add the template variable to the tab *Item list*. +
→ To help with the formatting, for example, you can insert tabs that you copied from a text program between the template variables (see <<#image-crm-available-template-variables-item-list-part1>> and <<#image-crm-available-template-variables-item-list-part2>>).
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[discrete]
==== Example: Displaying variations

Insert the template variables to display the item ID (`$ItemID`), the item name (`$ItemName`) and the item price (`$ItemPrice`) of the variations. The display begins with a hyphen. This is used at the start of each new line, even if multiple variations are shown. In order for the display to "work" on multiple lines, insert a line break at the end of the line by pressing Enter.

How you open the preview in order to check the email template is described in the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1600[Checking the email template using the preview function] chapter.

[#1500]
Using if queries in email templates

Use if queries in email templates to display specific information on a case-by-case basis. For example, you can save a code that causes bank details to only be displayed in the email to the contact if cash in advance (ID{nbsp}={nbsp}0) was selected as the payment method. This if query can be found in the following example.

.Email log entries in case of an error
--

The *Email* process in the *Data » API log (deprecated)* menu contains error messages that relate to emails, e.g. when emails cannot be sent or when email accounts or addresses are not configured correctly. The process is added to the drop-down list when such an error occurs for the first time. The following information is displayed in an error message, e.g. if an email could not be sent: customer ID, order ID and the provider's error message. This information is also displayed in the log entry.

*How to filter API log entries*

By default, entries are sorted by their ID. You can filter the entries so that fewer search results are included in the list. An API name filter and a date filter are available for this purpose. It is possible to combine both filters so that only entries for a specific format and day are displayed.

[.instruction]
Filtering log entries by name:

. Go to *Data » API log*.
. Select a format from the *Process* drop-down list.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="darkGrey"]).

[IMPORTANT]
.The desired format is not displayed?
======
The formats are not displayed in the *Process* drop-down list until the process has been carried out once and has therefore been logged. If you do not find new formats in this list, the process has not been carried out yet or the error you are looking for has not yet occurred.
======

[.instruction]
Filtering log entries by date:

. Go to *Data » API log*.
. Select a *Date* from the calendar.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="darkGrey"]).

=== Sending ticket messages and comments as emails

An xref:crm:using-the-ticket-system.adoc#2100[email account] has to be saved in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Email accounts* menu in order for messages and comments to be sent as emails. You also have to set up an email template that displays the last ticket message or comment. This email template has to be linked to an xref:crm:using-the-ticket-system.adoc#2900[event procedure] in order for messages and comments to be sent via email. For further information, refer to the xref:crm:using-the-ticket-system.adoc#2100[Ticket system] page of the manual.

[#2000]
=== Sending coupons via email

You can send coupons and coupon codes via email. Simply attach them to emails as PDF files. For further information, refer to the chapters xref:orders:coupons.adoc#coupon-codes-email[Inserting coupon codes directly into emails] and xref:orders:coupons.adoc#configure-coupon-template[Configuring coupon templates] on the xref:orders:coupons.adoc#[Coupons] page of the manual.

[#2300]
== Setting up the automatic email despatch

The *Setup» Client » [Select client] » Email » Automatic* menu contains various events that can be linked with an email template. Select the email template that you have previously xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[created] in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu from the drop-down list. This ensures that the email template is sent to your contact once the event occurs.

[IMPORTANT]
.Removing the link before deleting the email template
====
Deleting an email template that is linked with an event in the *Automatic email* area may lead to undesired effects. Therefore, first go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Automatic* and remove the link by selecting the option *Do not send* from the drop-down list in the line of the event. Afterwards, you delete the email template in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu.
====

Learn in the following video tutorial how you link your email templates with fixed events and set up event procedures for the automatic email despatch:

[.instruction]
Setting up the automatic email despatch:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Automatic*.
. Select an email template from the drop-down list in the line of the event. Note <<#table-events-automatic-email-despatch>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

<<#table-events-automatic-email-despatch>> lists explanations of some of the events.

.Explanations about some events for the automatic despatch
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *New order from online store*
|The contacts receive an email including the order confirmation after the purchase has been completed in the online shop. +
*_Note_:* If you want that your customer can access the order processing in your online shop with this email to see the order status, you have to insert the template function `{%Link_Checkout()%}` in the email template that you select for this automatic event.

| *Send customer email to change password*
|The contacts receive an email with a link to the new password. The link has to be actively confirmed. The template function `{% Link_ChangePassword() %}` has to be included in the email template.

| *Newsletter opt-in*
|The contacts receive an email when they have registered for the newsletter. The email template should include the confirmation link that the contacts have to click in order to complete the newsletter registration process.

| *Newsletter opt-in confirmation*
|The contacts receive a confirmation email once they have activated the confirmation link that was sent with the email template for the *Newsletter opt-in* event.

| *Reminder in case of aborted purchase*
|The contacts receive a reminder email that one or multiple items are in the shopping cart, but the purchase has not been completed yet. It also makes sense for the email template to include a link to the shopping cart. Contacts can then click on this link to complete their order. Simply insert your online shop's URL with the suffix */basket/* (example: *+https://www.myshop.co.uk/basket/+*). +
The only requirement is that potential customers were registered and logged into your online shop. Otherwise the email address is not available and the email template cannot be sent automatically. +
*_Important:_* Due to missing previous consent of the recipient, this kind of email despatch can be considered to be unsolicited message (spam). Therefore, it is recommended to ask a specialised solicitor.

| *Registration for sweepstakes*
|The contacts that have registered for the sweepstake receive a confirmation email.

| *Email when item becomes available*
|The contacts receive an email containing the information that a certain item is available again. Requirement: The contacts have entered their email address in the online shop directly next to the item that could not be delivered at that time.

=== Automatic email despatch taking a new order on eBay as an example

An order is automatically created in plentymarkets after a contact has purchased an item on eBay. If you have xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[created] the email template "Order confirmation eBay" for example and selected this template from the drop-down list for the event *New order from eBay* in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Automatic* menu, an email is automatically sent to the contact.

Along with the automatic email despatch, a message can also be sent to the contact via the eBay messaging system. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings*. Click on the *Account settings* tab and save the text in the sub-menu *Message after purchase*. For further information, refer to the xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#1500[Sending messages after purchase] chapter on the xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#[Setting up eBay] page of the manual.

[discrete]
=== Setting up an event procedure

It is also possible to set up event procedures in the *Setup » Orders » Events* menu. Define an event, activate one or more filters and decide which procedures your plentymarkets system should carry out automatically when the event occurs.

For example, you can use filters to trigger a procedure once a contact has placed a certain number of orders. The procedure could send an email that includes a coupon. For further information, refer to the xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedures] page of the manual.

[#2500]
== Displaying sent email templates for each contact

Go to *Orders » Edit orders » [Open order] » Tab: Email » Tab: Emails sent*. There you can display all email templates that you have ever sent to the contact. Note that only those email templates that are linked to a unique contact ID are displayed in this tab.

[.instruction]
Displaying sent email templates for each contact:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the order.
. Click on the *Mail* tab.
. Click on the *Emails sent* tab. +
→ The date, time, email address of the recipient, ID and name of the template as well as the order ID are displayed.

Expand the area *Other emails sent to this customer...* to display all emails that have been sent to the contact. Here you can also see those emails that were sent to the contact from another order. Click on the order ID on the right-hand side. The order overview of the order opens in a separate tab.

[#2600]
== Displaying all sent email templates

Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Statistics* to create a new statistic. Select the statistic type *Sent email templates* in the *Orders* area. This statistic shows information about the emails sent with your plentymarkets system according to the ID and the name of the email template. This statistical feedback is made for each date within the selected time span. The standard setting of the time span is the last 30 days. You can also adapt the time span or select a start date and an end date.

In this statistic, you can see for example which email template was used during the selected time period. This helps you to easily recognise which processes were carried out on a regular basis. For further information, refer to the xref:business-decisions:statistics.adoc#[Statistics] page of the manual.

=== Template variables

Template variables are pre-defined variables that can be inserted in email templates. When sending the emails, this variable is automatically filled with the corresponding content. Template variables start with a dollar sign (`$`) followed by an upper-case character. <<#table-template-variables-emails>> lists the template variables that are available for email templates.


[TIP]
.Template variable logic
====
Note that template variables can only be filled with content when certain requirements are met.

Examples:

* `$TicketLastMessage` is only filled with content when an event procedure was set up that reacts to a new ticket message
* `$OrderId` is only filled and sent in combination with orders. For example, if the "Forgot password" function is used, the system would not know which order ID to use because the reference to an order is missing.
