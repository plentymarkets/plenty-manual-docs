Do you want to easily and quickly create new contacts with an individually adjustable user interface, e.g. during a phone call?

The user interface to create a new contact allows a high degree of flexibility for positioning content and data. This works by intuitively positioning areas for content and elements on the dashboard via drag-and-drop. Each area and each element can be further edited by clicking on *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]) in the top right of the contact data record. <<#table-functions-new-contact>> contains an overview on the functions available in the editing mode of contact data record.

| *Allow invoice* / *Allow debit*
|If you have already allowed the two payment methods *Invoice* and *Debit* in the xref:crm:preparatory-settings.adoc#create-customer-class[customer class], you _don’t_ need to carry out any settings here. Because: The settings in the customer class have priority over the settings in the contact data record. +

icon:check-square[role="blue"] = The contact can pay using this payment method, even if you do _not_ offer this payment method in your plentyShop. +

*_Example:_* A contact who has bought in your online shop multiple times, should be allowed to buy items on invoice. +

Necessary settings: +
- Go to *Setup » Orders » Payment » Payment methods* and activate the payment method so it is available in the order. +
*_Important:_* Make sure that no countries of delivery were saved in the settings of the payment method. Otherwise, the payment method would be available to all customers in your plentyShop, which is not desired in this case. +

- The second requirement is that the payment method *Invoice* or *Debit* has to be available in at least one shipping profile, i.e. the payment method may _not_ be blocked. +

- Activate the shipping profile for the items. +

Check the necessary settings that are listed here and activate the payment method. This allows the contact to use the payment method.

[#preselected-fields-new-contact]
[discrete]
== Fields that are automatically preselected when creating a new contact

When you create a new contact, some fields are already preselected. You can of course adjust these fields before saving the new contact data record. The following lists the preselected fields:

* In the address details:
** the address type *Invoice address*
** the country *Germany* (this depends on the selected default setting in the system)

* In the contact details:
** the type *Customer* (this is the type with the lowest ID in the *Setup » CRM » Types* menu)
** the customer class with the lowest position that you saved in the *Setup » CRM » Customer classes* menu
** the default client (shop)
** the language *German* (this depends on the selected default setting in the system)

[#duplicate-check-create-contact]
== Duplicate check for contact data records with identical email address

When creating new and updating existing contact data records, the email address is checked in order to avoid duplicate entries in the system.

The logic works in the following way:

* When creating a new contact, the system searches for an existing regular contact with identical private email address. If a contact is found, this contact is updated with the new data. If _no_ contact is found, a new regular contact is created.

* When updating the private email address of an existing regular contact, the system searches if another regular contact with the same private email address exists. If this is the case, the private email address of the current contact is _not_ updated. All other data, however, is updated.
