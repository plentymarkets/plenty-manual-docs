Do you want to easily and quickly create new contacts with an individually adjustable user interface, for example during a phone call? First of all, create a <<#create-view, new view>> according to your needs.

[#create-view]
== Creating a view

The user interface to create a new contact allows a high degree of flexibility for positioning content and data. This works by intuitively positioning areas for content and elements on the dashboard via drag-and-drop. Each area and each element can be further edited by clicking on *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]) in the top right of the contact data record. <<#table-functions-new-contact>> contains an overview on the functions available in the editing mode of contact data record.

[#preselected-fields-new-contact]
== Automatically preselected fields

When you create a new contact, some fields are already preselected. You can of course adjust these fields before saving the new contact data record. The following lists the preselected fields:

* In the address details:
** the address type *Invoice address*
** the country that you saved as default location in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Settings* menu

* In the contact details:
** the type *Customer* (this is the type with the lowest ID in the *Setup » CRM » Types* menu)
** the customer class with the lowest position that you saved in the *Setup » CRM » Customer classes* menu
** the default client (shop)
** the language *German* (this depends on the selected default setting in the system)

[#duplicate-check-create-contact]
[discrete]
== Duplicate check for contact data records with identical email address

When creating new and updating existing contact data records, the email address is checked in order to avoid duplicate entries in the system.

The logic works in the following way:

* When creating a new contact, the system searches for an existing regular contact with identical private email address. If a contact is found, this contact is updated with the new data. If _no_ contact is found, a new regular contact is created.

* When updating the private email address of an existing regular contact, the system searches if another regular contact with the same private email address exists. If this is the case, the private email address of the current contact is _not_ updated. All other data, however, is updated.
