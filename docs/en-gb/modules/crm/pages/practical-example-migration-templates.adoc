:keywords: migration mail templates, migration old email templates, migration template EmailBuilder
:description: This practical example describes which settings you need to carry out in the EmailBuilder after the migration of the old email templates.
:author: team-crm

With just some clicks, you can migrate the “old” email templates that you created in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu to the EmailBuilder or you can create the xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#use-default-templates[default templates] from the EmailBuilder again.

[#migration-how]
== How do I migrate the templates?

You can either migrate one single, old template to the EmailBuilder or migrate all old templates at once. Moreover, you can create the default templates again in case you deleted them.

[#migration-in-emailbuilder]
=== EmailBuilder

In the *CRM » EmailBuilder* menu, we added 2 new buttons in the EmailBuilder that you can use to carry out the following actions:

* <<#migrate-all-old-templates, Migrate all old templates>>
* <<#create-default-templates-again, Create all default templates again>> in case you deleted them

[#migration-old-email-template-menu]

In the old email templates settings in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu, we added a button to each template that you can use to migrate the selected template to the EmailBuilder.

Migrating a single template:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates*.

→ A window opens and you need to confirm your decision.
. Click on *Yes*. +
→ The template is migrated to the EmailBuilder. You can find the template in the *Old templates* folder and then in the sub-folder of the owner name if an owner is assigned to the template, or in the sub-folder *General* if no owner is assigned to the template.

[TIP]
.Checking the content of the migrated templates
====
After the migration, it is necessary to check the <<#content-migrated-templates, content of the migrated template>>. If errors occur during the migration, the faulty content will be highlighted in red font within the template. Correct the error and insert variables, if needed.

[#what-to-check]
== What do I have to check and where?

After the migration, you should check the <<#content-migrated-templates, content>> of the templates and the <<#check-linked-templates, automated processes>> where you linked an email template such as event procedures in plentymarkets.

[#content-migrated-templates]
=== Checking the content of the migrated templates

After you carried out the migration <<#migration-how, in your system>>, it’s important to check the content of the migrated templates in the *CRM » EmailBuilder* menu. To do so, open the preview of the corresponding templates (material:preview[]).

Especially when you created complex templates in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu that contain for example xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#4100[template functions] or nested if statements, it is important to check that the migration has correctly transferred all content to the EmailBuilder.

If needed, you might add xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#[EmailBuilder variables] to the migrated templates in the EmailBuilder.

[#check-linked-templates]
=== Checking the linked email templates

After having checked the <<#content-migrated-templates, content of the migrated templates>>, it is also required that you check all menus in your plentymarkets system where you linked email templates that are sent in an automated way.  

Depending on which automation option in plentymarkets you are using, check the following menus:

* xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[Event procedures] in the *Setup » Orders » Events* menu
* xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#automatic-email-despatch[Automatic despatch] in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* menu » Assistant: *Email accounts* » Step: *Automatic despatch*
* xref:automation:processes.adoc#200[Processes] in the *Setup » Processes* menu
* xref:automation:procedure-manager.adoc#[Procedure manager] in the *Setup » Orders » Procedures* menu
* xref:crm:using-the-ticket-system.adoc#2900[Ticket event procedures] in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Events* menu
* Ticket procedure manager in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Procedures* menu

[#migrated-templates-where]
== Where can I find the migrated templates?

The migrated templates are available in the *CRM » EmailBuilder* menu in the main folder *Old templates* in the corresponding sub-folders.

_Example_: After the migration, all templates that were created by the owner plentytest are available in the sub-folder *plentytest*. All other templates that do not belong to a certain owner (General email templates) are then available in the EmailBuilder’s *General* folder (see <<#image-migration-old-templates-folder>>).

[#migrated-templates-how]
== How can I find my “old” templates?

During the migration, we put the ID of the old template in brackets behind the name of the new template. The quickest way to find your “old” templates that you created in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu is to enter the ID in the *Name* field of the search.
