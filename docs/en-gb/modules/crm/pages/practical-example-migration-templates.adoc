With the release of the new EmailBuilder version on 7th September2022 in all beta systems, all “old” email templates that you have created in the past in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu, have been migrated automatically to the EmailBuilder. Also the structure and the variables from the old templates have been transferred.

[#what-to-check]
== What do I have to check and where?

[#content-migrated-templates]
=== Checking the content of the migrated templates

After the migration has been carried out also <<#box-migration-dates, in your system>>, it’s important that you check the content of the migrated templates in the *CRM » EmailBuilder (Test phase)* menu. To do so, open the preview of the corresponding templates (material:preview[]).

Especially when you created complex templates in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu that contain for example xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#4100[template functions], it is important to check that the migration has correctly transferred all content to the EmailBuilder.

If needed, you might add xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#[EmailBuilder variables] to the migrated templates in the EmailBuilder.

[#check-linked-templates]
=== Checking the linked email templates

After having checked the <<#content-migrated-templates, content of the migrated templates>>, it is also required that you check all menus in your plentymarkets system where you linked email templates that are sent in an automated way.  

Depending on which automation option in plentymarkets you are using, check the following menus:

* xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[Event procedures] in the *Setup » Orders » Events* menu
* xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#automatic-email-despatch[Automatic despatch] in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* menu in the *Email accounts* assistant
* xref:automation:processes.adoc#200[Processes] in the *Setup » Processes* menu
* xref:automation:procedure-manager.adoc#[Procedure manager] in the *Setup » Orders » Procedures* menu
* xref:crm:using-the-ticket-system.adoc#2900[Ticket event procedures] in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Events* menu
* Ticket procedure manager in the *Setup » CRM » Ticket system » Procedures* menu

[#migrated-templates]
== Where can I find the migrated templates?

The migrated templates are available in the *CRM » EmailBuilder (Test phase)* menu in the main folder *Old templates* in the corresponding sub-folders.

_Example_: After the migration, all templates that were created by the owner plentytest are available in the sub-folder *plentytest*. All other templates that do not belong to a certain owner (General email templates) are then available in the EmailBuilder’s *General* folder (see <<#image-migration-old-templates-folder>>).

== How can I find my “old” templates?

During the migration, we put the ID of the old template in brackets behind the name of the new template. The quickest way to find your “old” templates that you created in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu is to enter the ID in the *Name* field of the search.
