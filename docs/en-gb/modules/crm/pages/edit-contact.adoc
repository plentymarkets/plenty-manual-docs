xref:crm:create-contact.adoc#[icon:long-arrow-left[] Creating a contact]

'''

Once you have xref:crm:create-contact.adoc#[created] a contact, you can add further details to the <<#details-individual-areas, various areas of the contact data record>>. To do so, you can <<#edit-view, create your own view>> or use one of the <<#default-views-templates, templates>> that are available in your system by default.

Note also the <<#group-function, group function>> that you can use to easily and quickly carry out different actions for multiple contacts at once.

[#edit-view]
== Creating a view

The user interface to edit a contact allows a high degree of flexibility for positioning content and data. This works by intuitively positioning areas for content and elements on the dashboard via drag-and-drop. Each area and each element can be further edited by clicking on *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]) in the top right of the contact data record. <<#table-functions-edit-contact>> contains an overview on the functions available in the editing mode of the contact data record.

If you want to offer different prices to end customers and sellers in the plentyShop, this can be done with the *Display of the prices in the online store* option in the settings of the customer class. It is very common that gross prices are shown for end customers (B2C) in the plentyShop and net prices for sellers (B2B). +
*_Note:_* This field was already preselected when the contact was created. You can of course adjust the value here.

| *Contact not blocked*
|By default, the contact is not blocked (icon:toggle_on[set=material, role=darkGrey]). This means that the contact is _not_ blocked for the selected client and is able to log into your plentyShop. +
If you click on the button (icon:toggle_off[set=material, role=red]), the contact is blocked. This means that the contact is _blocked_ for the selected client and is _not_ able to log into your plentyShop.

| *Allow invoice* / *Allow debit*
|If you have already allowed the two payment methods *Invoice* and *Debit* in the xref:crm:preparatory-settings.adoc#create-customer-class[customer class], you _don’t_ need to carry out any settings here. Because: The settings in the customer class have priority over the settings in the contact data record. +

*_Example:_* A contact who has bought in your online shop multiple times, should be allowed to buy items on invoice. +

Necessary settings: +
- Go to *Setup » Orders » Payment » Payment methods* and activate the xref:payment:managing-payment-methods.adoc#65[payment method] so it is available in the order. +
*_Important:_* Make sure that _no_ countries of delivery were saved in the settings of the payment method. Otherwise, the payment method would be available to all customers in your plentyShop, which is not desired in this case. +

- The payment method *Invoice* or *Debit* has to be available in at least one xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1000[shipping profile], i.e. the payment method may _not_ be blocked in the shipping profile. +

- Activate the shipping profile for the items. +

Check the necessary settings that are listed here and activate (icon:toggle_on[set=material, role=skyBlue]) the payment method. This allows the contact to use the payment method.

[#convert-guest-to-regular-account]
== Converting a guest order into a regular contact data record

In general, you can recognise a guest order by the symbol (icon:done[set=material]) in the *Guest* column in the overview.

To be able to work GDPR-compliant, _no_ contact data record with a contact ID is created in case of guest orders that come into your systems via plentyShop LTS. plentyShop guest orders can therefore _not_ be found via the *CRM » Contacts* menu because they are basically not a contact. The data from the plentyShop guest order can only be found via the address data in the *CRM » Quick search* menu. Also in this menu, you can convert a guest order into a regular contact data record.

Guest orders coming into your system via a marketplace receive a contact ID. This is why you can convert a marketplace guest order into a regular contact data record also in the contact data record in the *CRM » Contacts* menu. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Converting a guest order into a regular contact data record:

. Go to *CRM » Contacts*.
. Search for the contact by means of the filter settings. Note the explanations about the filters on the xref:crm:search-contact.adoc#[Searching for a contact] page. +
→ The contacts that correspond to the search criteria entered are displayed.
. Click in the line of the contact to open the data record.
. Click on *Options* on the left side. +
→ In the *Options* area, you can the entry *Access, guest* with the value *1*. 1 means that it’s a guest.
. Click in the line *Access, guest* on icon:close[set=material] to remove the option.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=material]) the settings. +
→ The guest has been converted into a contact data record. The symbol icon:done[set=material] is removed from the *Guest* column in the overview.  +
*_Note:_* If you cannot see the change immediately, it might be necessary to reload the *CRM » Contacts* menu. 

icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] Send an email to the contact and inform them that the guest order was converted into a regular contact data record. They can then create a password to be able to log into your plentyShop.

Further information about converting plentyShop and marketplace guest orders into regular contact data records can be found on the xref:crm:quick-search.adoc#[Quick search] page in the xref:crm:quick-search.adoc#convert-guest-account[Converting a plentyShop and marketplace guest order into a contact data record] chapter.

[#duplicate-check-update-contact]
== Duplicate check for contact data records with identical email address

When creating new and updating existing contact data records, the email address is checked in order to avoid duplicate entries in the system.

The logic works in the following way:

* When creating a new contact, the system searches for an existing regular contact with identical private email address. If a contact is found, this contact is updated with the new data. If _no_ contact is found, a new regular contact is created.

* When updating the private email address of an existing regular contact, the system searches if another regular contact with the same private email address exists. If this is the case, the private email address of the current contact is _not_ updated. All other data, however, is updated.

[#change-history-contact-data]
== Showing the change history for contact data

Via the change history you can track which user has changed data of a contact data record at which time in your system. Furthermore, it is displayed if the contact have made changes in the My account area of your online shop.

[.instruction]
Showing the change history for contact data:

. Go to *Data » CRM Change History*.
. Select an option from the drop-down list *Reference type*.
. Enter the reference ID, e.g. the ID of the contact.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ A list of changes with the old and new values, the change date as well as the name and ID of the user who did the changes appears.

For further information, refer to the xref:data:change-history.adoc#1300[CRM Change history] chapter on the xref:data:change-history.adoc#[Tracking changes] page.

[#check-vat-number]
== Checking the VAT number

The value added tax identification number (VAT number) is an exclusive identification number and serves to designate VAT registered individuals. Within the EU, tax offices need this number for VAT accounting purposes. The VAT check via the European Commission allows you to verify German and international VAT numbers. These checks can be carried out daily from 5:00 a.m. to 11 p.m. CET.

Checking the VAT number in the plentymarkets back end is not possible. You can, however, download a plugin in the plentyMarketplace, e.g. the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/vatidcheck_6023[VAT ID Check^] to carry out the VAT ID check.

[#vat-number-plentyshop]
=== Checking the VAT number in the plentyShop

The VAT number is automatically checked in the plentyShop during the order process. If an invalid VAT number was entered, the customer is only able to complete their order once a valid VAT number has been entered or once the entry has been deleted.

[#export-check-data]
=== Exporting check data

You can export a list of all the check data or the data for the current month. For further information about exporting the VAT number check data, refer to the xref:data:exporting-data.adoc#[Exporting data] page.

[#contact-data-export-import]
== Exporting, importing and updating contact data

Go to *Data » Elastic export* to export the data of your contacts. To do so, it is required to install and deploy the plugins link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/formatdesigner_6483[FormatDesigner^] and link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/markets/ElasticExport_4763[Elastic Export^]. Both plugins are available in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/[plentyMarketplace^]. +

Create the format for the export in the *Data » FormatDesigner* menu. Create a new export in the *Data » Elastic export* menu. Select the format that you have just created via the FormatDesigner from the drop-down list. Afterwards, export the data to a CSV file.

Various filter options are available for the export. You can export, for example, only contacts that you have rated with 3 stars or only contacts that are assigned to a certain owner.

Import or update the data of your contacts including address options, contact options and account data via the import tool. To do so, use the import type xref:data:elasticSync-contacts.adoc#[Contacts, companies and addresses]. For further information, refer to the xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[Using the import tool] page of the manual.
