Use the quick search to get an overview of all information that is saved for a contact or an address data record of a guest order. Learn on this page of the manual how to <<download-all-data#, download all data of a contact or guest order>> and how to <<anonymise-data-record#, anonymise data records>> in compliance with GDPR.

[NOTE]
.Guest accounts via the plentyShop can only be found in the quick search
====
In order to be able to work GDPR-compliant, no contact data record is created in case of guest orders via the plentyShop. Only the address data is saved. This data that is saved in your plentymarkets system can therefore not be found in the *CRM » Contacts* menu. The address data of the person who ordered as a guest can only be found via the address data in the quick search. +

Further information about converting plentyShop guest orders into regular contact data records can be found in the <<convert-guest-account#, Converting a guest account into a contact data record>> chapter.
