[#variables-in-expert-mode]
== Inserting variables in expert mode

If you are in expert mode within the template (see <<#image-emailbuilder-expert-mode-dark-mode>>), you can view the variable list by simply clicking on material:list[] (*Show variables*). 

In the *Search* field, enter the name of the variable or expand the different categories to search for the variables. +
If you have found the desired variable in the list, click on it once to copy the corresponding twig expression to the clipboard.

Now navigate with your mouse to the desired location in your template where you want to insert the content. Insert the content that you have copied to the clipboard by using the key combination Strg+v or cmd+v. +
*_Note:_* Because you are in expert mode, the corresponding twig expression will be inserted and _not_ the variable name.
