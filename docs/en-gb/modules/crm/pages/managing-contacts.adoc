[#13]
=== Setting up the address layout for delivery notes

In the *Setup » CRM » Address layout* menu, you can individually set up address layouts for your countries of delivery for the order document *Delivery note*. The address layouts for the countries of delivery German, France and the United Kingdom are already available in your plentymarkets system by default. You can edit these 3 address layouts if you have the corresponding rights to do this.

| *Countries*
|Select one country or multiple countries from the list to which the address layout should apply.

| *Layout* / +
*Fields*
|Drag the address fields from the *Fields* area to the *Layout* area. By doing so, you individually design the address layout for each country. +
*_Tip:_* It is possible to add further rows (maximum number of rows:{nbsp}6) and to remove individual fields and complete rows. Blank rows can also be used. The number of fields per row is not limited.

|====

In order that the address layouts are automatically displayed on delivery notes, you have to carry out a setting in the delivery note. Your plentymarkets system automatically checks the country of delivery saved in the order and displays the delivery note in the layout listed in the *Setup » CRM » Address layout* menu. Proceed as described below.

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Delivery note*.
. Select the option *New address layout* in the *Basic settings:{nbsp}Delivery note* area. +
→ The option above *Structure of the invoice/delivery address* is hidden and the delivery notes are displayed in the address layouts listed in the *Setup » CRM » Address layout* menu.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

How to create delivery notes is described on the <<orders/order-documents/generating-delivery-notes#, Generating delivery notes>> page of the manual.

Currently, this setting is only available for delivery notes. This setting will follow for further documents.

[#15]
=== Creating a customer class

Use customer classes to categorise your customer base according to specific criteria. For example, you can create a customer class for consumers (B2C) that displays gross prices for the items in your online shop. For sellers (B2B), you create another customer class that displays net prices for the items in your online shop. Further options are discounts based on the net value of your items, discounts based on the payment method or discount scales for a selected customer class.

*_Note:_* If a contact registers in your plentyShop and selects the salutation *Company*, the customer class that you created for B2B contacts will apply automatically.

[TIP]
.Tip: Create types and classes
====
It is recommended to create a concept for organising your customer base into types and classes before saving customer data. By doing this, you will save time later on. For example, types and classes are automatically assigned when the initial configuration is missing. Decide which types and classes you need, create them and assign them to the customers.
====

You can create and individually configure as many customer classes as you like in the *Setup » CRM » Classes* menu. An ID is automatically assigned to customer classes. This ID is displayed to the left of the customer classes' name in the overview. However, customer classes are not ordered by ID. Instead, the order is set using the option *Position*.

If a new customer class is created, the customer class is available in the detail view of the contact in the *CRM » Contacts » [Open contact]* menu.

[.instruction]
Creating a customer class:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.
. Click on the *New customer class* tab.
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-create-customer-class>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-create-customer-class]]
.Creating a customer class
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|[#intable-customer-class-minimum-order-value]*Minimum order value*
|Enter the minimum order quantity if you want to require customers to order a specific quantity of items or if you want to require them to order a minimum quantity to get a discount.

|[#intable-customer-class-name]*Name*
|Enter a name for the new customer class, e.g. *wholesaler* or *premium customer*.

|[#intable-customer-class-position]*Position*
|If you do not enter a position, the next available position number is assigned automatically. The position is primarily used to sort the customer classes in the menu. It is relevant e.g. in combination with the visibility of item prices in the online shop. This can be set under *Display of the prices in the online store*.

|[#intable-customer-class-payment-due-date]*Payment due date, percentage for early payment discount, days for early payment discount and valuta*
|Payment due date, percentage for early payment discount, days for early payment discount and valuta are the terms of payment. +
*_Important:_* The terms of payment that are saved in the contact data record have priority over the values entered here. +
The terms of payment are saved in the <<orders/managing-orders#intable-payment-terms-order, order settings>>. The values in the contact data record have also priority over the values in the order settings. The values can be manually adjusted or entered in the order if no values are saved in the contact data record or in the customer class. The terms of payment saved in the order are then shown on the <<orders/order-documents#intable-payment-terms-documents, documents>>. Pay attention to the expandable box *Example:{nbsp}terms of payment* below <<#table-edit-contact>> in the <<crm/managing-contacts#300, Editing a contact>> chapter. You can find an example regarding the terms of payment there.

|[#intable-customer-class-customer-id]*Customer ID*
|Enter the ID of the contact who should receive the multi-invoices that are created from <<orders/managing-orders#800#, multi-orders>>. Multi-orders are generated for this customer class and the invoice is sent to that contact.

|[#intable-customer-class-discount-type]*Discount type*
|Select the discount type. The number of options that are visible depends on which discount type was selected. If you do no want to offer a discount, select the option *No discount*. Further information and explanations about the discount types in plentymarkets can be found in the <<crm/managing-contacts#25, Using the discount system>> chapter.

|[#intable-customer-class-volume-discount]*Volume discount*
|Select whether the value entered in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu under *Minimum quantity* should be taken into account or not.

|[#intable-customer-class-allowed-payment-methods]*Allowed payment methods*
|Select which of the payment methods that are available in the online shop should be permitted for this customer class. +
All of the available payment methods are selected by default. When you integrate new payment methods, you have to permit them here. This is because new payment methods are not automatically included in this list. +
*_Important:_* Pay attention to which <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, payment methods are blocked in the shipping profiles>> that you want to use for this customer class. Check those settings to make sure that they are compatible with the settings you make here. If you want to permit a payment method for a customer class, you should make sure it is _not_ blocked in the shipping profiles. Make sure that the corresponding customer class is _not_ blocked either.

|[#intable-customer-class-payment-instruction]*Payment instruction*
|The payment instructions that are saved here are displayed on invoices. For example, you could enter payment information that relates to a specific customer class.

|[#intable-customer-class-display-prices-online-store]*Display of the prices in the online store*
|Select whether *gross* or *net* prices are displayed in the online shop. +
*_Important:_* This option only sets how prices are displayed. It does not influence the way prices are calculated for the customer class. This option is particularly important for the customer class with position 1\. This customer class is automatically assigned to contacts if no customer class was selected in the contact data record.
|====

You can link sales prices with customer classes. Go to *Setup » Items » Sales prices* and select one of the customer classes that you created under the setting *Class*. For further information, refer to the <<item/settings/prices#100, Sales prices and price calculation>> page.

[#20]
=== Creating a type

Types are used to classify and differentiate contacts. Some types are available by default in your plentymarkets system and cannot be deleted. These types are *Customer*, *Sales representative*, *Supplier*, *Partners*, *Manufacturer* and *Interested party*. The types that you created are available in the *Filter* area in the *Type* drop-down list in the *CRM » Contacts* menu.

When creating a new contact data record, the type *Customer* is automatically set by default. Customers who were assigned to the type *Supplier* are available in certain drop-down lists, e.g. in a variation's *Supplier* tab.

Proceed as described below to create types.

[.instruction]
Creating a type:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Types*.

=== Using the discount system

In plentymarkets, you have various possibilities for offering discounts. You may give your customers a <<crm/managing-contacts#26, customer class discount>>, a <<crm/managing-contacts#28, discount based on the method of payment>> or a <<crm/managing-contacts#27, discount scale based on the net value of items>>. Furthermore, you can <<crm/managing-contacts#29, save sales prices as discounts>> and <<crm/managing-contacts#30, manually enter discounts>>. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes* to carry out the settings for the types of discounts. The following sub-chapters describe which settings you need to carry out in order to give discounts.

[#26]
==== Setting up a customer class discount

In a customer class, you determine discounts that are only effective for this customer class. Furthermore, you have further configuration possibilities, such as activating the sales price's volume discount. Make sure that the discounts can be added for each configuration.

Proceed as described below to save a discount for customer classes.

[.instruction]
Setting up a customer class discount:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.

. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

You find information about how to create customer classes in the <<crm/managing-contacts#15, Creating a customer class>> chapter.

[#27]
==== Setting up a discount scale based on the net value of items

If you would like to reward your customers with discounts when they make large purchases in your online shop, you can determine amounts that should be discounted based on the net value of items in the order.

[.instruction]
Setting up a discount scale based on the net value of items:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.
. Expand the customer class that the discount scale should be applied to (icon:plus-square-o[]).
. Select the option *Discount scale based on net value of items* as *Discount type*. +
→ A table with further settings opens.
. Enter monetary amounts under the words *Minimum net value of items* in an ascending order.
. Under *Discount in %*, enter the percentage that you would like to have deducted in ascending order. +
→ If you enter 50, e.g. in the field *Minimum net value of items* and 2 in the field *Discount in %*, a 2% discount is offered for orders totalling £50 or more.
. Select whether the *Volume discount* should be taken into consideration.

You find information about how to create customer classes in the <<crm/managing-contacts#15, Creating a customer class>> chapter.

[discrete]
===== What the customer sees when making a purchase

The discount is calculated and displayed once the customer has finished putting items into their shopping cart and has gone to the checkout. Initially, only the total discount is displayed in the shopping cart. When the customer completes the order and clicks on Go to cashier, the discount is calculated for the individual variations in addition to the total discount and displayed accordingly.

[#28]
==== Setting up a discount based on the method of payment

With the discount type *Discount based on the method of payment* you offer customers a discount if they use one or more payment methods.

[TIP]
.Directly saving a discount based on the method of payment
====
Instead of configuring the settings in this menu, it is also possible to directly save a global discount for a payment method. An example is a discount in percent for the payment method *Cash in advance*. For further information, refer to the <<payment/managing-payment-methods#20, Managing payment methods>> page of the manual. You are not able to completely customise the settings if you save a discount directly for a payment method. It is only possible to completely customise the settings when using the option *Discount based on the method of payment* in the *Setup » CRM » Customer classes* menu.
====

Proceed as described below to set up a discount based on one or more payment methods.

[.instruction]
Setting up a discount based on the method of payment:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.
. Expand the customer class that the discount should be applied to (icon:plus-square-o[]).
. Enter a *Payment due date* in days, which you would like to permit for this customer class.

. Under *Discount in %*, enter the percentage that you would like to have deducted.
. Select whether the *Volume discount* should be taken into consideration.
. Select which of the payment methods that are available in the online shop should be permitted for this customer class.
. Enter payment instructions. +
→ These payment instructions are displayed on invoices.
. Select whether the prices in the online shop should be displayed as *gross* (including VAT) or *net* (excluding VAT) prices.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

You find information about how to create customer classes in the <<crm/managing-contacts#15, Creating a customer class>> chapter.

[#29]
==== Saving sales prices as discounts

A volume-related discount is created as own price in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu. Using the option *Minimum quantity* in the *Settings* area, you specify for the sales price from which item quantity the discounted price should be valid. You can realise graduated prices by creating multiple sales prices accordingly and entering the desired minimum quantities.

The discounted sales price is activated once you set the option *Volume discount* in the customer class to *Include*. A customer receives the discount in case they belong to the customer class and in case they order at least the quantity saved for the sales price.

[.instruction]
Saving sales prices as discounts:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices*.
. Open the sales price.
. Enter a number in the *Settings* tab in the field *Minimum quantity*. This number determines from which item quantity the discounted price is valid.
. Activate the customer classes in the *Class* area for which the sales price should be valid.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

For further information about sales prices, refer to the <<item/settings/prices#100, Sales prices and price calculation>> page.

[#30]
==== Manually entering a discount

=== Creating a contact

Do you want to easily and quickly create new contacts with an individually adjustable user interface, e.g. during a phone call?

The user interface to create a new contact opens in a default view that you can easily edit afterwards. This individually adjustable user interface allows maximum flexibility. You can choose exactly those fields that are most appropriate for you and your everyday work.

[TIP]
.More features and functions will be added
====
We continue to work on the implementation of new features and functions and will add them here step by step.

* Input fields can be freely positioned, regardless of the currently associated component, e.g. address details within the contact details

* Further address components will be added to allow creating multiple addresses at once.
====

You will find a small insight into the default view of the user interface as well as into the editing mode in the following video:

video::432410505[vimeo]

Proceed as described below to create a new contact. Link the contact to an existing company or create a new company. Add contact details such as email addresses and telephone numbers.

.*Example:{nbsp}terms of payment with valuta, payment due date, days for early payment discount and percentage for early payment discount*
--
You can use the options *Valuta*, *Payment due date*, *Days for early payment discount* and *Percentage for early payment discount* to set up the following terms of payment:

60 days valuta, 30 days net (payment due date), 10 days with a 2 % early payment discount

Explanation: The contact receives a 2% discount if they pay within 10 days. The payment is late after a total of 91 days. When incoming payments are imported and assigned, they are automatically checked internally to see whether the contact's early payment discount is valid. If the early payment discount time period has expired, the order receives the status *Partial payment received*. The terms of payment listed above are automatically applied to the order and the <<orders/order-documents#intable-payment-terms-documents, documents>>. It is possible to manually adjust or enter the <<orders/managing-orders#intable-payment-terms-order, order settings, terms of payment>> in the order, if no values have been saved yet in the <<crm/managing-contacts#intable-edit-contact-account-valuta, contact data record>> and in the <<crm/managing-contacts#intable-customer-class-payment-due-date, customer class>>.

=== Converting a guest account into a regular account

If the guest order came from a marketplace, for example eBay, or the contact ordered as a guest in your old online shop, the account type *Guest account* is saved as contact option in the detail view of the contact. Guest accounts have the value 1. Delete the contact option with the value 1 in order to convert the guest account into a regular account.

icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] Send an email to the contact and inform them that the guest account was converted into a regular account. They can then create a password to be able to log into your plentyShop.

[IMPORTANT]
If a contact ordered as a guest in plentyShop LTS, _no_ contact ID will be created for this guest order (GDPR conformity). Only the address data from the order will be saved. You can recognise a guest order by the check mark (icon:check[]) in the *Guest* column in the overview of the *CRM » Quick search* menu.


[.instruction]
Converting a guest account into a regular account:

. Go to *CRM » Contacts*.
. Search (icon:search[role="blue"]) the contact by means of the filter settings as described in the <<crm/managing-contacts#200, Searching for a contact>> chapter. +
→ The contacts that correspond to the search criteria entered are displayed.
. Click in the line of the contact. +
→ The detail view of the contact opens.
. In the *Contact options* area, click in the line of the account type (type: *Account*, sub-type: *Guest*, value: *1*) on *Delete contact option* (icon:minus-square[role="red"]).
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The account type is changed from *Guest account* to *Regular account* in the history of the contact.

[NOTE]
.Guest accounts via the plentyShop can only be found in the quick search
====
In order to be able to work GDPR-compliant, no contact data record is created in case of guest orders via plentyShop LTS. Orders that were placed as a guest via a plentyShop can therefore not be found via the *CRM » Contacts* menu. The data of the guest can only be found via the address data in the *CRM » Quick search* menu. +

Further information about converting plentyShop guest orders into regular contact data records can be found on the <<crm/quick-search#, Quick search>> page in the <<crm/quick-search#convert-guest-account, Converting a guest account into a contact data record>> chapter.

[#400]
=== Deleting a contact

You can delete individual contacts. Also all addresses that are saved for the contact will be deleted when they are not linked to an order.
A contact data record can only be deleted when it is not linked to an order or to a ticket.

[IMPORTANT]
.When linked to an order or ticket: anonymise data record
====
When the contact is linked to an order or to a ticket or when the contact is a supplier who is linked to a reorder or redistribution, it is not possible to delete the data record. +
In this case, you have, however, the possibility to anonymise the data record. How to proceed is described on the <<crm/quick-search#, Quick search>> page in the <<crm/quick-search#anonymise-data-record, Anonymising a data record>> chapter.
====

=== Duplicate check for contact data records with identical email address

When creating new and updating existing contact data records, the email address is checked in order to avoid duplicate entries in the system.

The logic works in the following way:

* When creating a new contact, the system searches for an existing regular contact with identical private email address. If a contact is found, this contact is updated with the new data. If no contact is found, a new regular contact is created.

* When updating the private email address of an existing regular contact, the system searches if another regular contact with the same private email address exists. If this is the case, the private email address of the current contact is not updated. All other data, however, is updated.

== Checking the VAT number

The value added tax identification number (VAT number) is an exclusive identification number and serves to designate VAT registered individuals. Within the EU, tax offices need this number for VAT accounting purposes. The VAT check via the European Commission allows you to verify German and international VAT numbers. These checks can be carried out daily from 5:00 a.m. to 11 p.m. CET.

Checking the VAT number in the plentymarkets back end is not possible. You can, however, download a plugin in the plentyMarketplace, e.g. the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/vatidcheck_6023[VAT ID Check^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] to carry out the VAT ID check.

[#5700]
=== Checking the VAT number in the online shop

The VAT number is automatically checked in the online shop during the order process. If an invalid VAT number was entered, the customer is only able to complete their order once a valid VAT number has been entered or once the entry has been deleted.

[#5800]
=== Exporting check data

You can export a list of all the check data or the data for the current month. For further information about exporting the VAT number check data, refer to the <<data#, Data>> section.
