:description: Learn how to use the EmailBuilder in plentymarkets and create email templates with a modular concept using widgets and variables.
:page-aliases: emailbuilder-testphase.adoc
:author: team-crm

All emails that are sent with plentymarkets to your xref:crm:contacts.adoc#[contacts] are based on templates. You create and manage templates with the EmailBuilder in the *CRM » EmailBuilder* menu.

Watch this link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnQ2MpTZEQw[video^] to learn more about the EmailBuilder.

[TIP]
.Email templates are sent in multipart format
====
The email templates in the EmailBuilder use the multipart format. This means that the emails are sent in an HTML and in a text version at the same time. +
This ensures that your emails can be read by all recipients, even if their email client restricts or completely disables the display of HTML in emails. On the other hand, the HTML versions of your emails that you designed are displayed for the recipients whose email client allows the display of HTML. The advantage for you is that you only have to maintain one email template.
====

The EmailBuilder is a modular construction kit for quickly creating and editing your email templates via drag-and-drop. The EmailBuilder consists of 2 views: the configuration manager and the editor.

* With the configuration manager, you create folders and, if needed, sub-folders, templates as well as templates for your footer and your header.

* With the editor, you fill your templates, headers and footers with content. You can create a template for an invoice, for example, and use this template for all invoices that are sent to your customers in the future.

You can then use the header and footer templates in the email templates as desired. Header and footer are globally active; changes you make to the header and footer affect the rest of all existing templates and all other templates that you will create in the future.

The header, the footer and the settings in the template such as the name, the subject etc. form the framework of your email, so to say. The content of the template is formed with <<#insert-widget, widgets>> and <<#variables-emailbuilder, variables>>. In the emails that are sent to your customer, the variables will then be replaced with the correct content. For example: The variable `Delivery address First name and last name` will be replaced in the email with the first name and the last name of the contact from the delivery address.

In case of certain events, e.g. if a new order is placed in your plentyShop or when a contact subscribes to a newsletter, your plentymarkets system automatically <<#automate-email-despatch, creates emails from these templates>> and sends them to your contacts.

[#email-signature]
=== Saving the email signature

Go to the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* menu to save the signature in HTML format or plain text in the *Signature* step. The signature is then automatically added to your email templates when you inserted the corresponding variable in the template.

[IMPORTANT]
.Note the priority of the signature
====
The signature that was saved for a user in his or her user account in the *Setup » Account management » Accounts* menu takes priority over the signature that is saved in the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Signature* step. +
*_This means:_* If you insert, for example, the variable `Signature in HTML format` or `Signature in plain text` in the email template, the signature is taken from the user account. If no signature is saved in the user account, the signature that is saved in the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Signature* step is used.
====

[#e-mail-info-service]
=== Setting up the email information service

In the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* menu, you can set in the *Info service* step that a blind copy of all emails is sent by your plentymarkets system to an email address of your choice. This can be particularly helpful in the early stages of your online shop, as it allows you to maintain an overview of all sent emails and recognise where processes can still be improved. You can also set here that you automatically receive an info email when a new order has been placed.

[#email-automatic-despatch]
=== Setting up the automatic despatch

The *Automatic despatch* step of the *Email accounts* assistant contains various events that you can link with a template. You can find the assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* menu. Select from the drop-down list the template that you <<#create-template, created>> before in the *CRM » EmailBuilder* menu. This ensures that the email template is sent to your contacts once the event occurs.

[IMPORTANT]
.Removing the link before deleting the email template
====
Deleting an email template that is linked with an event in the *Automatic despatch* step of the *Email accounts* assistant may lead to undesired effects. Therefore, first go to *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* » *Email accounts* assistant and remove the link in the *Automatic despatch* step by selecting the option *Do not send* from the drop-down list in the line of the event. Afterwards, <<#delete-template, delete>> the template in the *CRM » EmailBuilder* menu.

You can also use pre-defined <<#use-default-templates, default templates>>. You will also learn everything about the available <<#insert-widget, widgets>> and how you can use these widgets in your templates.

[TIP]
Once you created a template, the template ID is shown in brackets in front of the template name. The systems assigns the IDs consecutively and automatically. This ID _cannot_ be changed.

The widgets and variables that are contained in the template form the actual content of your email. Via the widgets, you can insert as many variables as you like into a template by using drag-and-drop. These variables will then be replaced with the correct content when the email is sent to your customers.

The email templates in the EmailBuilder use the multipart format. This means that the emails are sent in an HTML and in a text version at the same time. +
This ensures that your emails can be read by all recipients, even if their email client restricts or completely disables the display of HTML in emails. On the other hand, the HTML versions of your emails that you designed are displayed for the recipients whose email client allows the display of HTML. The advantage for you is that you only have to maintain one email template.

[TIP]
.Email templates are sent in multipart format
====
The email templates in the EmailBuilder use the multipart format. This means that the emails are sent in an HTML and in a text version at the same time. +
This ensures that your emails can be read by all recipients, even if their email client restricts or completely disables the display of HTML in emails. On the other hand, the HTML versions of your emails that you designed are displayed for the recipients whose email client allows the display of HTML. The advantage for you is that you only have to maintain one email template.

[#move-template]
=== Moving a template

You can move your templates to another folder at any time. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Moving a template:

. Go to *CRM » EmailBuilder*.
. Expand the folder (material:chevron_right[]) that contains the template you want to move.
. In the line of the template, click on material:more_vert[]. +
→ A new window opens.
. Click on material:move_down[] *Move*. +
→ The *Move* window opens.
. Select the target folder.
. Click on *Move*. +
→ The template is moved to the selected folder.

[#edit-template]
=== Editing a template

The following instruction describes how to edit templates in general. The procedure is thus identical for editing all templates, i.e. also editing the templates that you created for the header and the footer.

[TIP]
.Switching between multiple templates
====
If you later edit multiple templates in the editor at the same time, you can use the navigation on the left to switch between the individual templates. The template that you have currently open is highlighted in blue font.

Also it is shown in which template section you are currently in.

* If the material:edit[] *Edit (_language_)* area is highlighted in blue font in the navigation on the left side below the template, you are in the template’s editor.

* If material:translate[] *Language settings* is highlighted in blue font, you are currently in the template’s language-specific settings.

If you are in the editor or in the language settings of a template and want to switch to another template without having saved the changes beforehand, a message will be displayed.
====

[.instruction]
Editing a template:

. Go to *CRM » EmailBuilder*.
. Expand the folder (material:chevron_right[]) that contains the template you want to edit.
. Click on the template.
. Carry out the changes. Note <<#table-emailbuilder-create-template>>.
. *Save* (material:save[]) the settings.

Besides the language-dependent settings where you can <<#adjust-subject, adjust the subject>> and select static attachments for your template, for example, you can also adjust the template’s content by clicking on material:edit[].

In the *Settings* area of the template, select an owner, the client and the header and footer, if not done already. In this area, you can also select up to 3 dynamic attachments and fill the fields *Reply to*, *CC* and *BCC*.

[#adjust-subject]
=== Adjusting the template’s subject

As soon as the template is created, you can see the prefilled content in the toolbar. Adjust the subject by clicking on *Language-dependent settings* (material:translate[]) in the top right corner. In this area, you can also select up to 3 static attachments that are attached to the email template. Also in this area, you can adjust the xref:crm:emailbuilder.adoc#examples-custom-styles[custom styles] of the template such as the template width and font size and define the <<#intable-template-settings-number-format, number format>>, <<#intable-template-settings-date-format, date format>> and <<#intable-template-settings-time-format, time format>> for your templates.

[#add-language]
=== Adding a language to the template

You can add the following languages to your template, your header and your footer:

* All
** Select *All* if you use your company logo in the header only and therefore don’t need to take into account any content-related adjustments or a translation to another language.
* German
* English
* Bulgarian
* French
* Italian
* Spanish
* Turkish
* Dutch
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Norwegian
* Romanian
* Danish
* Swedish
* Czech
* Russian
* Slovakian
* Chinese
* Vietnamese

Let’s assume, you have created a shipping confirmation in English and added widgets and variables. Now, you want to create this shipping confirmation also in French for your French-speaking customers. The quickest way is to copy the template and adjust the translation afterwards. How to proceed in this case is described in the <<#copy-template, Copying a template>> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Important: Add header and footer in the corresponding language
====
If you created a template in <<#add-language, multiple languages>>, remember to create also the header and footer in these languages and to link them with the template. Otherwise, the template cannot be sent.
====

[#copy-template]
=== Copying a template

You want to copy an existing template to save time when creating a new template with similar content? To do so, proceed as follows.

[TIP]
_Before copying the template_, carry out the settings in the <<#intable-general-template-settings, Settings>> area. The advantage of this sequence is that you also copy the settings themselves and not only the template content. Thus, you don’t need to carry out the settings for the other templates again.

[.instruction]
Copying a template:

. Go to *CRM » EmailBuilder*.
. Expand the folder (material:chevron_right[]) that contains the template you want to copy.
. In the line of the template that you want to copy, click on material:more_vert[]. +
→ A new window opens.
. Click on material:content_copy[] *Copy*. +
→ A new window opens.
. Select the language from the list that you want to copy the template to. +
→ The *Enter subject* window opens. +
*_Note:_* By default, the language abbreviation of the selected language is preselected.
. Enter the subject in the selected language.
. Click on *Save*. +
→ The template is copied and opens in the language that you have just selected.
. Now <<#edit-template, edit>> the copied template according to your needs and adjust the translation.

[#delete-template]
=== Deleting a template

Proceed as described below to delete templates. Only the assembled template will be deleted but _not_ the components contained in it such as the header and footer.

[.instruction]
Deleting a template:

. Go to *CRM » EmailBuilder*.
. Expand the folder (material:chevron_right[]) that contains the template you want to delete.
. In the line of the template that you want to delete, click on material:more_vert[]. +
→ A new window opens.
. Click on material:delete[] *Delete*. +
→ A window opens and you need to confirm your decision.
. Click on *Delete*. +
→ The template is deleted.

[#remove-language]
=== Removing a language from the template

Proceed as described below to remove a certain language from the template.

[.instruction]
Removing a language from the template:

. Go to *CRM » EmailBuilder*.
. Expand the folder (material:chevron_right[]) that contains the template from which you want to remove a language.
. Click on the template.
. In the template’s tabs at the top, select the language that you want to remove.
. Click on material:more_vert[]. +
→ A new window opens.
. Click on material:delete[] *Delete*. +
→ A window opens and you need to confirm your decision.
. Click on *Delete*. +
→ The language is removed from the template.

[#automate-email-despatch]
== Automating the email despatch

You have multiple options in plentymarkets to automate the email despatch to your customers.

* <<#automatic-email-despatch, Setting up the automatic email despatch>>
* <<#set-up-event-procedures, Setting up event procedures>>
* <<#email-despatch-to-multiple-email-addresses, Email despatch to multiple email addresses>>

[#automatic-email-despatch]
=== Setting up automatic emails

Set up the automatic despatch in the *Email accounts* assistant. You can find the assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup* menu. +
You can link different events with already <<#create-template, created>> templates in this area.

To see the available events, refer to the <<#email-automatic-despatch, Setting up the automatic despatch>> chapter.

[#set-up-event-procedures]
=== Setting up event procedures

Besides the possibility to <<#automatic-email-despatch, link events and templates>>, you can also set up event procedures in the *Setup » Orders » Events* menu. Define an event, activate one or more filters and decide which procedures your plentymarkets system should carry out automatically when the event occurs.

For example, you can use filters to trigger a procedure once a contact has placed a certain number of orders or has been assigned another customer class. The procedure could send an email that includes a coupon. For further information, refer to the xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[Event procedures] page.

[#email-despatch-to-multiple-email-addresses]
=== Email despatch to multiple email addresses

Go to *Setup » Orders » Events* to set up an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedure] that will send an email to your customers and employees when the event that you determined occurs in your plentyShop.

Add in the event procedure the procedure *Customer > Send email* and select the appropriate template as well as the recipients to send the email to multiple recipients at the same time once the selected event occurs.

The following recipients are available:

* Customer
* Warehouse
* Invoice address from order
* Invoice address from order
* Contact email business
* Contact email private
* Contact email PayPal
* available owners

You can either send the same template to all recipients or select a separate template each.

[#variables-emailbuilder]
== Available variables and twig expressions

In some of the widgets you can insert variables to create the templates you need. In the emails that are sent to your customer, the variables will then be replaced with the correct content.

Besides the variables, the tables in the <<#available-variables, Available variables>> chapter contain also the corresponding twig expressions. You need twig expressions for the subject line of your email and for the <<#intable-widget-code, code widget>> because it is not possible to use variables in there.

[#twig-introduction]
=== Twig expressions for the code widget and the subject line

Besides the variables, you can find also the twig expressions in the <<#available-variables, Available variables>> chapter. Twig expressions can be used in the code widget and in a template’s subject line.

[#twig-subject]
==== Twig expression in the subject line

If you want to use a twig expression in the template’s subject line, this expression has to be surrounded by double curly brackets.

*_Example:_* If you want to display the shipping service provider in your template’s subject line, open the expandable area *Order / Shipping*, search for the variable *Shipping service provider* and insert the corresponding twig expression in the <<#adjust-subject, subject line>> of your template as follows: `&#123;&#8288;&#123;order.formattedShipping.providerName&#125;&#8288;&#125;`.

You can find code examples for the subject line in the <<#code-examples-subject, Code examples for the subject line>> chapter.


[#twig-code-widget]
==== Twig expression in the code widget

If you use link:https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/if.html[if queries^] or link:https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/for.html[for loops^] in your code widget, for example, there is no need to insert double curly brackets in the if query itself, but in the body text. For further information about twig, refer to the link:https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/[Twig documentation^].

In the <<#code-examples-code-widget, Code examples for the code widget>> chapter, you can find some if queries and for loops that you can simply copy to your code widget.

[#available-variables]
=== Available variables
