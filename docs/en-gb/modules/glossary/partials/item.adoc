[#item]
Item:: Items can be thought of as _data containers_. They always include one or more <<#variation, variations>>, i.e. one or more saleable versions of a product. For example, if you sell a t-shirt in small, medium, and large, then all of these sizes together form the item. Each individual size is a variation of the item. +
