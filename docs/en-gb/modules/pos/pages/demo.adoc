=== Cancellations and returns

[#2000]
[.collapseBox]
.*Cancelling an order directly after the purchase*
--
Your customer just bought an item. But uh-oh, now he’s noticed it’s the wrong one. Now he wants to cancel the transaction.

[.instruction]
Cancelling an order directly after purchase:

. From the end screen, tap on icon:trash[role="red"] *Cancel order*.
. Tap on icon:check[role="blue"] *Yes*. +
. Was the original order paid for with a credit or debit card? Decide whether the customer should be refunded in cash (icon:money[role="blue"]) or via the terminal (icon:credit-card[role="blue"]). +
→ The order is cancelled.
. Refund the customer directly or process the refund via the POS terminal.

--

[#2100]
[.collapseBox]
.*Cancelling an order the same day it was purchased*
--
Your customer bought an item in the morning and then later that afternoon noticed it was the wrong one. Can he still cancel the transaction?

[#2200]
[.collapseBox]
.*Your customer wants to return items*
--

Imagine your customer bought each of his three nephews a new Christmas jumper. But children grow like weeds and two of the kids didn’t fit into their jumpers on Christmas morning. Now in January, your customer wants to return two of the three jumpers.

Since the order was created before the last Z report, it can no longer be cancelled. The order needs to be _returned_ instead.

[discrete]
===== Did your customer bring the receipt?

If your customer brought the receipt with him, then you can find the original order, e.g. by looking at the receipt number. In this case, you can directly link the return to the original order.

Of course, even if you _can’t_ link the return to the original order, it will still be possible to accept the return. You’ll just have to proceed a little differently. Both procedures are described below.


[discrete]
===== Do you use a scanner?

The procedure differs a little depending on whether you use a scanner or enter the data manually. Both procedures are described below.

=== Reports

[#2220]
[.collapseBox]
.*Documenting the cash on hand*
--

You can check how much cash is in the register at any given time. This is done by creating a so-called “till count” report. The banknotes and coins are physically counted and the result is documented.

[instruction]
Saving a till count result:

. From the start screen, tap on icon:money[role="darkGrey"] *Till count*. +
→ The lowest coin denomination is preselected.
. Use the numpad to enter the number of coins you counted for this denomination.
. Tap on the return arrow (icon:level-down[role="green"]) to jump to the next denomination. Repeat this process until you have entered the quantity of all coins and notes.
. Tap on icon:check[role="green"] *Save till count*. +
→ A till count report will be created. In the full version, the result is saved in your plentymarkets ERP system. The demo mode simulates the result.
. If the actual cash on hand differs from the expected cash on hand, then you may want to book the difference.

[discrete]
===== Mobile phone vs. tablet view

If you use a mobile phone, then you can swipe left or right to switch from one denomination to the next. +
If you use a tablet, then you can directly tap on a denomination on the left.


[discrete]
===== What if I don’t want to count each coin and banknote individually?

If you use a mobile phone and you don’t want to enter each denomination individually, then tap on icon:long-arrow-right[role="green"] *Skip denominations* and enter the total amount. +
If you use a tablet and you don’t want to enter each denomination individually, then tap on the field *Overwrite* and enter the total amount.


--

[#2230]
[.collapseBox]
.*Documenting daily revenue*
--

At the end of the day, it’s customary to document how much revenue was generated in the last 24 hours. This is done by creating a so-called “Z report”.

Strictly speaking, a Z report documents the revenue accrued since the last Z report. In some countries, sellers are required to save these reports for fiscal purposes.

[instruction]
Creating a Z report:

. From the start screen, tap on icon:file-text-o[role="darkGrey"] *Z report*.
. Count the actual cash on hand and enter this amount.
. Tap on icon:check[role="green"] *Create z report*. +
→ The Z report is created. In the full version, the report is given a consecutive number and it is saved in your plentymarkets ERP system. The demo mode simulates the report. +
→ The daily revenue is reset to 0.

=== Additional functions

[#2400]
[.collapseBox]
.*Pausing transactions*
--
Imagine you're in the middle of a transaction and your customer says he's forgotten something. But the next customer is already waiting in line. Don’t worry! You can simply “park” the first customer’s transaction. Then you can ring up the second customer in the meantime.

[.instruction]
Parking an order:

. Tap on the vertical ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-v[role="blue"]) at the top right of the POS shopping cart. +
→ Additional options are displayed.
. Tap on icon:download[role="blue"] *Park receipt*. +
→ The *Park receipt* window is displayed.
. Tap on icon:check[role="blue"] *Yes*. +
→ The order is saved and a new transaction can be started.

[discrete]
===== Retrieving a parked order

Tap on the vertical ellipsis again (icon:ellipsis-v[role="blue"]) and then tap on icon:upload[role="blue"] *Load receipt*. You’ll see an overview of all the parked orders. Tap on an order to load it and continue the transaction.


--

[#2500]
[.collapseBox]
.*Modifying the item data in special cases*
--
Did you accidentally enter the wrong item quantity? Or is one of the items damaged and you agreed on special price with your customer?

Tap on an item and change its data directly while ringing up the customer. The changes only apply to this order. They do not modify the item data record in the plentymarkets ERP system.

//5 Sek Video

[#2600]
[.collapseBox]
.*Depositing or withdrawing cash from the register*
--
Is your cashier starting to run out of change? Then you’ll need to put more coins in the till drawer and of course, document the procedure correctly.

[instruction]
Booking a cash deposit or withdrawal:

. From the start screen, tap on icon:money[role="darkGrey"] *Deposits and withdrawals*.
. Select a reason from the drop-down list.
. Enter text into the field *Additional information* and thus define the event as precisely as possible.
. Enter the amount with the number pad.
. Depending on the situation, tap on icon:long-arrow-down[role="green"] *Deposit* or icon:long-arrow-up[role="red"] *Withdrawal*. +
→ The cash drawer will open and a receipt will be printed. The demo mode simulates printing.

[discrete]
===== Save your own reasons and accounts in the full version

Revenue needs to be booked separately if it flows into or out of your cash register for any reason other than sales.
Sales are booked on so-called _revenue accounts_ whereas events like deposits and withdrawals are saved on _booking accounts_, along with their appropriate reasons.

The demo version includes several example reasons. But you can save your own reasons and booking accounts in the full version. This allows you to differentiate between events that affect your revenue and events that don’t.


--

[#2700]
[.collapseBox]
.*Miscellaneous items with dummy data records*
--
Do you have a bargain bin in your store? Miscellaneous items, seasonal items, remnants - these sorts of items usually aren’t worth the time it takes to enter data into plentymarkets. However, you can still sell them with the help of dummy data records. Try it out in the demo version!

Just like any other item, you can enter dummy items by <<pos/demo#500, scanning the barcode>>, by <<pos/demo#500, choosing it from the list of favourites>> or by <<pos/demo#500, manually entering its item number>>.
Then enter the price at which this item should be sold.

Scan the example dummy item or add the “dummy” item (ID 1080) to the shopping cart.

--
Do you run an online shop as well as a brick and mortar store? If so, then you can allow customers to buy items online and pick them up personally in your local store.

Furthermore, customers can decide if they would rather pay for their items while ordering online or when they come to pick up their items in person.

[.instruction]
Completing online orders at the POS:

. Tap on the vertical ellipsis (icon:ellipsis-v[role="blue"]) at the top right of the POS shopping cart. +

.*Switching to a different user account*
--
Will your employees share devices? Constantly logging in and out can quickly waste a lot of time. Instead of having users log out, it will be faster if they use a PIN to switch from one account to another.

Try it out in the demo mode! We’ve created three fictional cashiers who you can work with. Each cashier has their own app PIN.
