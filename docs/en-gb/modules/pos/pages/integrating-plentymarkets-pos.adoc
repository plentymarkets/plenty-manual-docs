== First steps and general information

The point of sale system plentyPOS is provided as a component of the xref:app:installation.adoc#[plentymarkets app]. Take a look at our documentation and learn:

* which xref:app:installation.adoc#400[hardware requirements] apply to plentyPOS.
* where you can xref:app:installation.adoc#500[download the free plentymarkets app].
* how to xref:app:installation.adoc#600[grant your employees access to the app].
* how to xref:app:installation.adoc#1100[log into the app and find your way around].

plentyPOS can be operated in Euro (EUR), Swiss Franks (CHF) and Pound Sterling (GBP). However, you can only operate the POS in the xref:payment:currencies.adoc#30[system currency]. The system currency is set in the *System » System settings » Orders » Payment » Currencies* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
====
.Book a POS
To use plentyPOS, you need to link:https://www.plentymarkets.com/product/pricing/[book one or more POS for your plentymarkets edition^]. Visit our link:https://www.plentymarkets.com/product/modules/point-of-sale/[plentyPOS product page^] to get further information on prices and terms and conditions.
====

After you have booked POS, it takes two or three minutes for the activation process to finish in the background. Then, log out of your plentymarkets system and log in again. This step is also necessary if you have already set up points of sale and book one or several new points of sale later.

Afterwards, you carry out the settings for the points of sale in the plentymarkets back end. First, you assign a POS to a client by creating a POS in the *System » System settings » Client » [Select client] » POS* menu and carrying out further settings. To do so, proceed as described below.

[WARNING]
.Do not change POS settings while POS is in use
====
Do not change POS settings while the POS is in use. If you have to make changes to the POS settings, tell POS users to log out of the app and log back in. Otherwise, discrepancies may occur to totals especially if you make changes to the rounding settings.
====

2+^| *Sales warehouse*

| *Sales warehouse*
|Select the sales warehouse to which you want to book orders generated with this POS. +

Activated (default setting) = Items are booked out automatically. The *Book outgoing items* button is not shown. +
Not activated = Items are booked out only if the POS user taps the *Book outgoing items* button. +
*_Tip:_* Deactivate the option if your customers do not receive their goods at the POS.

| *Outgoing items for external orders: Book items out of POS sales warehouse* +
(app version 1.9.2 and higher)
|Select from which warehouse the order items are to be booked out when external orders are completed at the POS. +
Not activated (default setting) = The order items are booked out of the warehouse that was assigned to the order when the order was created. +
Activated = The order items are booked out of the *Sales warehouse* saved for the POS. The warehouse originally saved for the order is overwritten.

2+^| *Operation*

| *Query price if price is 0,00*
|Activate the option to enter the price manually if an item with a price of 0 is added to a POS order.

| *Add favourites with quantity 1*
|Activate the option to automatically add favourites to the POS shopping cart with the quantity 1. Add the item to shopping cart again to increase the quantity. +
*_Tip:_* The quantity of favourites that were added via the item search must still be entered manually.

| *Numpad (tablet view): Show quick buttons for quantity and exact payment*
a|Activate the option to show quick buttons for the numpad of the POS. +
Not activated = The numpad quick buttons are not shown. +
Activated = The following numpad quick buttons are shown as an additional row of the POS’s number pad:

* *X* = POS users can enter a quantity before scanning an item or selecting a favourite item. If no quantity is entered before scanning, the scanned item is added to a POS order with a quantity of 1.
* *Exact cash amount* = If customers pay the exact amount in cash, POS users can tap this button instead of entering the amount. The *Received* field is filled with the amount due.

| *Show expected cash on hand*
|Choose whether the expected cash on hand should be displayed while creating a xref:pos:plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users.adoc#230[z report] or a xref:pos:plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users.adoc#450b[till count report]. This option is deactivated by default. In other words, POS users _do not_see how much money is expected to be in the till while they count the cash. It’s a good idea not to change this setting, as it ensures that POS users really count the cash themselves. If POS users see this information, they might be tempted to blindly accept the value rather than count themselves.

| *Cash register drawer*
|Select if the cash drawer should only be opened if customers pay in cash or a cash refund takes place. If his option is activated, the cash drawer will not be opened if in case of payments or refunds via card terminals.

2+^| *Loyalty card*

(app version 1.9.2 and higher)
|Select what contact data is searched if a barcode with a plus sign prefix (+) is scanned. +
*Contact ID* (default setting) = Select this option if barcodes contain the contact ID. +
*Customer number* (recommended) = Select this option if barcodes contain the customer number. +
*_Tip:_* If you select *Customer number*, this allows you to print loyalty cards with barcodes in advance. The barcode code minus the plus sign is then entered into the *Customer number* field of the contact. For more information on ordering and using customer cards, refer to the chapter <<#990, using customer cards>>.

2+^| *Fiscalisation (Germany)* +

*_Tip:_*Click on *Generate key* to generate a random key. +
*_Note:_* Existing POS cannot be made tamper-proof. Create a new POS and decommission the old POS to set up the signature unit.

| *Trust service provider* +
(new POS with location in Austria only)

[[table-POS-receipt-template]]
.Editing the receipt template
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+^|Receipt settings

| *Print and save gift card receipt*
a|Select if a coupon receipt should be printed and saved in the document archive. +

Not activated (default) = No coupon receipt is printed. +
Activated = A coupon receipt is printed when a coupon is sold or partially redeemed. +
→ The coupon receipt is created and saved in the document archive. +
→ If the option *Automatic printing* is activated in the plentymarkets app under *plentymarkets app » Settings » POS*, the coupon receipt is printed after the POS receipt is printed. +
→ If the option  *Automatic printing* is not activated in the plentymarkets app under  *plentymarkets app » Settings » POS*, the POS user can print the coupon receipt manually after completing the order. +
The coupon receipt shows the following information about the coupon:

* Coupon value
* Coupon code
* For partially redeemed coupons: redeemed amount and remaining amount

*_Note:_* Regardless of the setting you select, the coupon code is always printed on the normal POS order receipt when a coupon is sold.

| *Hide grand total on z report*
|Select if the xref:glossary:glossary#grand-total[grand total] should be included in the z report. +
Not activated (default) = The grand total is not included in the z report. +
*_Note:_* In this case, the grand total can only be displayed at the point of sale itself by users with admin rights. +
Activated = The grand total is included in the z report.

| *List discount codes on z report individually*
|Select if discount codes redeemed in connection with xref:glossary:glossary#promotional-coupon[promotional coupons] should be listed individually on the z report. +

Not activated (default) = The total amount of all redeemed coupon codes is listed on the z report. +
Activated = Identical coupon codes are displayed in a single entry of the z report. In addition, the respective number of coupon codes is listed so that you can differentiate between different codes.

2+^|Receipt content

| *List identical order items*
|Select how to list several identical variations on receipts. +
*Individually* = Every variation is shown individually irrespective of the quantity being sold. Example: +
---------------------------------------------------- +
Cat food CaTasty Deluxe           6.99 GBP +
Cat food CaTasty Deluxe           6.99 GBP +
Cat food CaTasty Deluxe           6.99 GBP +
---------------------------------------------------- +
*In aggregate* = Identical variations are shown in aggregate. Example: +
---------------------------------------------------- +
Cat food CaTasty Deluxe           20.97 GBP +
3 x 6.99 GBP +
---------------------------------------------------- +

| *Order item details*
|Select one of the options *Variation ID*, *Variation number*, *Attributes* or *External variation ID* to
display the corresponding additional information on the sold item on the receipt. The information is displayed below the item name on the receipt. Activate the option *None* if no additional information should be displayed.

| *Image*
|Activate the option and select a PNG file to display on the receipts generated by the POS. The file has to be uploaded to the *CMS » Image gallery* menu beforehand.

| *Header*
|If the option is selected, the field's content is displayed as a header on all receipts issued by the POS. By default, the header contains the information saved in the *System » Settings » Master data* menu. Make changes as needed.

| *Barcode*
|Should barcodes be displayed on your receipts? +
In case of a xref:pos:plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users.adoc#175[return] or a xref:pos:plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users.adoc#[Click & Collect order], customers usually bring their receipts to the store. If a barcode was printed on the receipt, the POS user only has to xref:pos:plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users.adoc#520[scan the barcode] to access the corresponding order. +
In other words, barcodes help POS users find orders faster. It’s no longer necessary to manually enter a receipt number or an order ID. +
*_Note_*: The receipt number is displayed as a barcode and it includes an asterisk (*) as its prefix. When a barcode is scanned, the asterisk specifies that the user is looking for a barcode.

| *Footer*
|Activate this option and enter an additional text.

[#130]
== Managing user accounts for plentyPOS

The following preparations are necessary to allow POS users access to plentyPOS:

* Create a user account of the user class *Backend*
* Activate rights for POS visibility
* Activate rights for POS functions (optional)
* Activate rights for communication with the plentymarkets back end via REST API
* Activate rights for visibility of key figures (optional)
* Activate order referrers

The settings you need to create a user account for a POS user are described below. For general information about user accounts and user rights, refer to the xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#[User accounts and access] page of the manual.

[TIP]
.Tip: Create a role for POS users
====
To simplify rights management for POS users, create a xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access#70[role] with those rights your POS users need, and link this role to the user accounts of POS users.
====

[#140]
=== Creating an account for POS users

To give new POS users access to plentyPOS, create a xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#[user account] of the user class *Back end* in the plentymarkets back end. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Creating user accounts for POS users:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts*.
. Click on *New* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +

[TIP]
.App PIN for quickly switching user accounts
====
The app PIN allows users to quickly switch between user accounts in some of the views of the plentymarkets app. Users always need to enter their password to log into the app for the first time. Thus, your POS users need a password *and* a PIN.
====

[#150]
=== .Assigning rights for POS users

Now assign rights for the communication between plentyPOS and the plentymarkets back end.

:rights-purpose: use the basic functionalities of plentyPOS as POS users
:right-one: pass:quotes[*POS*]
:right-two: pass:quotes[*CRM > Campaign > Code > Show*]
:right-three: pass:quotes[*CRM > Campaign > Code > Create*]

→ The user is able to access plentyPOS and can create POS orders.

[#170]
=== Activating rights for optional POS functions

For POS users to edit prices, rename order items and/or give discounts, you need to assign the appropriate rights to POS users. Click xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#70[here] to learn how to create roles and assign them to users. You also activate additional app functions for users.

By assigning roles in the plentymarkets back end, you determine the POS functions that POS users are allowed to use. You also define which additional functions and key figures are visible in the plentymarkets app.

[.instruction]
Activating rights for POS functions:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts*.
. Open a user account with *Backend* or *REST-API* access rights.
. Click on the *Mobile* tab.

== Activating payment methods for POS orders

To take payment for orders generated in plentyPOS, activate those payment methods you want to allow. As a minimum, you need to activate the payment method *Pay upon pickup* so customers can pay cash. All other payment methods are optional.

To activate the payment methods for plentyPOS, you need the free *plentyPOS payment methods* plugin. The plugin provides the following payment methods:

* *4 » Pay upon pickup* for cash payments
* *11 » Cash sale/cash card* for card payments via external payment terminals
* *1700 » Coupon* for gift card purchases

[.instruction]
Activating payment methods for POS orders:

. Install the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/pospaymentmethodrenaming_6813[plentyPOS payment methods^]. +
*_Note:_* Pay attention to the information provided in the *Description* area of the plugin.
. Go to *Setup » Assistants » Plugins*.
. Click on the plugin set in which you have installed the plugin.
. Open the assistant *plentyPOS payment methods*.
. Enter names for the payment methods.
. Complete the assistant. +
→ The payment methods are activated and are available in the *Setup » Orders » Payments » Payment methods* menu. There, you can deactivate individual payment methods as needed. However, keep in mind that at least the payment method *Pay upon pickup* has to be activated at all times for plentyPOS.

[IMPORTANT]
.Renaming payment methods
====
You can return to the assistant and finish it again at a later point in time if you wish to change the payment method names again. The name is displayed in the plentymarkets back end, on plentyPOS receipts, in the X and Z report and in all exports generated via plentyPOS.
====

Note that payment methods must also be permitted for customer classes in another menu. For further information, refer to xref:payment:managing-payment-methods.adoc#30,[Permitting the payment method in a customer class].

[TIP]
.Payment method Cash sale/cash card
====
For the payment method *11 » Cash sale/cash card*, also go to *System » Client » [Select client] » POS » [Open POS] » Tab: Payment method* and select *Unconnected device* in the *POS terminal* area.
====

[#1070]
=== Linking payment terminals

Some card terminals can be linked to plentyPOS by provisioning plugins in the plentymarkets back end. plentyPOS currently supports the following card terminals:

* link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment/ingenicozvt_5140[Ingenico devices via ZVT interface^]
* link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment/sumup_5141[SumUp Air^]

== Saving booking accounts for plentyPOS events

Orders generated in plentyPOS are assigned to the xref:orders:accounting.adoc#800[revenue accounts] saved in plentymarkets. Because deposits, withdrawals and till count discrepancies are not orders, you can save booking accounts for these POS events. This helps you to manage which booking accounts to associate with different POS deposits and withdrawals. In addition, you can save booking accounts for discrepancies resulting from till counts.

=== Saving booking accounts for till count discrepancies

If the actual cash on hand differs from the expected cash on hand after the count, you either need to balance the discrepancy or book the difference. When the difference is booked, the actual cash on hand is saved as the new expected cash on hand. At the same time, either a deposit (+) or a withdrawal (-) is booked depending on whether the difference is positive or negative. Proceed as described below to assign discrepancies resulting from till counts to booking accounts.

[.instruction]
Saving booking accounts for till count discrepancies:

. Go to *System » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting*. +
→ The *Settings* tab opens.
. Click on the *Accounts* tab. +
→ The *Posting key* tab opens.
. Click on the *POS events* tab.
. Go to the *Withdrawal* area. In the row *Till count*, go to the *Account* column.
. Enter the account that you want to assign to withdrawals that occur if there is more cash in the till than expected.
. Go to the *Deposit* area. In the row *Till count*, go to the *Account* column.
. Enter the account that you want to assign to deposits that occur if there is less money in the till than expected.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings. +
→ The booking accounts are saved. +
→ Deposits and withdrawals that result from till count discrepancies are booked to this account automatically.

=== Saving booking accounts for general deposits and withdrawals

When POS users deposit or withdraw cash from a plentyPOS, they select a POS event to save a reason for the booking. By default, one POS event *Withdrawal* and one POS event *Deposit* are saved in the system. These events cannot be deleted. If you want to book deposit and/or withdrawal amounts to specific booking accounts, you can save booking accounts for these events. Proceed as described below to save accounts for these events. You also can save additional accounts if you want to assign different booking accounts to different events.

[.instruction]
Saving booking accounts for deposits and withdrawals:

. Go to *System » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting*. +

== Specifying rounding behaviour for POS orders

Totals are always shown with 2 decimal places on plentyPOS receipts. However, the settings in the plentymarkets back end determine if order prices are rounded to 2 decimal places or if 4 decimal places are used for calculations. The rounding behaviour for orders generated in plentyPOS is determined by the following 3 options:

.Options to set rounding behaviour for POS orders
[cols="10,1,1"]
|====
|Menu |Option |Possible settings

|Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting
|Number of decimal places

|Round totals only
a|
* Yes
* No

|Setup » Client » [Select client] » POS » [Open POS] » Tab: Receipt
|List identical order items
a|
* Individually
* In aggregate
|====

These settings result in 6 combinations of settings:

* Show order items individually, round individual prices to 2 decimal places
* Show order items individually, round individual prices to 4 decimal places
* Show order items individually, round totals to 4 decimal places
* Show order items in aggregate, round individual prices to 2 decimal places
* Show order items in aggregate, round individual prices to 4 decimal places
* Show order items in aggregate, round totals to 4 decimal places

[IMPORTANT]
.Settings influence total sums
====
Total sums differ depending on the settings you select. For example, this affects the revenue calculation within the VAT report that is part of the xref:pos:plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users.adoc#230[z report]. Note that these discrepancies increase the more items requiring rounding are present per POS order and receipt.
====

=== Example calculation

<<table-POS-rounding>> shows an example calculation that illustrates rounding discrepancies resulting from different combinations of settings.

The example calculation is based on the following data:

. Calculation basis: Item at a price of 4.545 GBP
. Calculation 1: 10 items sold
. Calculation 2: 10 items sold at 5% discount

== Creating a dummy item

You may find that items are to be sold for which no data record exists in plentymarkets. For instance, it is often too labour intensive to create data records for miscellaneous items or remnants. Create a dummy item to be able to sell these items anyway. POS users can then add the dummy item to the POS shopping cart and modify the price and/or the name of the order item.

The following preparations are required to work with dummy items.

* Create a dummy item for each VAT rate you need for your product portfolio. As such, if you sell items with 19% and 7% VAT, you need two dummy items.
* Activate the option *Query price if price is 0* so POS users can enter the price manually.
* Assign POS users the right to edit prices.
* Assign POS users the right to rename order items (optional).

The required settings are described in <<table-POS-dummy-item>>. The subheadings indicate the menu in which the settings are carried out.

[#2100]
== Multipurpose coupons and promotional coupons

In plentymarkets, multipurpose coupons are treated as a product that customers can buy in the form of _gift cards_. If someone has a multipurpose coupon, they can redeem it in exchange for products or services.

In contrast, promotional coupons are used for _advertising purposes_. If someone has a coupon, then they can redeem it to get a discount in your store, e.g. 20% off everything except garden supplies.

Even though multipurpose coupons and promotional coupons are used for different purposes, they are both configured the same way in plentymarkets. Therefore, both topics are explained here in the same chapter.

The following preparations in the plentymarkets back end are necessary to sell multipurpose coupons and promotional coupons via plentyPOS:

* xref:orders:coupons.adoc#prepare-items-for-purchase-coupons[Decide which items] customers should be allowed to purchase with coupons.
* xref:orders:coupons.adoc#create-coupon-item[Create coupon items] with 0% VAT, to add the coupons to the products that your business sells.
* xref:orders:coupons.adoc#create-campaign[Create a campaign] for coupons. Use the option *Coupon variety* to speciiy whether it is a multipurpose coupon or a promotional coupon.
* xref:orders:coupons.adoc#link-coupon-item-to-campaign[Link your coupon items to the campaign].
* *_Optional:_* en:pos:integrating-plentymarkets-pos.adoc#850[Generate codes] or save your own coupon codes in the back end.
* *_Optional:_* Create coupon templates and make them available to POS users.
* *_Optional:_* Make coupon codes available to POS users.

[IMPORTANT]
.More than one POS
====
Do you have more than one POS and create your own coupon codes? Divide the printed coupon codes between the different POS or create a separate coupon campaign and coupon items to make sure that each coupon code is sold only once.
====

[#830]
=== Creating a campaign for POS multipurpose coupons

Now, create one or several campaigns for selling multipurpose coupons in plentyPOS. You have the following options:

* You create one campaign for all coupons you sell in plentyPOS.
* You create one campaign for each coupon value. +
*_Example:_* You want to sell multipurpose coupons for 10 GBP, 25 GBP and 50 GBP and a multipurpose coupon with a flexible value that POS users enter during the transaction. As such, you create 3 campaigns with the discount values 10, 25 and 50 GBP and a campaign with an amount of your choice.

If you operate more than one POS and want to use your own gift card codes it also may make sense to create separate campaigns for each POS. Proceed as described below to create a campaign for multipurpose coupons:

[.instruction]
Creating a campaign for POS multipurpose coupons:

. Go to *Orders » Coupons*.

[#850]
=== Managing coupon codes

To redeem multipurpose coupons in plentyPOS, POS users enter the coupon code. A coupon code must be present in the plentymarkets back end at the time it is redeemed.

From the point of view of POS users, the configuration options in plentymarkets result in three possible scenarios when selling coupons:

* The coupon code is generated automatically at the POS.
* The POS user is issued with a list of coupon codes for each coupon value that have been saved in plentymarkets. The POS user enters a code. The value of the coupon code is retrieved.
* The POS user is issued with a list of coupon codes that have not been saved in plentymarkets. The POS user enters a code and a value.

Find out how to configure coupon codes for these different scenarios below.

[#2200]
==== Automatically generating coupon codes at POS

Administratively, it is easiest if POS users generate a xref:pos:plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users.adoc#250[random coupon code] when they sell a coupon via plentyPOS. When the POS order is uploaded, the coupon code and the associated coupon value are then imported to the campaign that is linked to the coupon item. The coupon code is printed on the receipt. A coupon receipt is printed (optional). In addition, POS users can write down the coupon code on a decorative coupon.

[#2300]
==== Working with your own coupon codes

Your administrative work increases if you want to hand out coupon codes to POS users for them to enter when they sell items. However, it also has advantages. For instance, you can create decorative coupons that already contain the coupon code or the coupon code and the coupon value. POS users can then simply hand out these coupons.

Coupon codes can be saved in the system either before they are sold or at the time they are sold.

To save coupon codes in the plentymarkets back end before selling them:

* You generate coupon codes with fixed values in a campaign before you start selling coupons.
* You save coupon codes with fixed values in a campaign before you start selling coupons.

In both cases, you provide POS users with a list of these coupon codes and the coupon value associated with them.

To save coupon codes when they are sold:

* POS users enter a coupon code that is not yet saved in plentymarkets and the associated coupon value when selling a coupon.

In such cases, you provide POS users with a list of coupon codes. POS users enter the coupon value during the transaction. This value becomes the price at which the coupon is sold.

[IMPORTANT]
.Take note of creation date
====
You have handed out coupon codes generated in plentymarkets to POS users already and want to generate additional coupon codes? Then take note of the coupon codes' creation dates. Coupon codes are not flagged as sold in plentymarkets. To ensure that each coupon code is only sold once, only circulate the codes you created on a particular date. We recommend that you generate gift card codes in the *Orders » Coupons* menu and export these gift card codes to a CSV file. Filter the CSV file by the creation date, i.e. the column *GeneratedOn*. This leaves you with a list of the newly created coupon codes.
====

[#2400]
==== Generate coupon codes manually

Use the coupon generator in the *Codes* tab of a campaign to create one or more gift card codes automatically.

[.instruction]
Generating coupon codes with a fixed value:

. Go to *Orders » Coupons*.
. Click on the campaign for which you want to generate coupon codes.
. Click on the *Codes* tab.
. In the *Generate gift card codes manually* area to the left, enter the number of gift card codes you want to generate.
. *_Optional:_* In the *Value* field, enter the value that should be assigned to the coupon code. +
*_Tip:_* If you leave the *Value* field empty, the discount value of the campaign is assigned to the code.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="darkGrey"]) the entry. +
→ The coupon codes are created and added to the list of coupon codes.
. Click on *Export* to export the coupon codes. +
→ A CSV export of all coupon codes of the campaign is created.
. Filter the *GeneratedOn* column of the CSV file by the current date. This results in a list of all newly created coupon codes. +
. Provide POS users with the coupon codes and their value. +
*_Note:_* Do not circulate duplicate coupon codes. If you operate more than one POS, either split the coupon codes or create separate campaigns for each POS.

[#2500]
==== Saving your own coupon codes with a fixed value

Instead of generating coupon codes in plentymarkets, you also can save your own coupon codes in plentymarkets before selling them. Valid characters for coupon codes are lower and upper case letters, numbers, underscores (_) and hyphens (-).

[.instruction]
Saving your own coupon codes with a fixed value:

. Go to *Orders » Coupons*.
. Click on the campaign for which you want to save coupon codes.
. Click on the *Codes* tab.
. In the *Enter gift card code manually* area to the right, enter a code with 6 to 24 characters.
. *Save* the data. +
→ The coupon code is saved and added to the list of coupon codes. +
*_Tip:_* Use the data format *CampaignCoupon* to import several coupon codes at once. The *Discount value* is imported as the gift card value. As such, you need to create one campaign for each coupon value if you want to use the data format.
. Provide POS users with the coupon codes and their value. +
*_Note:_* Do not circulate duplicate coupon codes. If you operate more than one POS, either split the coupon codes or create separate campaigns for each POS.

[#3900]
=== Activating the printing and saving of coupon receipts

A coupon receipt can be created and printed. The coupon receipt shows the following information about the coupon:

* Coupon value
* Coupon code
* For partially redeemed coupons:
	* Redeemed amount
	* Remaining amount

[.instruction]
Activating printing of coupon receipts:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » POS*.
. Open the POS.
. Click on the *Receipt* tab.
. Activate the option *Print and save gift card receipt*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings. +

→ If the option  *Automatic printing* is not activated in the plentymarkets app under  *plentymarkets app » Settings » POS*, the POS user can print the coupon receipt manually after completing the order. +
*_Note:_* Irrespective of the setting you select, the coupon code is always printed on the normal POS order receipt when a coupon is sold.


[#840]
=== Creating a coupon item

Now, create one or more coupon items. Because the campaign ID is linked at the item level, you cannot use variations to create coupons. For further information about creating items, refer to the xref:item:new-item.adoc#[Manually creating items] page of the manual. Only settings needed for creating coupon items are described here.

==== Creating coupon items with a fixed value

POS users are not prompted to enter a price when selling coupon items with a fixed price. This speeds up the transaction but also offers less flexibility.

When working with existing coupon codes:

* The value of the existing coupon code must match the price of the item. Thus, the coupon item must be linked to the campaign with the coupon codes of the correct values. If you create one campaign for each coupon value, each campaign is linked to one item only. If you create a campaign with different coupon values, this campaigns is linked to more than one coupon item.

[.instruction]
Creating coupon items with a fixed value:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Click on *New* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The *New item* tab opens.
. Select the type *Default*.
. Enter a name. +
*_Tip:_* The name should include the coupon value.
. Enter the content *1 piece*.
. Select a category.
. Select a sales price from the drop-down list. +
*_Note:_* The sales price must be linked to the order referrer of the POS.
. Enter the coupon value as the price.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings. +
→ The item is created and opened for editing.
. Carry out the additional settings. Note <<table-POS-multipurpose-coupon-item-settings>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

[#2600]
==== Creating coupon items with a flexible value

Coupon items with flexible value are items with a price of 0.00 GBP. You can control the price at which these coupons are sold at the POS in two different ways:

* POS users enter a coupon code saved in plentymarkets. The value of the coupon code becomes the price of the coupon.
* When ringing up customers, POS users either generate a code or save a coupon code and enter the coupon value.

[.instruction]
Creating a coupon item with a flexible price:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Click on *New* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The *New item* tab opens.
. Select the type *Default*.

→ The item is created and opened for editing.
. Carry out the additional settings. Note <<table-POS-multipurpose-coupon-item-settings>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings. +
→ *_With existing coupon code:_* POS users enter a coupon code of the campaign linked to this item. The item is billed at the value of the coupon code. +
→ *_Without existing coupon code:_* POS users are prompted to enter a price when they place the item in the POS shopping basket.

=== Selling and redeeming coupon cards

Selling coupon cards with varying values directly at the POS is a simple and practical method when dealing with coupons. This allows your POS users to sell coupon cards with the individual values desired by customers directly at the POS.
To use this method, carry out the following preparatory settings first:

* In case you have not done so yet. create an xref:pos:integrating-plentymarkets-pos.adoc#830[appropriate campaign] in plentymarkets.
* Set up a xref:pos:integrating-plentymarkets-pos.adoc#2600[coupon item with a flexible value] for this coupon type in plentymarkets.
* Add this coupon item to the xref:pos:integrating-plentymarkets-pos.adoc#60[favourites list] of your POS.
* Order link:http://lmgtfy.com/?q=barcode-cards+print[barcode cards] with pre-printed codes. Most providers of barcode cards expect you to send a CSV file containing the individual codes that should be placed on the cards. Also, you should provide them a layout template in Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator format for the frame design.

[TIP]
.Use a prefix for the codes
====
If you add the prefix *#* in front of the coupon code, the redemption process will be greatly facilitated later. Using the prefix, plentyPOS will quickly identify the code as a coupon code during the scanning process. This way, you do not have to manually press the coupon dialogue button.
====

The following video tutorial provides an overview of the individual steps of selling coupons.

[#3800]
=== Assigning rights for selling coupons

Users with admin rights are able to create multipurpose coupons by default. *Back end* users must be assigned this right.

:rights-purpose: sell coupons
:right-one: pass:quotes[*CRM > Campaign > Code > Show*]
:right-two: pass:quotes[*CRM > Campaign > Code > Create*]
:right-three: pass:quotes[*CRM > Campaign > Code > Delete*]

include::_includes:page$rights.adoc[]

[#2710]
=== Notes on selling multipurpose coupons

* Revenue does not increase when a multipurpose coupon is sold.
* Sold coupons are shown separately on the z report. The cash on hand only increases if the coupon is paid for in cash.

[#2800]
=== Notes on redeeming multipurpose coupons

* The value of the multipurpose coupon is deducted from the gross total.
* The revenue is increased by the redeemed coupon amount.
* On the Z report, redeemed coupons are shown with the payment method *Gift card*.
* The cash on hand does not increase when a coupon is redeemed.

[#3600]
== Preparing returns

To accept returns, all you need to do is select a default repair storage location for returns in the POS settings and set appropriate rights for those POS users that are allowed to handle returns. No other settings are necessary to return items in plentyPOS if you want to pay out refunds in cash. Note the xref:pos:integrating-plentymarkets-pos.adoc#2000[information on handling returns]. If you want to be able to convert the refund into a coupon, also prepare xref:pos:integrating-plentymarkets-pos.adoc#3100[refund coupons].


[#2000]
=== Return information

Note the following information on handling returns in plentymarkets POS:

* For technical reasons, refunds can only be paid out in cash.
* Customers cannot return multipurpose coupons.
* You can book returns for all orders saved in the system. As such, customers also can return order items they bought from other referrers, such as the online store or a market. The POS staff decides if a customer can return an item. As such, you should inform your POS staff about any referrers that are excluded from POS returns.
* By default, POS users are shown the storage location that in the *Basic settings* tab of the POS is set up as the *Default repair storage location*. POS users can select a different storage location for returned items. The possible storage locations are shown in the following order:
  .. Storage location from order = The storage location of the item at the time it was sold.
  .. Default repair storage location = The *Default repair storage location* selected in the *Basic settings* tab of the POS.
  .. Suggested storage locations = The storage location suggestions of the warehouses linked to the variation.
  .. Used storage locations = The storage locations in which the variation is stored already.
Tell your POS staff which storage location to select for returned items.
* If the main order included shipping costs, your POS staff decides whether or not those shipping costs are refunded during the return process. Thus, you should train your staff to make sure they know when to refund shipping costs.
* Instruct your POS staff to cross out returned items on the original receipt. This helps to ensure that customers do not return items more than once.
* If the customer was issued an invoice for the original order, they only receive money back if the price of the items they want to return is higher than the invoice amount they already paid.
* The refund amount can be converted into a coupon instead of paid out in cash. If you want to do so, train POS users so your staff knows when to pay out refunds in cash and when to issue a coupon for the amount instead.

[#3100]
=== Preparing refund coupons

Instead of paying the refund amount in cash, a coupon can be issued for the refund amount. In these cases, the refund amount is paid out theoretically only and a coupon is bought from the amount at the same time. Thus, when a refund is converted into a coupon,  a return, a credit note and a new order are created.

The following preparations in the plentymarkets back end are necessary to create coupons for refunds.

* Create a coupon campaign of the type *Multipurpose coupon*.
* Create coupon items with a VAT rate of 0% and link it to the coupon campaign.
* Link coupon item for refunds with the POS.
* Assign rights to Backend user accounts.


These steps are described below. Find more detailed information on creating campaigns and coupons on the xref:orders:coupons.adoc#[Coupons] page of the manual.

== Emailing receipts to existing customers

plentymarkets allows you to set up an event procedure that automatically emails POS receipts to the email address saved for a contact data record. First create an email template with the PDF attachment *Receipt*. Then, you create an event procedure. Note that for POS orders created in <<#1100, offline mode>>, the event procedure only takes effect once the POS order is uploaded to the plentymarkets back end. Before activating an event procedure for automatic emails, check the current legal restrictions regarding emailing customers.

== Using loyalty cards

In addition to automatically emailing receipts, you can offer existing customers an additional service.  Loyalty cards with barcodes allow you to scan the barcode directly while xref:pos:plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users.adoc#30[ringing up customers]. This way, a contact is automatically selected. Just like with <<#2700, coupon cards>>, the contact is identified using the barcode printed on the customer card. Depending on the method used, the contact is identified using either the contact ID or the customer number. <<table-pos-loyalty-cards>> explains both methods and describes the preparatory steps for creating loyalty cards.

[WARNING]
.Select one method only
====
Consider in advance which method you would like to use and which way of identifying customers works best for you and the workflow in your store. Do not change the method at a later point. If you do, the correct contact data will not be found when ringing out customers.
====

[[table-pos-loyalty-cards]]
.Methods for using customer cards
|====

|Mapping via contact ID |Mapping via customer number

a|For the mapping via the contact ID, a contact data record must already exist for the customer that you would like to provide with a customer card. This method is recommended if you already have a large group of existing customers and want to provide all of them with customer cards. +

* Contact data records are managed in the back end of your plentymarkets system. xref:crm:managing-contacts.adoc#100[Add new contacts] or use the search in the *CRM » Contacts* menu to view the contact IDs for the contacts that you want to provide with loyalty cards.

a|For the mapping via the customer number, a previous contact data record does not necessarily have to exist. Thus, you can select customer numbers according to your wishes and use them as a basis for the barcodes. This way, you can also order a large amount of customer cards in advance. However, make sure to assign unique customer numbers.

* When you are handing out the customer card, add the customer number to the respective contact data record manually. To do so, enter the customer number (without prefix) in the field *Customer number* in the *CRM » Contacts » [Open contact] menu*. *Save* (icon:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

|====

As soon as you have selected a method, you can proceed with ordering the customer cards.

* Select a provider to order barcode cards with pre-printed codes. Most providers of barcode cards expect you to send a CSV file containing the individual codes that should be placed on the cards. Also, you should provide them a layout template in Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator format for the frame design.

* You can use an online tool to generate the required barcodes and send them to the provider in the requested format afterwards.

[IMPORTANT]
.Use the correct prefix
====
When generating the barcodes, add the prefix *+* (no space) to every contact ID or customer number. This prefix is needed for proper scanning and identifying of the customer data record at the POS.
====

[#1000]
== Setting up printing of POS receipts on other printers

By default, all POS receipts are printed on the receipt printer that you specify in the *plentymarkets App » Settings » POS* menu, option *Receipt printer*. However, you can also print POS receipts on other printers. For example, you might like to print receipts that need to be archived for longer periods on an A4 printer instead of on a thermal printer.

[TIP]
.Receipt printer does not require plentyBase
====
The receipt printer is connected to the plentymarkets app via the printer’s IP address. As such, you do not need plentyBase to operate the receipt printer. This means that you only need plentyBase if you want to use other printers with plentyPOS.
====

To use additional printers, you need a printer that can be accessed via the network that is connected to one or more printers on which you want to print the POS receipts. On this computer, you install the plugin xref:automation:installing-plentybase.adoc#[plentyBase]. plentyBase establishes a connection between the plentymarkets app and the local computer. This allows the POS to access any printers that the local computer can also access. Go to the plentymarkets back end menu *System » System settings » Settings » Printers* to configure these printers.

[#1010]
=== Installing and setting up plentyBase

plentyBase is a plugin developed by plentymarkets. Unlike many other plentymarkets plugin, plentyBase is not activated in the plentymarkets back end. Instead, you install and run plentyBase on a local computer. plentyBase establishes an interface that allows you to use the printers that are connected to the computer in the plentymarkets back end and/or the plentymarkets app.

The following steps are necessary to make the printers available to the plentymarkets app:

* plentyBase must be installed on the computer. +
→ Download the installation file in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentyBase_5053[plentyMarketplace^]
* plentyBase must be configured on the computer. +
→ Refer to the xref:automation:installing-plentybase.adoc#[plentyBase] page of the manual for instructions on how to set up plentyBase. +
