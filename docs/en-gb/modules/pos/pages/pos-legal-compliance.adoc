:description: When using plentyPOS, you should pay special attention to a few topics in order to ensure legal compliance. This page describes all of the necessary steps.

When using plentyPOS, there are a few aspects that you should pay attention to in order to ensure legal compliance. These aspects mostly arise from tax and financial legislation. Some of these aspects are already relevant when integrating a POS in plentymarkets, others are important in case of inspections carried out by tax and financial authorities. This manual page describes all necessary steps to ensure that your workflows with plentyPOS are legally compliant. The following instructions differentiate between running a plentyPOS in Germany and Austria, since legal requirements differ in both countries.

[#100]
== Legal compliance in Germany

The following chapters describe the required steps to be followed to ensure legal compliance of plentyPOS with German legislation.

Several regulations apply for using point of sale systems operated in Germany. Among others, the *GoBD* (German guidelines for bookkeeping) are relevant for POS operated in Germany. Data concerning POS transactions generally have to be stored in machine-readable and tamper-proof formats. Contact your tax advisor for detailed information on current legislation and discuss which data has to be exported and archived.

[#200]
=== Exporting POS transactions to PDF or CSV files

You can export the POS transactions shown in the cash journal to a PDF or CSV file. Only POS transactions that match the selected search criteria are exported. Proceed as described below to export POS transactions. Once you have started the export, you need to wait two minutes before you can start another cash journal export.

=== Creating an IDEA export

[NOTE]
.IDEA export is GoBD certified
====
The IDEA export provides data that is fully compliant to the GoBD (German regulation). If you run your POS at a location in Germany, you can download the certificate for your tax advisor or the responsible tax authorities link:https://www.plentymarkets.eu/documents/category/3339/GoBD-Export-Zertifikat-plentymarkets.pdf[here^].
====

German tax laws stipulate that you need to document all POS data and provide access to this data upon request. As a further requirement, the data must contain the meta information necessary for automated evaluation (see Grundsätze zur ordnungsmäßigen Führung und Aufbewahrung von Büchern, Aufzeichnungen und Unterlagen in elektronischer Form sowie zum Datenzugriff, GoBD for details). As such, plentymarkets provides a GoBD compliant export of the POS transactions. The export files allow tax auditors comprehensive and efficient analyses of your POS data. Proceed as described below to create an IDEA export.

→ The IDEA files are exported and saved as a ZIP file.

[#400]
=== Dealing with German cash register regulations (Kassensicherungsverordnung)

For POS that are run in German locations, the German cash register regulations (Kassensicherungsverordnung) apply. Due to these regulations, cash registers must be equipped with a so-called technical security unit (German: TSE). The TSE adds a signature to all receipts created by the POS and saves data on POS transactions in a tamper-proof file format. Ideally, you should create a TSE export once a day. In case German tax authorities carry out an inspection of your records, you are also obliged to provide an export file containing all available TSE data.

[#500]
==== Setting up a TSE unit

To link your POS to a TSE unit and thus run it in accordance with German cash register regulations, note the information in <<table-tse-unit-setup>>.

[TIP]
.Use one TSE unit per POS
====
We recommend to use a separate TSE unit for each POS. Linking one TSE unit with several POS at the same time leads to waiting times and delays when ringing up customers.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Use one TSE unit per client
====
If you have booked several clients for your plentymarkets system and run POS with more than one client, do not link POS from different clients with the same TSE unit. For instance, if have booked 2 clients and run POS for both of them, you require 2 separate TSE units.
====

[[table-tse-unit-setup]]
.Setting up a TSE unit
[cols="1,2,3"]
|====
|Order |Step |Explanation

|1\.
|Buying hardware
|Hardware bought after 1st January2020 should either be compliant with German cash register regulations or be adjustable to comply with the regulations. We recommend that you contact your hardware provider to buy new receipt printers with an integrated TSE unit. *_Or_*: Clarify with your hardware provider if the hardware you are currently using can be adjusted or not.

|2\.
|Linking a TSE unit
|Link your hardware to your cash register system. The receipt printer automatically prints a test receipt after the TSE has been linked. +
Open the plentymarkets app and click on *Settings* in the menu. Enter the IP address of the TSE unit that is printed on the test receipt. Tap *Link TSE unit*. +
In the *Basic settings* tab of the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » POS* menu, the *TSE serial number* and the *Public key* of the TSE unit are automatically entered and saved in the *Fiscalisation (Germany)* area. If needed, you can view and check the data there. If you want to set up a receipt printer manufactured by Epson, pay attention to our <<#550, tips>>.

|3\.
|Registering the TSE unit with tax authorities
|Register your TSE unit including the *Serial number* (see previous step) with your responsible tax authority. More information on the registration process will be added here as soon as it becomes available.

|====

[TIP]
.Write down the IP address of the TSE unit
====
We recommend to write down the IP address of the TSE unit separately. Also, attach a label with the corresponding IP address to the respective receipt printer after you have successfully linked the TSE unit. This way, you can easily see the IP address of the linked TSE unit in case of connection problems and thus avoid linking the wrong TSE unit. 
====

[#550]
==== Tips for linking the TSE unit

Are you using a receipt printer manufactured by Epson? If so, pay attention to the following tips before starting the process of <<#500, linking the technical security unit>> to avoid setup errors.

* Make sure that you are using the latest version of the Epson firmware. To update the firmware, use the Epson TM Utility App from link:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epson-tm-utility/id726122574[App Store^] for iOS devices or from link:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epson.tmutility&hl=en[Google Play Store^] for Android devices.

* Activate the option *ePOS-Device* in the receipt printer configuration. To do so, enter the IP address of the receipt printer in your browser’s address bar. The login credentials for this page consist of the user name *epson* and the serial number of your receipt printer as password by default. Under the menu point *Configuration*, click on *ePOS-Device* and select the option *Enable*.

* Only link one device at most to your receipt printer, e.g. the display of the receipt printer itself. If you wish to add further devices, link them using a USB hub with its own separate power supply. This way, you avoid malfunctions of the TSE that might occur due to low power supply.

[#600]
==== Ringing up customers in case of TSE unit failure

If the TSE unit fails for some reason, you can continue to ring up customers at the POS. Each receipt created after the failure itself will automatically include a note on the failure. +
However, following some additional steps is mandatory:

* Document the time the TSE unit stopped working.
* If possible, move on to a POS with a functioning TSE unit.
* If no other POS is available, you can continue using the POS with the unavailable TSE unit. All receipts are then signed with a note accordingly. This note says that the TSE unit was not working at the time the receipt was printed.
* Contact the supplier of your TSE unit or your hardware suppliere immediately to arrange for either a new TSE unit or for repair of the existing one.

[WARNING]
.Provide training to POS users
====
Train POS users carefully using the instructions provided above so that POS users know how to react to and document a possible failure of the TSE unit.
====

[#700]
==== Creating TSE exports in the plentymarkets app

We recommend that you create a TSE export once a day after creating the xref:pos:plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users.adoc#230[z report]. TSE exports are created via the plentymarkets app. After creation of the export, the export file is automatically uploaded and is available for downloading in the plentymarkets back end.

[IMPORTANT]
.Activate rights for the plentymarkets app
====
For POS users without admin access to the plentymarkets app, activate the app right *TSE unit* so that they can create TSE exports. Refer to the xref:pos:integrating-plentymarkets-pos.adoc#170[Integrating plentyPOS] manual page for further information.

2+^|*Information* area

| *Order status*
|Shows the current status of the TSE unit. +
As soon as the TSE unit has been linked successfully, the default status *INITIALIZED* is displayed.

| *Certificate valid to*
|Shows the validity date of the TSE certificate. After the displayed date, the TSE unit supplier has to be contacted to obtain a new certificate for the TSE unit. In case of expired validity, the POS can still be operated. However, the certificate has to be renewed as soon as possible.

| *Registered clients*
|Number of POS that are linked to the TSE unit. In the best case, each POS is linked to a separate TSE unit and the value *1* is displayed. It is possible to run several POS with the same TSE unit. However, in that case, delays with receipt printing may occur.

| *Initiated transactions*
|Shows the number of POS transactions that are currently executed and signed by the TSE unit.

2+^|*Signatures* area

| *Created*
|Shows the total number of signatures that have been created on the TSE unit that is currently in use. This number consists of all transactions carried out by the TSE unit in the background (signing in, changes of settings, time synchronisation) as well as every receipt signed by the TSE unit.

|===

[#925]
==== Clearing the memory of the TSE unit

The TSE unit has a built-in memory that temporarily stores information about the signature processes. If no TSE export has been created for a longer period of time, this memory is gradually taken up. This leads to the error message `Memory of TSE unit almost full` being displayed at your plentyPOS.

In this case, create a TSE export as descriped in the chapter <<#700, Creating a TSE export in the plentymarkets app>>. After the export has been created, the memory of the TSE unit is automatically cleared.

[IMPORTANT]
.Create TSE export regularly
====
The more data are stored in the memory of the TSE unit, the longer the TSE export will take to be fully created. If a lot of data is stored on the TSE unit, there is an increased risk of errors occurring during data transfer. Thus, make sure that a TSE export is created every day after the z report is created.
====

[#930]
==== Unblocking the TSE PIN

It might become necessary to reset the PIN of the technical security unit. This can be the case if the TSE has been used at another point of sale or a different location, or if a used device has been bought. As a consequence, settings within the TSE may deviate from the default settings, for example if the PIN was changed in the meantime. However, plentyPOS requires the default settings to ensure proper communication with the technical security unit. Thus, in some error cases, it can help to unblock the TSE PIN so that the PIN is reset to its default setting. You can easily carry out this step yourself in the POS menu.

[.instruction]
Unblocking the TSE PIN:

. Open the plentymarkets app.
. Tap the menu symbol at the top left of the screen. +
→ The menu opens.
. Scroll down to the *Fiscalisation* area and tap on *Unblock TSE PIN*. +
→ The TSE PIN is reset to the default setting.

[#950]
==== Creating a DSFinV-K export

The German data standards for cash register details (DSFinV-K) ensure that all POS transaction data is saved in a standard format.

DSFinV-K exports created in plentymarkets are GoBD compliant but also contain additional information. DSFinV-K exports may be requested by tax authorities for inspection purposes.

[WARNING]
.Provide training to POS users
====
In case of an inspection carried out by tax authorities, every POS user must be able to create a DSFinVK export and electronically hand over the export files. Train POS users carefully using the following instructions!
====

[discrete]
==== Assigning rights for users without admin accounts

. Click on *Download*. +
→ The export file is downloaded.

[#1000]
== Legal compliance in Austria

According to the Cash Register Directive (Registrierkassensicherheitsverordnung, RKSV) points of sale located in Austria have to be equipped with a technical signature unit that ensures that POS transaction data is temper-proof, i.e. cannot be deleted or edited. The QR code on the POS receipts provides visual proof that the POS is tamper-proof. The following chapters explain how to set up and run POS systems in Austria according to official regulations.

[#1500]
=== Overview: Implementing the POS

For POS located in Austria, the steps described in <<table-activating-POS-Austria>> are necessary to activate the signature unit required by the RKSV. Check the website of the link:https://www.bmf.gv.at/en/topics/taxation/cash-register/cash-register-directive-2012.html[Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance^] for detailed information on these legal requirements. This page of the manual describes only those steps necessary to implement a plentyPOS located in Austria. This description does not form legal or fiscal advice.

*_Tip:_* You need to scan the start receipt within a week after registering the signature card and the POS at FinanzOnline.
|====

[IMPORTANT]
.Existing POS in Austria
====
Existing POS cannot be made tamper-proof. If you already operate a plentyPOS point of sale in Austria, you need to create a new POS and decommission the old POS.
====

[#1600]
=== Creating the start receipt (Austria)

Now create the start receipt (Startbeleg) to put the POS into operation. You need the PIN of the signature certificate to create the start receipt. You should have received this PIN from your certificate service provider (Vertrauensdiensteanbieter) together with your signature card. Go to the POS menu of the plentymarkets app to create the start receipt. After the start receipt is created, the location country of the POS cannot be changed.

[.instruction]
Creating the start receipt (Startbeleg):

. Open the plentymarkets app.
. Go to *plentymarkets App » Settings » POS*.
. Enter the PIN of the signature certificate. You should have received this PIN from your certificate service provider (Vertrauensdiensteanbieter) together with your signature card.
. Tap *Create start receipt*. +
→ The start receipt is printed. +
→ The start receipt is saved in the cash journal and in the document archive. +
→ You can start using the POS. +
→ Receipts contain the electronic signature and the QR code. +
→ Transactions are saved in the data export protocol (DEP).

[#1900]
=== Creating a Z2 receipt

A Z2 receipt is a monthly signed control receipt with an amount of zero (0.00 Euro). The RKSV requires you to create a Z2 receipt at the end of each month. The Z2 report for the month of December also serves as an end of year report. You need to print and archive this yearly receipt every year and scan the barcode with the BMF receipt validation app.

[#2000]
==== Assigning users the right to create Z2 receipts

Users with admin rights are able to create Z2 receipts by default. You have to assign these rights to POS users without admin accounts.

[.instruction]
Assigning users the right to create Z2 receipts:

. Open the menu  *Setup » Account management » Roles*. +
→ The overview opens. +
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]) to search for roles.
. Open the desired role.
. Click on *Rights*.
. Activate (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the option *plentymarkets App / plentyPOS » POS functions » Z2 receipt (AT) » See*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The POS user can create Z2 receipts in plentyPOS.

[#1300]
=== Creating a Kontrollbeleg (control receipt) for tax authorities

In the case of a POS inspection by Austrian tax authorities, you need to be able to generate a zero amount control receipt (Kontrollbeleg) on the spot. This control receipt allows tax inspectors to validate the signature on the POS receipts on site in your store using a special app. You do not need any additional user rights to create a control receipt.

[.instruction]
Creating a Kontrollbeleg (control receipt) on demand:

. Log into the plentymarkets App.
. In the menu bar, tap the *menu symbol*.
. Tap *POS*. +
→ The POS menu is displayed.
. Tap *Control receipt*. +
→ The control receipt is printed. +
→ The control receipt is imported to plentymarkets and saved in the *Data » Documents » Document archive* menu. +
*_Note:_* The investigators can keep the control receipt as evidence.

[#1200]
=== Selling items with a faulty signature unit

The RKSV stipulates how you need to proceed if the signature unit of the POS fails:

* If the signature unit fails, you need to move on to a POS with a functioning signature unit.
* If no other POS is available, you can temporarily use the one with the failed signature unit.
* If the signature unit fails for more than 48 hours, you need to inform the tax authorities about the beginning and end of the failure via FinanzOnline within a week.
* All unsigned receipts must be marked *Signatureinrichtung ausgefallen* (Signature unit failed). +
→ In plentyPOS, receipts are marked with this text automatically if the signature unit fails.
* As soon as the signature unit functions again, a collective receipt (Sammelbeleg) must be created. The signature of this receipt must contain all transactions that were generated with the POS while the signature unit was not in operation. +
→ plentyPOS creates a collective receipt automatically once the signature unit functions again.

[#1700]
=== Documenting POS transactions for Austrian tax authorities

The Austrian Registrierkassensicherheitsverordnung (RKSV) stipulates that receipts must be electronically signed and furnished with a QR code. This QR code contains all relevant receipt data, an encrypted revenue counter and information on the previous receipt. This reference to the previous receipt ensures that preceding receipts cannot be manipulated or deleted. In addition, a data collection protocol (Datenerfassungsprotokoll, DEP) must be kept for each POS. You need to be able to export this DEP to a local storage medium at any time.

plentymarkets provides several export formats to allow you to comply with these legal requirements. These exports are designed to conform to German tax laws. Talk to your tax consultant to determine what data you need to export and archive to comply with local tax laws.

==== Creating a DEP export

According to §7 of the Austrian Registrierkassensicherheitsverordnung (RKSV), a data collection protocol (Datenerfassungsprotokoll, DEP) must be kept for every POS. At a minimum, the DEP must contain the signatures of any receipts resulting from cash sales and cash cancellations. The concatenation of the receipt signatures means that the DEP data is temper-proof. A separate DEP must be kept for each POS.

The DEP report is exported as a JSON file. It contains the following receipt data:

* Receipt group (Beleg-Gruppe)
* Signature certificate
* Certification authorities (Zertifizierungsstellen)
* Compact receipts (Belege-kompakt)

You must be able to export the DEP of a POS to an external disk and hand it over to tax inspectors at any time. Proceed as described below to create a DEP export.

To permanently decommission a POS located in Austria, you need to create an end receipt. An end receipt is an electronically signed control receipt with an amount of zero (0.00). An end receipt can be created for POS for which a start receipt has already been created. Go to the POS menu of the plentymarkets app to create the end receipt.
