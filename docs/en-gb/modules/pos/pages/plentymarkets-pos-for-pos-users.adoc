* Variations with <<#stock-management/managing-bbd-batch#, best before dates or batch numbers>> are not found via the item search.

* <<item/settings/properties#500, Variations with order properties>> (available from app version 1.11.8) are subject to certain limitations in plentyPOS. Proceed as described below to make these variations visible in plentyPOS.

Each multipurpose coupon has a unique coupon code. You enter this coupon code during the checkout process to apply the coupon to the items the customer wants to buy. A coupon code can only be redeemed if the code already exists in the plentymarkets system when the customer tries to redeem the coupon. From app version 1.8.1 and higher, you can redeem more than one coupon per order. When the order is created, the coupons are redeemed in the order in which you enter the coupon codes.

[#150]
==== Selling items on account

If the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment/PosInvoice_5590[plentyPOS Invoice^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]  is provisioned in the plentymarkets back end, you can also sell items on account to existing customers. However, you cannot save new customer details using plentyPOS. Customers can only pay for items on account if they are existing customers and a corresponding contact data record exists in your system. 

[TIP]
.Returning items purchased on account
====
Orders with the payment method POS invoice can be cancelled until the next z report is generated. You can also accept returns of items purchased on account. If customers have partially paid their invoice at the time of the return, plentyPOS automatically calculates the amount the customer is to be refunded.
====

[.instruction]
Buying items on account:

. Add the items <<40, to the POS basket>>.
. Open the <<135, customer data record>>. +
*_Important:_* Ensure that the customer really is the person saved in the customer data. +

[#430]
==== Receiving more than one payment method (version 1.8.5 and higher)

From version 1.8.5 of the plentymarkets app, customers can pay for the same order using more than one payment method. This allows customers who do not have enough cash on them to pay part of the order amount in cash and the rest by card.

[IMPORTANT]
.Always book payments on account last
====
Tap the *Invoice* icon to complete the order and create an invoice. The invoice shows the amount the customer still has to pay. As such, if the customer wants to pay part of the order amount later by invoice, you need to book all other payment methods before you select the *Invoice* option to complete the order.
====

After you have booked the first payment for an order, you can no longer make the following changes to the shopping cart:

* Prices, discounts and order items cannot be changed.
* The customer that you selected for the order cannot be changed.
* Multipurpose coupons cannot be redeemed.

If necessary, cancel the payments to make such changes.

. Tap *New order* to continue with ringing up the next customer at the POS.

[#440]
==== Accepting down payments

With plentyPOS, you can easily accept down payments for orders. Down payments make sense with items that have high sales prices or that are made specifically according to customer wishes. To accept down payments, the plugin link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment/PosInvoice_5590[plentyPOS Invoice^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] has to be activated in the plentymarkets back end. Also, a contact data record must exist for the customer wishing to make a down payment.
Accepting down payments is similar to <<#430, combining several payment methods>>. +
This chapter describes how to accept a partial amount as a down payment in cash or via card, and how to create an invoice for the remaining amount.

[IMPORTANT]
.Workflow only applicable to POS orders
====
 The following instruction describes how to handle down payments for orders that have been created directly at the POS. Handling down payments for other order referrers, such as <<pos/plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users#450, Click & Collect>> is not possible.

→ The order is created. +
→ The invoice is printed. Otherwise, tap *Print invoice* to print the invoice.
. Tap *New order* to continue with ringing up the next customer at the POS.

[#500]
=== Finding orders

Sometimes it’s necessary to find previous transactions and continue working with them. For example, it makes sense to find the original transaction when customers <<pos/plentymarkets-pos-for-pos-users#175, return>> items or when they <<pos/pos-online-orders#, buy items online and pick them up in the store>>.

There are two different ways to find orders:

* manually search for orders by entering the order ID or receipt number
* automatically retrieve orders by scanning a barcode

[#510]

[#520]

If you want to retrieve orders automatically, you need to print <<pos/integrating-plentymarkets-pos#120, barcodes on your customer receipts>>. Open the POS shopping cart or the order search.

[.instruction]

==== Selling a multipurpose coupon

Each multipurpose coupon has a unique coupon code. This coupon code is shown on the receipt when you sell a coupon.

==== Return information for POS invoice orders

If you allow customers to buy items on account or make down payments, customers may want to return items that are part of a partially paid or unpaid order. In such cases, plentyPOS automatically calculates if and which amount you have to pay out to customers. <<table-POS-return-invoice>> shows the calculations that plentyPOS performs in the background so that you can explain it to customers if necessary.

[[table-POS-return-invoice]]
.POS invoice returns
[cols="1,3,3"]
|====
|Invoice status |Partial return |Full return

| *Not paid*

* Returned items cost less than the unpaid invoice amount = The customer does not receive any money. +
The unpaid invoice amount is adjusted (Unpaid invoice amount minus price of the returned items). +
A credit note is created for the price of the returned items. +

* Returned items cost the same as the unpaid invoice amount = The customer does not receive any money. +
A credit note is created for the price of the returned items. +

* Returned items cost more than the unpaid invoice amount = The customer receives the balance of the unpaid invoice amount minus the price of the returned items.  +

A credit note for the returned items is created in the background. Note that the credit note amount and the refunded amount are not always the same. If the refunded amount does not match the credit note amount, the refunded amount is shown on the credit note receipt.

[#230]
=== Creating a z report

A z report documents the revenue accrued since the last z report. By generating a z report, the daily revenue is reset to 0. Z reports are assigned a sequential number and saved in plentymarkets. Depending on local law, the saving of z reports may be required for fiscal purposes. .

[TIP]
.Reprinting a z report
====
Z reports are saved in the plentymarkets back end. Go to <<orders/document-archive#, Orders » Document archive>>. Filter by the document type *Z report*. You can download the report as a PDF file from the *File* column.

[TIP]
.Why don’t I see the expected cash on hand?
====
The expected cash on hand is _not_ displayed by default. In other words, you will _not_ see how much money is expected to be in the till while you count the cash. It’s a good idea to leave the expected cash on hand hidden so that users are forced to actually count the cash themselves. If POS users see this information, they might be tempted to blindly accept the value rather than count themselves. However, if you still want to <<pos/integrating-plentymarkets-pos#50, see the expected cash on hand>>, then you can configure this setting for the POS.

[#450b]
=== Creating a till count report

A till count documents the cash on hand of a till, i.e. the amount of cash in coins and notes, at a specific point in time. For till counts, the cash on hand present in the till is physically counted. The result of this count is documented in a count log. Currently, you can enter Euro, Swiss Franc and Pound Sterling denominations.

However, if you still want to <<pos/integrating-plentymarkets-pos#50, see the expected cash on hand>>, then you can configure this setting for the POS.

==== Booking till count discrepancies

If after the count the actual cash on hand differs from the expected cash on hand, you either need to balance the discrepancy or book the difference. When you book the difference, the actual cash on hand is saved as the new expected cash on hand. At the same time, either a deposit or a withdrawal is saved depending on whether the difference is positive or negative:

* If the actual cash on hand is larger than the expected cash on hand, a deposit is booked.
* If less cash than expected is in the till, a withdrawal is booked.

When you book a till count discrepancy, the reason **Till count discrepancy** is saved automatically for this booking.
