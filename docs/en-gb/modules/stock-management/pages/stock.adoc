plentymarkets comes equipped with an integrated stock management tool. It helps sellers keep track of their current stock levels as well as their incoming and outgoing items.
For example, if you use the stock management tool, then your system can:

* automatically reserve stock for pending orders.
* reduce the stock level as soon as the item is shipped.

Such automatic stock updates help you avoid overselling.
