. Select the type *Order item*.
. Use the field *Provisioning* to determine whether the export file should be provided via HTTP or via a server.
. In the field *File name*, template variables can be entered. Example: The template variable *$day$hour.csv* inserts the respective date and the matching hour into the name of the export file.
. Use the field *Transfer* to select the interval in which a new file should be exported.

== Transmitting the export files

After using the FormatDesigner to create the format and selecting the options for the Elastic export, you only have to decide on how you would like to transmit the export file to your supplier.

Your selection for the field *Provisioning* in the *Data » Elastic export* menu is crucial here. f you have selected an FTP server, your suppliers can access data independently on that server on a daily basis. In case you want to manually transmit your data in certain cases, you can use the *Download* function in the menu*Data » Elastic export*any time to download the latest export file and process it as needed.
