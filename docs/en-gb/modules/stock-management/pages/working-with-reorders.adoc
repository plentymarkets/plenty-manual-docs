In the *Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order* menu, you do not only carry out xref:stock-management:working-with-redistributions.adoc#[redistributions], but you also create reorders. Reorders are used to reorder goods from your suppliers.

A reorder consists of the following steps:

* <<#200, Identifying variations for the reorder>>
* <<#300, Creating a reorder>>
* <<#400, Adding order items>>
* <<#500, Editing order items>>
* <<#600, Submitting additional information>>
* <<#700, Initiating and sending a reorder>>
* <<#750, Adding procurement costs to the reorder>>
* <<#800, Using the backlog list>>
* <<#900, Booking items in>>
* <<#1000, Finishing a reorder>>
* <<#1050, Cancelling a reorder>>
* <<#1100, Searching for reorders>>
* <<#1200, Automating reorders>>

[#100]
== Preparatory settings
The following chapters describe some preparatory settings. Carry them out before working with reorders for the first time. Usually, these settings only have to be made once. Set up the reorder level and the quantity suggestion for reorders to determine when items should be reordered. Create new order statuses especially for reorders and create tags to maintain a good overview. In addition, setting up a document for the *reorder* document is mandatory.

The overview table in the *Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order* menu as well as the tables in an opened redistribution are customisable. This means that you can decide which information is displayed in the table columns. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Customise table:

. Click on *Configure columns* (icon:cog[]). +
→ The window *Configure columns* opens.
. Select which columns you want to be displayed.
. Move (terra:drag_sort_handle[]) the columns so they are displayed in the order you need them.
. Click on *Confirm* to save your settings.

When you have adapted the table, these settings are saved. The table remains editable, you can change it any time.

[#110]
=== Setting up the reorder level, quantity suggestion and default settings

Prior to creating your first reorder, you should carry out the settings for the reorder level and the sales period. This way, you determine at which stock level variations are reordered.

[.instruction]
Setting up the reorder level and quantity suggestion:

. Go to the *Setup » Stock » Reorder management » Reorder » Settings* menu.
. Carry out the settings according to the information provided in <<table-reorder-level-quantity-suggestion-reorder>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

|Setting|Explanation

| *Default status*
|Select a default status that should be preselected when creating a reorder. For further information on how to set up specific statuses for reorders, refer to the chapter <<#120, Creating statuses for reorders>>.

| *Default owner*
|Select one of the available options. +
*Active owner preselected*: The user creating the reorder in the plentymarkets back end is preselected in the *Owner*. +
*No owner preselected*: If you select this option, no *Owner* is preselected when creating a new reorder.

| *Sales period*
|Select a period of time. The sales period defines which period of time will be used to calculate the average consumption of the variation. The average consumption is relevant for suggesting a reorder quantity for a variation. The quantity suggestion for individual variations is displayed in the *Stock » Stocks* menu.

| *Default value for reorder level/order quantity*
a|This setting determines the way in which the order quantity for the quantity suggestion for the reorder is calculated. +
You can choose between: +
*Reorder level - net stock - ordered quantity* or +
*(Reorder level - net stock - ordered quantity) + (Average consumption (Replacement time + Stock turnover (in days))* +
 +
Parameters used for suggesting a reorder quantity:

* *Reorder level* = the quantity at which a reorder should be placed. You can select a static or dynamic reorder level.
* *Net stock* = the quantity of stock that can be sold.
* *Ordered quantity* = the quantity that you already ordered from your supplier, but that is still to be delivered.
* *Average consumption* = the average quantity consumed or or sold per day. The sales period that you select defines the period of time that will be used to calculate the average consumption per day.
* *Replacement time* = the time needed by a supplier to deliver the ordered variations. The number of days required by the supplier to deliver a variation needs to be entered in the *Supplier* tab of a variation.
* *Stock turnover (in days)* = The stock turnover (in days) saved. The stock turnover (in days) represents the number of days that you want your stock to last. The stock turnover (in days) is saved for each variation per warehouse in the *Warehouse* tab of the variation.

| *Source for item name*
|Select from the drop-down list which item name is displayed in the reorder. *Name 1*, *name 2* and *name 3* are assigned in the *text* tab of the item data of an item or a variation.

| *Default sorting*
|Select from the drop-down list in which order the order items of a reorder are sorted.

| *Default value for partial delivery*
|Select from the drop-down list which value is preselected in the *Subset* column in the order items of a reorder. The values remain editable in the reorder, irrespective of the chosen default value. +
*0* = No value is entered. +
*Total open amount* = The ordered amount still open are entered.

| *Default sender*
|If you select one of your suppliers as default sender, this supplier is preselected when you create a new reorder.

| *Default receiver*
|If you select one of your warehouses as default receiver, this warehouse is preselected when you create a new reorder.

|*Filter option "Restrict to supplier" is preselected in item search*
|Activate this option for it to be preselected in the item search. It means that only items of the supplier selected in the order details are displayed in the search results.

|*Filter option "Only display active items" is preselected in item search*
|Activate this option for it to be preselected in the item search. It means that only xref:item:checklist-items-visibility.adoc#100[activated items] are displayed in the search results.

|*Display of added items in the shopping cart*
|Select how items are added to the shopping cart. The default setting is *As one order position, quantities of order items are increased*. +
*As separate order positions* = Same items are added separately as well, meaning that each item is displayed in a separate row. +
*As one order position, quantities of order items are increased* = Same items are added as one order item, only the quantities are adapted.

[#120]
=== Creating statuses for reorders
A certain number of statuses is saved in your plentymarkets system by default. Those default order statuses can also be used for reorders. However, you can also create a number of individual statuses for particular uses. Creating new order statuses is described in detail in the respective chapter on the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1200[Managing orders] page of the manual.

[TIP]
.Creating own statuses for reorders
====
We recommend setting up separate statuses that you use exclusively for working with the order type *reorder*. Make sure that the statuses can be distinguished from the statuses used for other order types by assigning different names.
====

[#130]
=== Creating tags for reorders
Tags are keywords that you create centrally before you can use them in different areas of your plentymarkets system. How to use tags for reorders and which user rights are required is explained below.

[#140]
=== Setting up the reorder document
The *reorder document* is a specific document that serves as an order form for the reorder. This document contains information on all variations included in the reorder. You as the seller send it to your supplier. +
The document template for the *reorder document* has to be set up before creating such a document for the first time. As long as no document template has been set up, the reorder document cannot be created. To create the template you can either apply the default template or you can carry out your own settings. Both ways of setting up the template are described below.

[.instruction]
Applying the default template for the *reorder document*:

. Go to the *Setup » Stock » Reorder management » Reorder » Documents* menu.
. Open the *Transfer* tab.
. Select the language from the drop-down list above the tab title.
. In the *Apply settings from default document template* area, click on *Accept*. +
→ The default document template is applied to the document.

[.instruction]
Carrying out individual settings for the *reorder document* template:

. Go to the *Setup » Stock » Reorder management » Reorder » Documents* menu.
. Stay in the *Template* tab.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-document-settings-reorder>>. +
→ Use the *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) to check the settings.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The chosen settings are applied to the document.

You can find more information about document templates, for example linking a PDF template, in the manual section xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#1700[Order documents].

[#150]
=== Preparing to send the reorder document
After setting up the document template for the reorder document in the previous step, you should carry out the settings for sending the document to make sure that your supplier receives your reorder data. First you need to set up an email template that contains the reorder document attached as PDF. The basic steps for setting up the email template are described in the following. For further information about email templates, refer to the xref:crm:sending-emails.adoc#1200[Sending emails] page of the manual.

[.instruction]
Setting up an email template:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates*.
. Click on *New email template*.
. Enter a name, for example "Reorder document to supplier”.
. Select the owner or owners for whom the email template should be available.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Select the option *Reorder (PDF)* from the drop-down menu *PDF attachment*.
. Click on the *Email message* tab.
. Enter a subject.
. Enter the text that should be included in the email template.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

In the next step, you can automate sending the reorder document to your supplier. This way, the reorder document is automatically sent to your supplier after it has been generated.

Set up the following event procedure.

[.collapseBox]
.Automatically sending the reorder document to the supplier:
--
. Go to *Setup » Orders » Events*.
. Click on *Add event procedure*.  +
→ The *Create new event procedure* window opens.
. Enter a name.
. Select the *event* listed in <<table-event-procedure-reorder-document-to-supplier>>.
. *Save* the settings.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-event-procedure-reorder-document-to-supplier>>.
. Place a check mark next to the option *Active*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#160]
=== Defining the reorder level of a variation
If you wish to be notified as soon as it is time to reorder variations, you should set up a reorder level for each variation in your plentymarkets system. The reorder level represents the quantity that is left in stock at which a variation should be reordered.

[TIP]
.Set up warehouses to enter the reorder level
====
You can only enter a reorder level if you have assigned a warehouse to the variation. If you have not yet xref:item:managing-items.adoc#312[assigned a warehouse], do so beforehand.
====

[.instruction]
Entering a static reorder level:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » Open item » Open variation » Edit variation » Tab: Warehouse*.
. Enter a quantity for the *reorder level*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Displaying items below the reorder level on the dashboard of your system
====
You can add an element that shows you variations that are below the reorder level on the dashboard of your system. Displayed there are items below reorder level, that are active, and without item bundles. To do so, add the element *Items below reorder level*. By clicking on the number of variations, you can open the *Stock » Stocks* menu and filter the variations that are below the reorder level. _Note_ that also items with negative net stock for which no reorder levels are maintained are displayed on the dashboard.
====

[#dynamicReorderLevel.subhead]
Status of the dynamic reorder level

For each warehouse, you can decide whether you would like to use the dynamic reorder level or not. If you use the dynamic reorder level, your system calculates the dynamic reorder level automatically every night. This calculated reorder level is then displayed in the table column *RL* in the *Stock » Stocks* menu. +
The difference to the reorder level, the RLΔ, is also calculated based on this calculated reorder level. The values is displayed to you e.g. in the stock overview. This way, you can identify the variations that have to be reordered in the stock overview.

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not save a static reorder level while using the dynamic reorder level
====
If you use the dynamic reorder level, you must not enter a static reorder level manually. Leave the reorder level for the variations in the warehouse on 0. If a reorder level bigger than 0 is saved manually, the calculation of the dynamic reorder level is not carried out.
====

The dynamic reorder level is calculated each night using the following formula:

latexmath:[\mbox{Dynamic reorder level} = {(\mbox{Ø Sales period} \cdot \mbox{Stock turnover}) + (\mbox{Ø Sales period} \cdot \mbox{Shortest delivery period})}]

Explanation of the parameters:

* Ø Sales period = Average quantity of items sold
* Shortest delivery period = Shortest delivery period, regardless of which supplier

The difference to the dynamic reorder level (RLΔ) is carried out by the system and is calculated as follows:

latexmath:[\mbox{RLΔ} = {(\mbox{Dynamic reorder level} - (\mbox{Net stock} + (\mbox{reordered quantity})}]

Set up the dynamic reorder level for each warehouse in the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#300[warehouse settings].

[#170]
=== Defining the minimum order quantity of a variation
The minimum order quantity is the quantity that you need to order as a minimum from your supplier. The suggested reorder quantity will be at least as hight as the minimum entered here. However, you will only get a suggestion if the reorder level has been reached.

[TIP]
.Assign a supplier to enter a minimum order quantity
====
You can only enter a minimum order quantity if you have assigned a supplier to the variation. If you have not yet xref:item:managing-items.adoc#310[assigned a supplier], do so now.
====

[.instruction]
Defining the minimum order quantity of a variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » Open item » Edit variation » Tab: Supplier*.
. Enter a minimum order quantity.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the setting.

The reorder suggestion remains on 0 if you do not enter a reorder level.

[#180]
=== Assigning rights

*Back end* type users xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#105[can only see certain areas and menus] in plentymarkets. This means they only have limited access to the system. If you want *back end* type users to create and process reorders, you have to grant them the following rights:

* *CRM > Contact > Show*
* *CRM > Message > Show*
* *Items > Item > Variation > Show*
* *Items > Settings > Edit*
* *Orders > Show*
* *Orders > Order items > Transactions*
* *Orders > Purchase order*
* *Orders > Booking*
* *Orders > Documents > Create*
* *Orders > Documents > Show*
* *POS > Show*
* *Setup > Property > Show*
* *Setup > Tag > Create*
* *Setup > Tag > Delete*
* *Setup > Tag > Show*
* *Stock > Reorder*
* *Stock > Show*
* *Stock > Warehouses*
* *Stock > Warehouse location management*

[.collapseBox]
.*Tip: How to grant rights*
--

Note that only *Admins* can grant rights.

[.instruction]
Assigning rights:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*. +
→ The user accounts are displayed in an overview.
. Click on a user account. +
→ The *Rights* menu item containing the visibilities opens.
. Assign the rights for the respective area by ticking the check boxes indicated above. +
*_Note_*: You can either grant rights for complete areas or limit the rights you grant the user. To only grant limited rights in a certain area, expand the area.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
======
The *Rights* and *Menu visibilities* are linked. This means that if you grant a right in one of the two areas, plentymarkets automatically grants the corresponding rights in the other area.
======

--

[#190]
=== Using the messenger

Use the messenger to create notes about your contacts in the back end. These notes are only visible in your plentymarkets back end and cannot be accessed by your contacts.
To use the messenger, click on *Messenger* on the left-hand side of the reorder menu or open the messenger in the lower area of the reorder menu.

[.instruction]
Proceed as follows to create a new note:

. Click on *New message* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ A text editing field opens and a timer starts.
. Select one or more recipients.
. Enter the title.
. Enter the text. +
→ The editing window also offers you formatting options for the note.
. Use *Attach files* to attach a file, if required.
. Click on *Send* (icon:envelope-o[role="purple"]).
. Decide whether this is part of a service and needs to be billed by selecting *Billable* and entering the corresponding minutes.

The message is automatically linked to the order ID of the reorder as soon as you have sent the message. After you have completed all related tasks, you can mark the message as closed.

Select whether you want to have the messages sorted in descending or ascending order by choosing the *Sorting* from the drop-down list accordingly.

For further information about the messenger, refer to the xref:crm:messenger.adoc#[Messenger] page of the manual.

[#200]
== Identifying variations for the reorder
To manage your stocks effectively, it is important to identify variations that have to be reordered in time before you run out of them. This way, you avoid running out of stocks and thus having to inform your customers about longer delivery periods.

The variations that have to be reordered are most easily identified by checking them for their reorder levels. If you have not set up reorder levels, you can alternatively filter variations by their net stock.

[.instruction]
Identifying variations for the reorder:

. Go to *Stock » Stocks*.
. Select the option *Reorder level reached/below* for the *limitation* filter. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Select the option *Negative net stock or net stock equals 0* if you have not set up reorder levels.
. Select a warehouse (optional).
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ A list of variations that should be reordered is displayed.

[#300]
== Creating a reorder

Depending on your needs, your plentymarkets system offers you different methods to create reorders. You can either reorder items directly when they are below reorder level or reorder items for specific warehouses and suppliers. You can also create a reorder directly from an order or reorder individual variations specifically. All of these approaches are explained in the following chapters so that you can choose one according to your needs and workflow.

[#310]
=== Reordering variations below reorder level

When an item is below reorder level you can create a reorder. The items below reorder level are displayed as described in chapter <<#200, Identifying variations for the reorder>>. The following steps have to be carried out after filtering for the variations mentioned above.

[.instruction]
Creating a reorder:

. Go to *Stock » Stocks*.
. Carry out a search for variations that have reached or are below reorder level according to the explanations provided in <<#200, Identifying variations for the reorder>>.  +
. Click on *Accept suggestion* to use the suggested reorder quantity. +

== Adding order items

In chapter 3, several methods for creating a reorder in your plentymarkets system have been described. Now, you can enter further variations to the reorder by adding order items. Carry out a search (material:search[]) to find the required order items and to add them to the reorder.

[.collapseBox]
.*Search functions*
--
There are several ways of using the search. You can enter a value in the search field and then select the required filter. When you enter a number or a letter, available filters are suggested, e.g. order ID or variation number. Enter the value in full and then select the required filter from the suggestions. Repeat this to combine filters. Click on *Search* (material:search[]) to carry out the search. +
If you first want to select a filter from the filter list, click on *Filter* l(material:tune[]). The available filters are displayed. Enter a value in the required filter. Click on *Search* once you have set all needed filters. +
Remove the chip if you want to delete a set filter. Available filters are explained in <<table-filter-item-search-reorder>>.

Additionally, you can save selected filters in the UI by using the *Saved filters* (material:bookmarks[]) component. The saved filters can then be selected from this component every time you open or work with this menu, similar to bookmarks. Every user can save own filter sets.

[.instruction]
Saving filters:

. Set the filters with the required values
. Carry out the search.
. Click on *Saved filters* (material:bookmarks[]).
. Click on *Save current filter* (material:bookmark_border[]). +

. Click on *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) in the *Cart* area. +
→ The cart is saved. +
→  The reorder opens.

_Note_ that the reorder has now been created but was not executed yet. This means that the reorder was not conveyed to the supplier yet. Before executing and finishing a reorder you can add further information in the *Details* area of the reorder. Refer to the following chapters for this. When you execute the reorder now, the order items are no longer editable.

== Editing order items

After adding the order items to the cart, you can edit them in the *Order items* area. For example, you can change the *Quantity* or *delete* order items.
In the *Purchase price* field, you can change the pre-entered purchase price in case your supplier has agreed to a price change on short notice. In the *Item name* field, you can change the name of the item. The adaptations are only valid for the reorder they are done in. If you want to adapt the xref:item:settings.adoc#[item setting] in general, you have to do so in the *Item » Edit item* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Editing the purchase price for variations
====
Editing the purchase price may affect the prices for variations already saved in your system.
If one of the options *Save purchase price in variation data* or *Save purchase price in variation and supplier data* is activated for the *Purchase price* in the *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items* menu, the previously saved purchase price for the variation is overwritten by your entry during the reorder. For more detailed information on these settings, refer to the xref:stock-management:new-incoming-items.adoc#300[Managing incoming items] page of the manual.
====

Once you have made all necessary changes to the order items, click on *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) in the *Cart* area.

[#600]
== Submitting additional information
The *Details* area of the reorder offers you the possibility to submit additional information for a reorder. <<table-additional-information-reorder>> describes the possible information.

[[table-additional-information-reorder]]
.Additional information for a reorder
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Delivery date*
|You can enter a delivery date manually or use the function *Calculate delivery date*. The system then calculates the estimated delivery date on the basis of the *Delivery time* saved in the *Supplier tab* of the variations included in the reorder. To be calculated correctly, the delivery times have to be added and saved before the reorder is created. For more information on saving the delivery time for a variation, refer to the xref:item:managing-items.adoc#180[Managing items] page of the manual. +
When you set a delivery date in the order details, you can choose whether the same date is also set for order items in the table without a delivery date. Already set delivery dates in the table are not overwritten by this. +
You can set an individual delivery date for every order item in the table. The delivery dates remain editable as until the reorder is completed. +
_Note_ that all delivery dates in the table are deleted if you delete an already set delivery date in the order details. It is not possible to set a delivery date that is earlier than the order initiated date. +
Click on *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) after setting or editing the delivery date.

| *Payment due date*
|Choose the date you want to set as the due date for the payment manually. Alternatively, use the function *Calculate payment due date* to set the current date.

| *Dealer sign*
|Enter the supplier's dealer sign.

| *Owner*
|Select a user who should be determined as the person responsible for the reorder. Alternatively, the <<#200, default owner>> is displayed in this field in case you have made the corresponding settings.

| *Currency*
|The system currency is displayed in this field by default. If needed, enter a different *Currency* for the supplier as well as the *Exchange rate* that is currently valid for the currency. The *Details* area will then include a display of the calculated *Net order value*.

|====

Above the order details of an already created reorder, info boxes with basic information about the reorder are displayed. The status of these is displayed by different colours.

* Order ID = The ID of the current reorder.
* Net order value = The net order value of the ordered items is displayed. Grey means that the value is zero (e.g. because the reorder has not been initiated yet). Green means that the value is above zero.
* Ordered items = The number of ordered items is displayed. This info box is always grey.
* Open items = The number of items not yet delivered is displayed. Grey means that no items are open because the reorder has not been initiated yet. Green means that no items are open because all of them have been delivered. Orange means that items are open.
* Delivered items = The number of already delivered items is displayed. Grey means that no items were delivered yet. Orange means that the items were partially delivered and green that all the items of this reorder were delivered.
* Cancelled items = The number of cancelled items is displayed. Grey means that no items were cancelled. Black means that at least one item was cancelled.
* Procurement costs in total = The total of procurement costs is displayed. Grey means that the total is zero. Red means that the total is above zero.

[#700]
== Initiating and sending a reorder
After adding all variations that should be reordered to the reorder, you set the order date. To do so, click on *Initiate order* in the *Details* area. The reorder is initialised and the current date is set as the order date. +
Alternatively, you can manually set a date with the date picker (icon:calendar[]). After selecting a date, click on *Initiate order*. The selected date is set as the order date and the reorder is initialised.

[WARNING]
.Order items cannot be edited any more
====
As soon as you have set the order date, you cannot add any more order items to the reorder or delete them. Thus, only set the order date after carefully checking whether the reorder is complete.
====

After initiating the order, you still need to send the reorder to your supplier. To do so, generate the *Reorder* document. The chapter on <<#150, Preparing to send the reorder document>> already explained how to set up the document template and how to automatically send the document to your supplier. In the following, you find instructions on how to generate the document manually and automatically.

[delete-reorder]
[TIP]
.Deleting a reorder
====
Reorders can be deleted in the detail view as long as the reorder has not been initiated by setting the order date. To delete a reorder, click on *Delete purchase order* (icon:trash-o[]) in the right-hand corner above the info boxes.

→ A window for selecting the email template opens in a new tab.
. Select the email template that should be sent to the supplier.
. Click on the *eye* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) to open the preview.
. If necessary, edit the text of the email. +
*_Note_*: Changing the text only affects the email you are editing. The email template itself is not changed.
. Click on the *envelope* (icon:envelope-o[role="purple"]) to send the email.

[#750]
== Adding procurement costs to the reorder

Different costs arise when stock is reordered. These can be added to a reorder in the *Procurement costs* area. This way, all known additional costs are saved as properties in the reorder and are displayed so that you can see all relevant information. The additional procurement costs are displayed in the same currency as the one selected for the reorder.

The following procurement costs can be added:

* Freight charge
* Packaging charge
* Transport insurance
* Drayage
* Postage
* Customs duties
* Brokerage fee
* Small quantity surcharges
* Other charges

The procurement costs can only be added when the reorder was created and initiated. Before this is not done, the input fields for the different costs in the *Procurement costs* area of the reorder are disabled.

When no costs were added yet, *Not set* is displayed. Directly click in this field of the respective costs you want to add and manually insert the corresponding amount. Allowed are amounts with a maximum of 2 decimal places. The costs are automatically added in the same *currency* as the one set for the reorder.  *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the reorder after you added the costs. The reorder is then updated.

[IMPORTANT]
.Costs with 0
====
Because the costs are saved as properties, they will be deleted and not saved if the costs are set to 0 in one of the fields.
====

You can also edit or delete costs by clicking in the respective field and carry out the required adaptations. After you changed costs, click on *save* (icon:save[role="green"]) to update them.

[.discrete]
=== Using the procurement costs calculator

Depending on your workflow, suppliers and reorders, not all of the procurement costs may be charged in the same currency. You can use the *Procurement costs calculator* so that all costs of the reorder listed above are displayed in the same currency. The calculator is located next to each cost and opens when you click on it. Take into account the explanations given in <<table-settings-procurement-costs-calculator>>.

[[table-settings-procurement-costs-calculator]]
.Settings of the procurement costs calculator for additional costs in the reorder
[cols="1,3"]

|Setting |Explanation

| *Amount*
|The amount is set to 0 by default. Enter the amount of the respective cost in the currency it is charged in for this reorder.

| *Currency*
|Select the currency in which the amount for this cost is charged.

| *Exchange rate*
|An exchange rate is calculated by the system but can be adjusted manually. The currency selected in the procurement costs calculator is converted into the currency set for the reorder.

| *Preview amount in*
|The amount converted into the currency of the reorder is shown. This is the amount which is added to the selected procurement cost.
|====

Click on *Add cost* when everything is set and the costs are correct. Note that the costs are *not saved yet*. Click on *save* (icon:save[role="green"]) in the reorder to save the added costs and thus to update the reorder.

[#800]
== Using the backlog list
If you have reordered a large quantity of variations or several reorders are pending at the same time, use the backlog list to keep track of all variations that you have reordered, but that have not been delivered yet. These variations are displayed in the *Stock » Reorder management » Backlog list* menu. For further information on the backlog list, refer to the xref:stock-management:managing-backlog-lists.adoc#[Managing backlog lists] page of the manual.

[#900]
== Booking items in
As soon as the reordered variations arrive at your warehouse, they have to be booked in. Depending on whether all variations included in the reorder arrive at once or whether they arrive in separate deliveries, you book in <<#910, partial quantities>> or <<#920, all variations>> in one step. Both approaches are explained in the following sections.

[IMPORTANT]
.Storage location for booking variations in
====
If you have not set up separate warehouses and storage locations for your variations in your plentymarkets system, the variations are booked into the Default storage location that exists in your system by default.
====

[.collapseBox]
.*Customising the Stock movements table*

.Unlocking a reorder
====
In case you have set the finish date by mistake, unlock the reorder by clicking on *Unlock purchase order* (icon:undo[role="orange"]). This way, the reorder is unlocked and can be edited again.
====

You should also finish the reorder if it is clear that particular variations included in the reorder will definitely not be delivered to your warehouse, for example due to loss during the delivery process. This way, the undelivered order items will also be removed from the xref:stock-management:managing-backlog-lists.adoc#[Backlog list].

[#1050]
== Cancelling a reorder

You cancel a reorder in the details view of a reorder, e.g. when open quantities will not be delivered anymore.

[.instruction]

* Currency
* Dealer sign
* Order items (incl. the properties discount, package unit, minimum purchase, original quantity, delivery time in days, external order ID, supplier item name)
* Tags

No dates are copied, you can set these in the newly created reorder. The *owner* is not copied as well. The current user is set as the owner of the reorder. The *status* is set to the xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#120[default status for reorders] defined by you.

The behaviour of the new reorder is the same as that of other reorders. You can edit the reorder as you are used to until you set the xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#1000[finish date].

[#1100]
== Searching for reorders

When opening the *Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order* menu, all existing reorders and xref:stock-management:working-with-redistributions.adoc#[redistributions] are displayed. Carry out a search (material:search[]) to limit the search results to the required redistributions.

== Automating reorders
Reorders can be partly automated with the help of the event procedures available in your plentymarkets system. One possibility of automating the generation of the reorder document has already been described in the <<#720, Automatically generating a reorder document>> chapter. In the *Setup » Orders » Events* menu, the events, filters and procedures available in the groups named *Purchase order* allow you to automate certain steps of the reorder. +

For more detailed information on setting up event procedures, refer to the xref:basics:event-procedures.adoc#[Event procedures] page of the manual. If you are working with event procedures for the first time, pay attention to the information provided on creating event procedures in the chapter xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#100[Creating a new event procedure].
