The plentyWarehouse app includes a function for reshelving items. You can find information about it on this page. First, you'll read a short description of the function to help you understand the concept. Then you’ll learn about the xref:app:reshelving.adoc#200[settings], which need to be carried out once in advance. These settings go into effect when you begin using the function.

== How are items reshelved?

Click on the box below to learn more about the process of reshelving.

[.collapseBox]
.Workflow for reshelving items
--
All of the items start out in the same spot. For example, maybe cashiers put returned items in a box behind the sales counter. Or maybe, incoming items are always stored at a specific area of your warehouse and are transferred to permanent storage location later.

When the warehouse staff is ready to put the items into the racks, the plentyWarehouse app is opened. First, the storage location from which the items are taken is selected.

Afterwards, the app lists all of the items that are currently at the selected storage location. Employees select the first item. Then, the storage location to which the item should be reshelved is selected in the app.

The plentyWarehouse app automatically switches back to the list of items waiting to be reshelved. The warehouse staff repeat this process until all items have been reshelved or the reshelving function is exited manually.

|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+| *General settings* area

| *Suggest total quantity*
|Select if the total quantity of the variation should be suggested for reshelving. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = The total quantity of the variations available at the storage location is automatically inserted. +
*Deactivated* (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) = No quantity will be suggested. You will have to enter the quantity manually. +

| *Number of items to scan individually*
|If you are registering items via scanning them, you can use this setting to determine how many variations you have to scan individually until the available total quantity is inserted automatically in the field for entering the quantity. +
*_Example:_* If you enter the number *5* in the quantity field, the total quantity is inserted automatically after you have scanned the variation five times.

| *Show net stock*
|Activate this option to display the respective <<glossary#net-stock, net stock>> when reshelving items.

2+| *Source storage location* area

| *Storage location search fields*
|Use the toggle buttons to determine which criteria can be used for the storage location search while using the reshelving function. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = You will be able to use this criterion when searching for storage locations.. +
*_Tip:_* Tap on (icon:drag_handle[set=material]) for each activated search criterion and drag it to the desired position to determine the order of the search fields.

| *Focus on storage location search field*
|Will you typically <<#400, select the source storage location>> by scanning its barcode or by searching for the storage location name and selecting the storage location from a list? If you want to scan the barcode, then this setting can speed up the job. +
*None* = There will be no focus on any field. Of course, you can still place the cursor in another search field manually.
*Barcode* = The cursor will automatically start out in the barcode field when you reshelve items. You can scan the source storage location right away. +
*Storage location name* = The cursor is automatically placed in the storage location name field.

| *Number of storage locations to be loaded*
|Select the number of search results you want to see at once.

| *Source warehouse*
|Should a specific warehouse be preselected as the source warehouse every time you redistribute items? Then select the desired warehouse. +
*None* = No source warehouse will be preselected. +
*_Note:_* This setting only takes effect if you also select one or more options for the setting <<#option-purpose, *Purpose*>>.

| [#option-purpose]*Purpose*
|Where are your items located before they are reshelved? Tap on the desired xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#intable-purpose[storage location purposes] to include them in or exclude them from the reshelving function. +
*_Example:_*Select the storage location purposes *Incoming stock* and *Return* if you want to reshelve goods that you’ve received from your supplier as well as returned items. +
*_Use case:_* During reshelving, the app will suggest storage locations that you might want to reshelve. You’ll only be suggested the source storage locations that meet these criteria.

2+| *Item search* area

| *Item search fields*
|Use the toggle buttons to determine which criteria can be used for the item search while using the reshelving function. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = You will be able to use this criterion when searching for items. +
*_Tip:_* Tap on (icon:drag_handle[set=material]) for each activated search criterion and drag it to the desired position to determine the order of the search fields.

| *Focus on item search field*
|Do you typically search for items using a specific criterion? Tap on the criterion that you use most frequently. When you search for items later, the cursor will automatically be placed in this field at the beginning. Of course, you can still place the cursor in another search field manually.

| *Number of items to be loaded*
|Determine how many search results should be displayed at once if you search for items during reshelving.

2+| *Target storage location* area

| *Mandatory item scan*
|Use this option to determine which rules should apply when registering target storage locations when reshelving items. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = All target storage locations _must_ be scanned via their label to be registered for reshelving. It is not possible to select storage locations manually via the search results. +
*Deactivated* (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) = Storage locations can either be registered by scanning them or by selecting them manually.

| *Suggested storage location list*
|Where do you want to put the items once they’ve been reshelved? Use the toggle buttons to include or exclude specific types of storage locations. +
*Used storage locations* = Storage locations where variations are already stored. +
*Suggested storage locations* = Storage locations that are xref:stock-management:new-incoming-items.adoc#200[linked to a variation]. +
*Empty storage locations* = All available storage locations. +
*_Note:_* Depending on the number of storage locations, the setting *Empty storage locations* can significantly slow down the reshelving process. As such, we recommend that you link variations to storage locations and only activate empty storage locations if strictly necessary. +
*_Use case:_* During reshelving, the app will suggest storage locations that you might want to reshelve. You’ll only be suggested the source storage locations that meet these criteria. If you want to use a storage location that _was not suggested_, then you’ll have to scan the storage location rather than select it from the list of suggestions in the app.

| *Purpose*
|Use this option to exclude storage locations with specific xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#intable-purpose[purposes] from the list of suggested storage locations. +
*_Example:_* Deactivate (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) the purpose *Incoming items* so that items are not reshelved to storage locations with this purpose and do not get confused with other stock when incoming items are booked.

== Assigning rights for reshelving items

Before items are reshelved in plentyWarehouse, make sure that all users have been assigned the appropriate rights. Otherwise, items cannot be reshelved correctly and the stock changes cannot be saved in the plentymarkets back end.

== Reshelving items

Now, proceed as described below to reshelve items with plentyWarehouse.

[IMPORTANT]
.Are any items available?
====
Items can only be reshelved with plentyWarehouse if they are stored at the correct storage location. If no items are currently stored at the selected storage location, then no items will be displayed for reshelving.
====

[#400]
=== Selecting the source storage location

First, select the storage location from which the items should be reshelved.

[.instruction]
Selecting the source storage location:

. xref:stock-management:installation-and-initial-setup.adoc#300[Log into plentyWarehouse].
. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]) in the top left corner. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Find the *Reshelving* tile in the *Functions* area on the dashboard.
. Tap on *Reshelving* (image:stock-management:icon_reshelving.png[width=14, height=14]).
. Search for the storage location whose items should be reshelved. To do so, enter the name of the storage location or scan the barcode on the storage location label. +
*_Optional:_* Tap on (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]) to filter the search results by the *Purpose* of the storage location.
. Tap on *Search* (icon:search[role="darkGrey"]). +
→ The available storage location are displayed.

[#500]
=== Selecting items

After you have <<#400, selected a source storage location>>, plentyWarehouse automatically displays a list of all items that are available at this storage location.
plentymarkets automatically makes a list of all the items currently at this storage location. Duplicate items are grouped together. For example, if two copies of an item need to go back on the shelf, then the employee can specify the item quantity directly during reshelving.

The list includes important information about the items that are ready to be reshelved. For example, the employee sees the item ID and the item name. You can control which information is displayed on the list. Simply create a xref:app:reshelving.adoc#200[template].

[.instruction]
Working with the item list:

. Look at the list to find out which items need to be reshelved.
. Decide which item you want to reshelve first.
. Scan the item's barcode or tap on the item in the app.

[#600]
=== Reshelving items

Where do you want to reshelve the items? plentyWarehouse displays a list of all suggested target storage locations. Simply scan the storage location barcode or tap on a storage location in the app.

[.instruction]
Reshelving items:

. Put the item on the appropriate place on the shelf.
. Scan the barcode of this storage location or tap on the storage location in plentyWarehouse. +
→ plentymarkets changes the item’s storage location. A xref:stock-management:managing-stocks.adoc#1100[stock movement] is automatically created in your plentymarkets system. +
→ If other items need to be reshelved from the source storage location, the screen will switch back to the item list and you can continue with the next item.

[TIP]
.Multiple copies of an item
====
Identical items are grouped together in plentyWarehouse. For example, if two copies of an item need to be reshelved, you can specify the item quantity while reshelving. Simply scan the item multiple times. Every time you scan the item, the number automatically increases by one. Alternatively, tap on *Quantity* and enter the number manually.
