:author: team-stock, team-order-core

To redistribute stock between different warehouses you create a redistribution in your plentymarkets system. You do this in the same menu where you create and edit reorders, namely in the *Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order* menu. In this menu, there is not only an overview table with your redistributions and reorders available, you can also add new reorders or redistributions as well as search for them or edit them.
A redistribution consists of the following steps:

* <<#600, Creating a redistribution>>
* <<#700, Adding order items>>
* <<#800, Generating a PO delivery note>>
* <<#900, Booking items out>>
* <<#1000, Booking variations in>>
* <<#1100, Finishing a redistribution>>

All of the steps are explained in this chapter of the manual. As a first step, we recommend carrying out some <<#100, preparatory settings>> before you create and process your first redistribution.

[#100]
== Preparatory settings
To optimise your workflow using warehouse redistributions, we recommend carrying out some preparatory settings. Create new order statuses especially for redistributions and create tags to keep a good overview. Setting up a document template for the *PO delivery note* is required as well.

The overview table in the *Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order* menu as well as the tables in an opened redistribution are customisable. This means that you can decide which information is displayed in the table columns. To do so, proceed as follows:

[.instruction]
Customising tables:

. Click on *Configure columns* (material:settings[]). +
→ The window *Configure columns* opens.
. Select which columns are to be displayed.
. Move (material:sort[]) the columns so they are displayed in the order you need them in.
. Click on *Confirm* to save your settings.

When you have adapted the table, these settings are saved. The table remains editable, you can change it any time.

[#150]
=== Carrying out default settings
You can determine default settings to reduce the workload involved in creating a new redistribution. The default settings are then automatically displayed in the data fields when creating a new redistribution. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Carrying out default settings:

. Go to the *Setup » Stock » Reorder management » Redistribution » Settings* menu.
. Carry out the settings according to the information provided in <<table-default-settings-redistribution>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +

[[table-default-settings-redistribution]]
.Default settings for redistributions
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Default status*
|Select a Default status that should be preselected when creating a redistribution. How to create statuses for redistributions is explained in chapter xref:stock-management:working-with-redistributions.adoc#200[Creating statuses for redistributions].

| *Default owner*
|Select one of the available options. +
*Active user preselected*:The user creating the redistribution in the plentymarkets back end is preselected in the *Owner* field. +
*No owner preselected*:The *Owner* field remains empty when creating a new redistribution. +
Moreover, all users set up in your system are shown in the dropdown-list as well. If you select one of those users, this user is preselected when a new redistribution is created.

| *Source for item name*
|Select from the drop-down list which item name is displayed in the redistribution. *Name 1*, *name 2* and *name 3* are assigned in the *text* tab of the item data of an item.

| *Default sender*
|If you select one of your warehouses as default sender, this warehouse is preselected when you create a new redistribution as the warehouse from which items are booked out.

| *Default receiver*
|If you select one of your warehouses as default receiver, this warehouse is preselected when you create a new redistribution as the warehouse in which items are booked in.

|*Filter option "Only display active items" is preselected in item search*
|Activate this option for it to be preselected in the item search of the redistribution. It means that only xref:item:checklist-items-visibility.adoc#100[activated items] are displayed in the search results.

|*Display of added items in the shopping cart*
|Select how items are added to the shopping cart. The default setting is *As one order position, quantities of order items are increased*. +
*As separate order positions* = Same items are added separately as well, meaning that each item is displayed in a separate row.  +
*As one order position, quantities of order items are increased* = Same items are added as one order item, only the quantities are adapted.

|====

[#200]
=== Creating order statuses for redistributions
A certain number of statuses are saved in your plentymarkets system by default. Those default order statuses can also be used for redistributions. You can create statuses that are exclusively used for this particular order type. Creating new order statuses is described in detail on the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1200[Managing orders] page of the manual.

[TIP]
.Creating own order statuses for redistributions
====
We recommend creating separate order statuses that you only use for working with redistributions. Assign individual names to the order statuses to distinguish between redistributions and other order types. This is particularly important when automating the redistribution with the help of <<#1300, event procedures>>.
====

[#300]
=== Creating tags for redistributions
Tags are keywords that you create centrally before you can use them in different areas of your plentymarkets system. How to use tags for redistributions and which user rights are required is explained below.

[#500]
=== Setting up a template for the PO delivery note
Working with redistributions requires using the document type *PO delivery note* (PO = Purchase order). This delivery note lists all variations included in a redistribution.  Warehouse staff and logistics partners can use this document to keep track of the variations included when booking the order items in into the receiving warehouse.

[IMPORTANT]
.Document template has to be set up
====
The document template for the document *PO delivery note* has to be set up before creating the document for the first time. As long as the document template has not been set up, no delivery note can be generated for a redistribution.
====

The following instructions describe how to transfer the default document template saved in your plentymarkets system.

[.instruction]
Setting up a template for the PO delivery note:

. Go to the *Setup » Stock » redistribution management » Redistribution » Documents* menu.
. Open the *Transfer* tab.
. Select the language in which the document is to be generated from the drop-down list above the tab title.
. In the *Apply settings from default document template* area, click on *Accept*. +
→ When you confirm the message, the default settings are applied to the document. Note that by doing this, other settings you might already have chosen for the document are overwritten.

If you want to individualise the *PO delivery note*, for example by displaying your company logo or further information, proceed according to the instructions provided on the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#300[order documents] page of the manual.

[#550]
=== Using the messenger

Use the messenger to create messages about your contacts in the back end. These messages are only visible in your plentymarkets back end and cannot be accessed by your contacts.
To use the messenger, click on *Messenger* on the left-hand side of the opened redistribution menu or open the messenger in the lower area of the redistribution menu.

[.instruction]
Proceed as follows to create a new message:

. Open the redistribution.
. On the left side, click on *Messenger*.
. Click on *New message* (material:add[]). +
→ A text editing window opens.
. Select one or more recipients. +
*_Note:_* The ID of the redistribution is already preselected.
. Enter the subject.
. Enter the text. +
→ When double-clicking on the word, some formatting options for this message become visible.
. Optionally, attach a file by clicking on material:attach_file[] (*Add attachments*).
. Click on material:visibility_off[] *WHISPER* to send the message. +
*_Note:_* If you want to bill the message, click before sending on material:more_vert[] and activate (material:toggle_on[role=skyBlue]) the option *Capture minutes*. The button changes from *WHISPER* to *CAPTURE MINUTES*. After clicking on *CAPTURE MINUTES*, you can decide whether the captured minutes are *Free minutes* or *Paid minutes*.

The message is automatically linked to the ID of the redistribution as soon as you have sent the message. After you have completed all related tasks, you can mark the message as done. For further information, refer to the xref:crm:messenger-testphase.adoc#[Messenger (Test phase)] page.

[#600]
== Creating a redistribution
After having carried out the preparatory settings, you can proceed with creating an order of the type redistribution. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Creating a new redistribution:

. Go to *Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order*.
. Click on *Redistribution* in the navigation on the left. +
→ The detail view of the redistribution opens.
. In the *Status* field, select an initial <<#200, status>> that should be assigned to the new redistribution. This status can be changed at a later point in time.
. In the *Sender* field, select the warehouse from which items should be booked out.
. In the *Receiver* field, select the warehouse into which the items should be booked.
. _Optional_: Select one or several Tags to mark the new redistribution.
. _Optional_: Select an owner for the redistribution.

[TIP]
.Selecting an owner
====
If the required owner is missing, check if the user has been activated as an owner. For general information about user accounts, refer to the xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#40[User accounts and access] page of the manual. In addition, check the <<#400, default settings>> for owners described above.

[#1050]
=== Package content list

The package content list is primarily for staff in the warehouses or for fulfilment service provider. It informs about the contents of pallets and packages. Since a redistribution means that stock is moved from one of your warehouses to another, usually warehouse staff is involved in carrying it out. This is way the package content list can also be displayed in a redistribution. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Adding a package content list:

. Go to the *Package content list* area of an opened redistribution.
. Click on *Add* (material:add[]). +
→  You are redirected to the package content list of the redistribution.
. Search for the required variations of the redistribution by using the filters *Barcode*, *Variation-ID* or *Variation number*. You can only add items that are included in the redistribution. +
→ Items are added directly when you search for them and it is displayed how many packages and pallets are created.
. Click on *Close package* or *Close pallet* to close the package or the pallet. +
→ *Note* that you cannot change anything in this pallet or package once you closed it. You would have to open a new one.

When you go back to the redistribution after this, the created package content list is displayed in the corresponding area of the redistribution. In case you want to add further pallets or packages, click on *Edit* (material:edit[]) and you are redirected again to the package content list. If a redistribution is already finished, the package content list cannot be edited anymore. You can find more information about xref:fulfilment:package-content-list-test-phase.adoc#[package content lists] on the corresponding manual page.

[#1100]
=== Finishing a redistribution
As soon as all order items included in the redistribution have been booked in in the receiving warehouse, finish the redistribution in your plentymarkets system. To do so, go to the *Details* area of the redistribution and click on *Finish redistribution*. The current date is set as the finish date and the redistribution cannot be edited any more.
Alternatively, you can manually set a date with the date picker (icon:calendar[]). After selecting a date, click on *Finish redistribution*. The selected date is set as the finish date and the redistribution cannot be edited anymore.

[TIP]
.Unlocking a redistribution
====
In case you finished the redistribution by mistake, click on *Unlock purchase order* (icon:undo[role="orange"]). This way, the redistribution is unlocked and can be edited again.

== Automating redistributions
Use event procedures to automate the separate working steps of a redistribution. One possibility of automating the generation of the *PO delivery note* has already been described in the <<#870, Automatically generating a PO delivery note>> chapter. In the *Setup » Orders » Events* menu, the events, filters and procedures available in the groups named *Purchase order* allow you to automate certain steps of the redistribution. +

For more detailed information on setting up event procedures, refer to the xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[Event procedures] page of the manual. +
If you are working with event procedures for the first time, pay attention to the information provided on creating event procedures in the chapter xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#100[Creating a new event procedure].
