:description: Learn how box picking works in the plentyWarehouse app.

include::partial$note-requirements.adoc[]

Using box picking, your warehouse staff can pick all items that are needed to fulfil an order and deliver them to the packing table, pre-sorted and ready to be shipped.

The plentyWarehouse app offers a new and improved function for box picking. You can find all necessary information on this page of the manual.

[IMPORTANT]
.Use labels for storage locations
====
For mobile box picking with plentyWarehouse, we recommend that you create one label for each storage location and <<#400, box>> and that you attach it to the respective storage location. During box picking, you use your device to scan the barcode on the label to select the appropriate storage locations and box storage locations.
Have you not created labels for storage locations yet? Refer to the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#800[Setting up a warehouse] page of the manual.
====

First, read a <<#100, short description on box picking>> that explains the process. Afterwards, the <<#200, settings>> that you should carry out in advance will be described. These settings go into effect when you <<#800, use the function>>.

.Workflow for box picking
--
Warehouse employees have trolleys that they take through the warehouse. Any number of boxes are available on the trolley. Each box is assigned to an order that needs to be processed.

The warehouse employee takes the trolley through the warehouse and looks at a mobile device that shows which items have to be picked. In this overview, duplicate items are grouped together. For example, if the same item is included in two different orders, then the warehouse employee will see that two copies of the item have to be picked. The warehouse employee picks the item and then places it in the box that represents the respective order. This way, each item is automatically assigned to the correct order while it is picked.

Once all of the boxes are filled with items, the warehouse employee returns to the packing table. The first box is scanned and the corresponding order is loaded. The warehouse employee processes the order as usual. At the end of this process, the box is unlinked from the order. The box is then available again and the warehouse employee can re-use it on the next trip through the warehouse.

[IMPORTANT]
.Carrying out settings for several warehouses
====
First, decide in which warehouses your warehouse staff should be able to use the mobile box picking function. Then, carry out the <<#200, one-time settings>> individually for each desired warehouse.

== Assigning rights for box picking

Before box picking is carried out in plentyWarehouse, make sure that all users without admin accounts have been assigned the appropriate rights. This is necessary to make sure that the picking process is carried out correctly.

:rights-purpose: carry out box picking in plentyWarehouse
:right-one: pass:quotes[*Item > Item > Item image > Item image name > Read*]
:right-two: pass:quotes[*Orders > Read*]
:right-three: pass:quotes[*Orders > Update*]
:right-four: pass:quotes[*Comments > Read*]
:right-five: pass:quotes[*Comments > Create*]

include::_includes:partial$rights.adoc[]

[#155]
== Determining visibility of the function in the plentyWarehouse app

Now, assign rights so that the function for box picking is visible and usable for the respective users of the plentyWarehouse app. If needed, also assign the rights for displaying order information.

:rights-purpose: use the Box picking function in plentyWarehouse

:right-one: pass:quotes[*plentyWarehouse > Box picking > See*]
:right-two: pass:quotes[*plentyWarehouse > Order information > See*]

include::_includes:partial$rights-simple-mode.adoc[]

[#550]
== Assigning rights for order statuses

Typically, the orders that are processed during box picking have specific xref:stock-management:box-picking.adoc#intable-source-status[source statuses] assigned to them. Which statuses are used for this depends on the individual workflow of your company.

To use box picking without any errors and move the orders to the desired xref:stock-management:box-picking.adoc#intable-target-status[target status], you have to assign rights for displaying and editing those exact order statuses in the plentymarkets back end.

[.instruction]
Assigning rights for order statuses:

. Go to *Setup » Account management » Roles » [Select role]*.
. Scroll down to the *Access rights* area.
. Expand the menu entry *Changeable order status* (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]).
. *Activate* (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]) the order statuses that orders for box picking usually have.
. Expand the menu entry *Visible order status* (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]).
. *Activate* (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]) the order statuses that orders for box picking usually have.
. Click on *Save* (material:save[]).

[#200]
== Carrying out settings for box picking

If you are working with the function for box picking for the first time, make sure that the following settings are carried out beforehand. Otherwise, errors will occur during the process.

[#300]
=== Configuring settings in the plentymarkets back end

Before you <<#800, use box picking>>, you need to carry a few settings one time only in your plentymarkets system. For example, these settings specify which boxes are available, which warehouse technicians are in charge of box picking and when the order and box should be unlinked.

[#400]
==== Making boxes available

In the warehouse, every item is stored at its own xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#500[storage location]. When picking an order, the warehouse employee goes and gets the item from its storage location and then places the item in a box. The item stays in that box until the warehouse technician has finished packing and shipping the order.

Thus, boxes are essentially temporary storage locations. Just like regular storage locations, you'll need to create boxes one time in advance. Specifically, you create one storage location for each box. Then you specify that these storage locations should be used for box picking.

[.instruction]
Making boxes available:

. Log into your plentymarkets system.
. Go to *Setup » Stock » Warehouse » [Select a warehouse] » Storage locations*.
. Create new storage locations for box picking. Refer to the chapter on xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#500[creating storage locations].
. Set the storage location’s *Purpose* to *Box*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#600]
==== Modifying the order process

You can integrate box picking with plentyWarehouse into your company’s existing xref:automation:setting-up-processes.adoc#[order process]. To do so, add the following procedure and sub-procedure to your existing process in the plentymarkets back end.

[IMPORTANT]
.Identifying the correct point in time for unlinking boxes from orders
====
Should a box automatically be unlinked from the order as soon as the items are packed after box picking? If yes, proceed as follows.
If the box should only be unlinked from the order after outgoing items have been booked for the order, proceed <<#1500, as described below>>.
====

[.instruction]
Modifying the existing order process:

. Go to *Setup » Processes » [Select process]*.
. Add the procedure and sub-procedure. Carry out the settings according to <<table-procedure-subprocedure-picking>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-procedure-subprocedure-picking]]
.Procedure and sub-procedure for box picking
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Procedure: Order search*
|Add the xref:automation:procedures.adoc#190[*Order search*] procedure to the xref:automation:work-steps.adoc#single-order-processing[Single order processing] work step. This procedure searches for individual orders, with the goal of processing them further afterward. +
Open the procedure’s settings and set the *Mode* to *Box search*. This specifies that your warehouse technician will scan the box - meaning the temporary storage location - and then plentymarkets will load the corresponding order.

| *Sub-procedure: Remove order from box*
|Add the xref:automation:sub-procedures.adoc#195[Remove order from box] sub-procedure to the xref:automation:procedures.adoc#170[Order] procedure. This sub-procedure unlinks the order from the box. This makes the box available again, so that it can be re-used on the next trip through the warehouse.

[#700]
=== Carrying out settings in the plentyWarehouse app

Before you <<#800, use box picking>>, you need to carry a few settings one time only in the plentyWarehouse app. For example, these settings specify how many orders should be picked at once and how the app should react if an error occurs with any of these orders.

include::partial$plentywarehouse-rights-settings.adoc[]

[.instruction]
Configuring the settings:

. xref:stock-management:installation-and-initial-setup.adoc#300[Log into plentyWarehouse].
. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]) in the top left corner.

[#800]
== Using box picking in plentyWarehouse

Once you have carried out the preparatory settings, you can begin using the plentyWarehouse app to pick several orders at once and bring them back to the packing table, pre-sorted and ready to be shipped.

[IMPORTANT]
.Are any orders available?
====
Orders can only be processed using the box picking function in plentyWarehouse if they fit the criteria that you selected in the <<#700, settings>>. This means that orders have to match the selected warehouse and the source status. If no orders fit the criteria, no orders will be available for box picking in plentyWarehouse.
====

[#900]
=== Specifying the number of boxes

First, enter the number of boxes that you want to work with, meaning the number of orders that you want to pick simultaneously.

[.instruction]
Specifying the number of boxes:

. xref:stock-management:installation-and-initial-setup.adoc#300[Log into plentyWarehouse].
. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]) in the top left corner. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Or: Find the *Box picking* tile in the *Functions* area on the dashboard.
. Tap on *Box picking* (image:stock-management:icon_box-picking.png[width=24, height=24]). +
→ The start screen is displayed.
. Tap on the plus or minus icon to increase or decrease the xref:stock-management:box-picking.adoc#intable-default-boxes[previously defined number of boxes].
. Tap *Start* when you're ready to go. +
→ A list of items is created for the corresponding orders. +
→ The status of the corresponding orders is changed to the xref:stock-management:box-picking.adoc#intable-target-status[previously defined target status].

[#1000]
=== Finding the items in the warehouse

plentymarkets automatically creates a list of all the items that are ready to be picked in the warehouse. Duplicate items are grouped together. For example, if the same item is included in two different orders, the warehouse employee will see that two copies of the item have to be picked.

The list includes important information on the items that have to be picked. Warehouse employees do not only see how many copies of an item have to be picked, but are also shown the storage location and name of the item.

Now the warehouse employee takes the trolley and walks over to where the first item is stored. Upon arrival, the warehouse employee scans the barcode of the storage location. Then, the barcode of the first item is scanned. Depending on the setting you have selected for the options xref:stock-management:box-picking.adoc#intable-storage-location-scan[Mandatory scan of storage location] and xref:stock-management:box-picking.adoc#intable-item-scan[Mandatory item scan], you can alternatively tap on storage locations and items in the app to select them manually.

[.instruction]
Working with the item list:

. Take a look at the list to find out where the item is stored.
. Take the trolley to the storage location at which the item is stored.
. Scan the storage location's barcode or tap on the storage location in the app.
. Scan the item's barcode or tap on the item in the app.

[#1100]
=== Linking the order to a box

Which box do you want to temporarily store this item in? Scan an empty box or tap on an empty box in the app. This step automatically links the order to the box.

[IMPORTANT]
.Orders with multiple items
====
Some orders contain more than just one item. If you've already scanned the first item and linked it to a box, then you won't need to link the second item with a new box too. Instead, you'll continue using the box that you've already linked.
====

[#1200]
=== Picking items

plentyWarehouse displays important data on the status of box picking. This way, you can see the number of items that need to be picked as well as the storage locations at which the items can be found.

[.instruction]
Picking items:

. Take a look at the app to access information about the picking process.
. Scan the item or tap plus or minus to specify how many copies of the item you have picked. +
*_Note:_* Every time you scan the item, the number is automatically increased by one.
. Place the item in the corresponding box.
. Scan the box that you have just picked or tap the green check mark to finish the picking process. +
→ plentymarkets links the item to the box. The storage location of the item is changed to this temporary storage location. Your plentymarkets system keeps a record of this xref:stock-management:managing-stocks.adoc#1100[stock movement].
. Repeat steps 1 through 4 for every order that contains the item. +
→ Once picking is finished for this item, the screen changes. You see the <<#1000, list of items>> again and you can begin picking the next item. +
→ Once you have finished picking all items, a final screen is displayed.
. Click on the red check mark to finish box picking.

[#1300]
=== Additional procedures for items

Some particular use cases may occur while you are <<#1200, picking items>>. For example, it might be necessary to move an item to the end of the list because you will only get to the storage location of the item at a later point in the picking process. Maybe an item is not available at the indicated storage location, or you want to create an order note containing a comment on the item.

For such cases, the view on each item contains shortcuts which allow you to quickly take care of these tasks. <<table-box-picking-shortcuts>> contains additional information on the available options.

[[table-box-picking-shortcuts]]

|[#intable-remove-item]*Remove item*
|material:cancel[]
| Removes the item from the item list. Use this function in case the required item is not available at the storage location. Optionally, you can add a comment in this step. The comment will be saved as an order note with each order that contains this item. You can access these order notes in the back end of your plentymarkets system later. In addition, the status of the order will be changed to the error status.

| *Item information*
|material:info[]
| Opens a page with additional information on the item. Depending on the setting you have carried out for the xref:stock-managment:installation-and-initial-setup.adoc#intable-other-settings[Shortcut behaviour] option, you will be asked if you want to automatically return to the item list after viewing the item information.

|====

[#1400]
=== Finishing box picking

As soon as all required <<#1200, items have been picked>> and, if necessary, orders with unavailable items have been xref:stock-management:box-picking.adoc#intable-remove-item[assigned the error status], an end screen is automatically displayed.

This screen contains information on the orders that have been processed during box picking. You can see at a glance

* how many orders have been picked
* how many different items and how many copies of those items have been picked
* how many orders have not been picked completely
* how much time was needed for mobile box picking.

Tap on material:done[] finish box picking.

[#1500]
=== Packing items

Once all of the boxes have been filled with items, the warehouse employee returns to the packing table. The first box is scanned and the corresponding order is loaded. The warehouse employee xref:automation:carrying-out-processes.adoc#[processes the order as usual]. Outgoing items are booked from the temporary storage location, meaning from the box.

You can adjust your company’s existing xref:automation:setting-up-processes.adoc#[order process] so that the link between a box and an order is automatically removed as soon as outgoing items are booked for the order. To do so, add the following procedure and sub-procedure to your existing process in the plentymarkets back end.

[.instruction]
Modifying the existing order process:

. Go to *Setup » Processes » [Select process]*.
. Add the procedure and sub-procedure. Carry out the settings according to <<table-procedure-subprocedure-packing>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-procedure-subprocedure-packing]]

This way, the box is automatically unlinked from the order when outgoing items are booked for the order. This makes the box available again, so that it can be re-used for the next run of box picking.

| *Sub-procedure: Remove order from box*
|Add the xref:automation:sub-procedures.adoc#195[Remove order from box] sub-procedure to the xref:automation:procedures.adoc#170[Order] procedure.
This sub-procedure unlinks the order from the box. This makes the box available again, so that it can be re-used on the next trip through the warehouse.
