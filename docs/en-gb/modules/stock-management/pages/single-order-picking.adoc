**Single order picking** allows you to search for specific individual orders and pick the required items for those orders. As soon as you have used the order search integrated in the function to select an order, a temporary pick list is created for this order. This pick list is then displayed in plentyWarehouse and can be processed immediately. This means that you can pick the items for individual orders as soon as possible, without having to generate a pick list in the plentysystems back end first. As a consequence, your shipping process is much quicker, your entire workflow is simplified and the items are on their way to your customers even sooner!

== Assigning rights for single order picking

Before single order picking is carried out in plentyWarehouse, make sure that all users without roles of the type *Administrator* have been assigned the appropriate rights. Otherwise, single order picking cannot be carried out correctly and the stock changes cannot be saved in the plentysystems back end.

== Assigning rights for order statuses

Typically, orders that should be processed using single order picking are in specific xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1200[order statuses]. Which statuses are used for this depends on the individual workflow of your company.

To carry out single order picking without errors, you have to assign rights for displaying and editing those exact order statuses in the plentysystems back end.

[.instruction]
Assigning rights for order statuses:

. Go to *Setup » Account management » Roles » [Select role]*.
. Scroll down to the *Access rights* area.
. Expand the menu entry *Changeable order status* (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]).
. *Activate* (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]) the order statuses that orders usually have.
. Expand the menu entry *Visible order status* (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]).
. *Activate* (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]) the order statuses that orders usually have.
. Click on *Save* (material:save[]).

As soon as you have selected an order, a list of items that have to be picked is displayed in the *Open* tab. Proceed by fetching the items from the storage locations one after the other. Items that have already been picked can be viewed by tapping on the *Picked* tab.

For each item, the storage location at which it can be found as well as the required quantity and additional item information are displayed.

[TIP]
.Visibility of item images in plentyWarehouse
====
Are the item images that you have saved in your system not displayed in the item list? In this case, make sure that you have xref:item:import-export-create-directory.adoc#94[linked the images to the appropriate variations] in the plentysystems back end.
====

Depending on the setting you have carried out for the option xref:stock-management:single-order-picking.adoc#intable-itemscan[Mandatory item scan], you can scan the items one after another or enter the quantity via the quantity field.

[IMPORTANT]
.Internet connection required
====
In general, you can pick items even if you don’t have an active internet connection so that short connection interruptions are not an issue. However, there is one exception: Make sure that your device is connected to the internet before you finish the pick list. If there is no internet connection, the pick list cannot be finished properly, which causes subsequent errors.

[#330]
