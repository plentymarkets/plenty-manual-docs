The backlog lists show you variations that have been reordered but have not been booked in yet. In other words, variations that are undelivered. Furthermore, you will learn where you can see variations that are returned and should be on the way back to you.

== Searching for undelivered variations

You can perform a general search for undelivered variations or you can search for variations that have been reordered specifically for a customer's order. Each search has its own menu.

[#200]
=== General search

Variations that have been <<stock-management/managing-reorders/working-with-reorders#, reordered>>, but have not been booked in yet, are listed in the *Stock » Reorder management » Backlog list* menu. A search will not automatically be carried out when you open the menu. The default search is not limited by any filters. This means the default search will search for all undelivered variations from all warehouses and suppliers and regardless of how old the reorder is. Use filters to limit the search results.

The backlog list search results will be listed by item ID in ascending order of the IDs. You can open the item, the reorder or the customer by clicking on the ID. The IDs are displayed along with the result. <<Table-search-result-column>> provides you with explanations of the information displayed in the search results.

[TIP]

== List supply that is coming in from returns

You have a separate menu that lists the items that are announced to be returned. A search will automatically be carried out when you open the *Stock » Returns » Supply* menu. The results are listed in descending order according to the date that the return was created. Items from the latest return are listed first.
