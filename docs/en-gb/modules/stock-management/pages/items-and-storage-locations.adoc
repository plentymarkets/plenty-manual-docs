plentyWarehouse makes it easy for you to keep an eye on the items, stock and storage locations of your plentymarkets system at any time.
The <<#100, *Item search*>> and <<#400, *Inspect storage location*>> functions are available for this purpose. This manual page offers you information on their scope and on how to use them.

[#100]
== Item search

Do you want to look for items, display stock or view detailed information on items and variations while on the go or directly at your warehouse? The item search lets you do just that. <<#200, First, carry out a few settings>> to determine what the search results should look like. These settings will go into effect when you use plentyWarehouse to <<#300, search for items>> later. In addition, you can use <<#350, multiple shortcuts>> to quickly carry out additional procedures for items.

[#200]
=== Carrying out settings for the item search

With the help of a few basic settings, you can customise the item search in plentyWarehouse so that it fits your needs and workflows.

For example, you can determine how many search results are displayed at once or which search fields should be available in which order.
