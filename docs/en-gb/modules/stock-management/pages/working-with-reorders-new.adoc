:description: Learn how to work with reorders, use group functions and carry out the settings in the different areas of a reorder.


Reorders allow you to efficiently map out merchandise orders with your suppliers. In the reorder overview, you can see important information at a glance and perform some actions directly. This simplifies the entire reordering process and helps you manage your inventory optimally at all times.

[#100]
== Using group functions

Use the group functions to perform actions simultaneously for multiple reorders. The group functions in the table below are available for reorders. +
*_Note_*: You can licking on *Select all* (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]) at the top left to select all reorders on the current page and perform an action.

[.instruction]
Using group functions:

. Go to *Stock » Reorder (Test phase)*.
. Carry out the Search (material:search[]) to display reorders.
. Select (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]) all reorders for which you want to carry out a certain action at once.
. Select one of the available group functions. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-reorder-group-functions>>.

[TIP]
.Select default group functions
In the editing mode (terra:design_inline_edit[role="darkGrey"]) of the reorder overview, you can determine *default group functions* that become directly visible when selecting reorders. All remaining group functions will automatically be added to the context menu (material:more_vert[]).
