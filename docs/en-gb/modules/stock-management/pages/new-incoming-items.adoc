:description: You've just received goods from your supplier. What now? This page teaches you how to book the stock into plentymarkets.
:author: team-stock

There are several ways to book stock into your system.
First of all, you need to have a warehouse, a storage location and a supplier assigned to a variation.

This page teaches you how to book in stock via the *Stock » New incoming items* menu.
Your system will only be able to automatically xref:item:managing-items.adoc#200[adjust the display of variations in your online store] and to start listings, if you book variations in and out and manage your stock correctly in plentymarkets.

[#250]
== Identifying the purchase price

The range of settings that are connected to the purchase price is versatile. 2 different purchase prices can be shown in the variation's data record. One purchase price is always the moving average price. The second purchase price that will be displayed depends on your settings. You can either enter a purchase price or you can transfer a purchase price from the latest incoming items data record. Moreover, you also have the possibility to transfer a second average purchase price. This second average purchase price is a sort of live average purchase price. All different purchase price options that can be transferred are described in the <<#300, Transferring storage location and purchase price>> chapter. +
How the two different average purchase prices are calculated is described in the following table.

[[table-average-purchase-price-calculation]]
.Formulas average purchase price
[cols="1a,1a"]
|====
|Live average calculation |Moving average calculation

|latexmath:[LAPP_{new} = {LAAP_{old} \cdot Quantity_{old} + PurchasePrice_{new} \cdot Quantity_{new}\over Quantity_{old} + Quantity_{new}}] +
 +
LAPP~new~ = New live average purchase price +
LAPP~old~ = Old live average purchase price +
Quantity~old~ = Previous stock quantity +
PurchasePrice~new~ = Purchase price of incoming items +
Quantity~new~ = Quantity of incoming items
|latexmath:[MAAP_{new} = {MAAP_{old} \cdot Quantity_{old} + PurchasePrice_{new} \cdot Quantity_{new}\over Quantity_{old} + Quantity_{new}}] +
 +
MAAP~new~ = New moving average purchase price +
MAAP~old~ = Old moving average purchase price +
Quantity~old~ = Previous stock quantity +
PurchasePrice~new~ = Purchase price of incoming items +
Quantity~new~ = Quantity of incoming items

a|A recalculation is carried out in the following cases:

* Incoming items
* Outgoing items

The current average is given in export formats or used for statistics. If you want to see this purchase price in a variation's data record, you need to select that the average purchase price is transferred to variations. +
In order to see the price on the variation, open the *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items* menu, go to the *purchase price* setting and select the option *Save live average purchase price in the variation data*. The other options are explained in <<table-transfer-purchase-price-storage-location>>.

a|A recalculation is carried out in the following cases:

* Incoming items

However, a recalculation will only be carried out if you defined that stock booked into this warehouse is used for the calculation of the moving average purchase price. Each variation has a separate field for showing the moving average price. +
Go to *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items* to activate the warehouses that should be used for calculating the *moving average purchase price*.

|====

[#300]
== Transferring the storage location and the purchase price

When adding items, you can enter the purchase price, the recommended retail price and the storage location. The RRP will be applied to the variation data record once the incoming items data record is approved. When you add the same variation several times but with different RRPs, the highest RRP will be saved in the variation data, once the incoming items data record is approved. You can specify whether or not the purchase prices of incoming items are saved with the item. If you wish to transfer the purchase price you have several options to select from. In addition, you can also select whether or not a specified storage location for incoming items is saved in the variation data.

[.instruction]
Choosing a transfer option:

. Go to *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items*.
. Select a setting. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-transfer-purchase-price-storage-location>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Purchase price*
|Choose whether the purchase price should be transferred from the incoming items data record and if so, select where the purchase price should be saved. The storage location will be saved once the incoming items data record was approved. +
*Do not transfer the purchase price* = The purchase price will not be transferred. Select this setting if you prefer to manually add and maintain the purchase price in the variation's data. +
*Save purchase price in variation data* = The purchase price will automatically be saved in the *Settings* tab of a variation. In case you book the same variation with different purchase prices in one incoming items data record, the purchase price that is listed last in this data record will be transferred. +
*Save purchase price in variation and supplier data* = The purchase price will automatically be saved in the *Settings* tab of a variation as well as in the *Stock* tab of a supplier. In case you book the same variation with different purchase prices in one incoming items data record, the purchase price that is listed last in this data record will be transferred. +
*Save live average purchase price in the variation data* = The average purchase price will be recalculated every time new incoming items are received or items are booked out. The actual purchase prices of those variations currently available in the warehouse are used for this calculation. The average purchase price will automatically be saved in the *Settings* tab of a variation. <<table-average-purchase-price-calculation>> shows the formula used in the calculation. +
*Save the highest purchase price* = If several different purchase prices are available, the highest purchase price of the current incoming items data record will be saved with the variation data. +
*Save the lowest purchase price* = If several different purchase prices are available, the lowest purchase price of the current incoming items data record will be saved with the variation data.

| *Storage location*
| Choose whether the storage location should be transferred and if so, select where it should be saved. The storage location will be saved once the incoming items data record was approved. +
*Do not save the storage location* = The storage location will not be saved. +
*Save storage location in variation data* = The storage location is automatically saved as suggested storage location in the *Warehouse* tab of a variation. The storage location will be newly transferred with each new incoming items data record that the variation is included in. +
*Save the storage location for items and variations if no storage location was saved yet* = The transfer is only carried out t if no storage location was saved yet.

== Assigning the RRP to a price

To enter an RRP while booking stock in, you need to define which sales price should be used as RRP. Furthermore, you can select the sales price that will be displayed when booking incoming items.

[.instruction]
Assigning the RRP to a price:

. Go to *Setup » Stock » New incoming items*.
. Select one of your sales prices from the drop-down list for the *RRP*.
. Select one of your sales prices from the drop-down list for the *price*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

However, it is not sufficient to assign a price in the *Setup » Stock » New incoming items* menu in order to display a sales price in a variation. You also need to assign the sales price to a variation. To create a sales price, go *Setup » Item » Sales prices*. For further information about sales prices, refer to the xref:item:prices.adoc#200[Sales prices and price calculation] page. On this page, you will also learn how to calculate prices for customer classes.

[#450]
== Booking in stock via the plentymarkets back end

There are several ways to book incoming items, e.g. by using the plentymarkets app, via the data import, or via the *New incoming items* menu. This menu offers you the most extensive options because in addition to booking in stock, you can also specify other data such as procurement costs.

=== Recording incoming items

The recording of incoming items is carried out in 2 steps. At first you need to enter general information such as the supplier and the currency. In the second step the variations and the delivered quantities are registered.

==== Registering general incoming items information

You need to have at least one warehouse and supplier before you can register incoming items.
Create a xref:crm:create-contact.adoc#create-contact[customer data record] for each supplier and select the customer type Supplier.
Furthermore, at least one user has to be activated as xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#40[owner of incoming items] so that the incoming items can be assigned to an owner.
It is not possible to record incoming items without an owner.
The owners are sorted by ID.
If the user who is currently logged in was also activated as an owner, this user will be selected by default.

[.instruction]

→ The incoming items data record opens in a new tab. It will have an ID and will be given the status *Created*. Click on the small plus on the left side of the header to see additional information about the incoming items data record.

If you pay for the incoming items in a currency other than your xref:payment:currencies.adoc#30[standard currency], the xref:payment:currencies.adoc#20[exchange rate] will be entered automatically.

Finalise the incoming items data record by adding items and procurement costs.

[#600]
==== Adding items to the incoming items data record

You can add variations individually or several at once. However, it is only possible to add variations that already exist as data records in your system. Whenever a new item is delivered, first create a new xref:item:new-item.adoc#[item] and the corresponding variations.
When you first open the list of items and variations, all variations from all suppliers are listed. Use the search to display items of a particular supplier. +
If you entered a purchase price for a variation, it will automatically be displayed here and can be used. Click on the item ID to open and edit the item data record. Proceed as described below to add the delivered items to the incoming items data record.

[[table-statuses-incoming-items]]
.Available statuses
[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Status |Explanation

| *Created*
|Incoming items data records automatically receive this status when they are created.

| *In review*
|It makes sense to select this status once all of the delivered items have been recorded and the data record in plentymarkets is checked for accuracy against the delivery note.

| *Error*
|For incoming items data records that contain an error.

| *Cancelled*
|Indicates that the data record should no longer be used. It is not possible to delete incoming items data records. Therefore, it makes sense to use this status for faulty data records.

| *Approved*
|Adds the incoming items to the stock. In other words, this status makes the new incoming items available for outstanding orders, new listings, etc. The incoming items data record is locked and can no longer be edited.

| *Correction*
|Unlocks certain entries such as the supplier, the delivery note number etc. for editing. However, the purchase price remains locked and cannot be edited.
|====

[#1100]
=== Adding stock to a variation

Approve the incoming items data record to actually add the stock to a variation and to apply the RRP from the incoming items data record to the variation data. If there are several different RRPs for the same variation, the highest RRP will be applied to the variation data. +
As soon as an incoming items data record is switched to the status *Approved*, it is no longer possible to change a variation or add further variations. Other data such as the supplier also remain locked when the incoming items data record has the status *Approved*.

You can see a variation's stock under tab *Stock* » tab *Stock*. The tab *Item movement* lists all of the item movements, so you can for example also see when the purchase price in the incoming items data record was changed. All changes that are made to the item quantity or purchase price are recorded as item movements. The changes are recorded regardless of which status the incoming items data record has.

Open the menu xref:stock-management:managing-stocks.adoc#[Stock » Stocks] to see the stock of all items and variations.

[#1200]

=== Changing and correcting an incoming items data record

Incoming items data records can only be changed if they have a certain status. Incoming items data records can be changed if they have the status *Created*, *In review*, *Error* or *Cancelled*. Information such as the supplier, the delivery note number and the quantity can be edited. Whenever changing sensitive data such as the purchase price or the item quantity, a note is automatically created. The user who made this change is automatically saved as the author of the note. It is not possible to change data records that have already been approved. When using the status *Correction*, the quantity and basic information such as the warehouse become editable again.

[#1400]

[#1600]
== Searching for an incoming items data record

There are two menus where you can search for incoming items data records: *Stock » Incoming items* and *Stock » New incoming items*. In the *Stock » Incoming items* menu, all incoming items data records are listed regardless of whether they were created in the app, via the import tool or in the *New incoming items* menu. In the *New incoming items* menu, you can only find incoming items data records that were booked in via this menu.

[#1700]
=== Searching in the new incoming items menu

Use the search function in the incoming items menu to find specific data records. Many of the search filters refer to items or variations. Thus, you can use the filters to search for incoming items data records that include items or variations with this ID, number or flag. When you open the menu, the last 2 months are automatically selected as delivery period. If you want to find an incoming items data record that is older, you need to reset the filters first.

[.instruction]
Searching in the new incoming items menu:

. Go to *Stock » New incoming items*.
. Select the desired search settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-incoming-items-search-app>>.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The incoming items data records that match the search criteria are displayed.

=== Searching for incoming items in the *Stock » incoming items* menu

There are many ways to book stock into your system. You can do this via Rest, via the import tool, in the item data or via the *New incoming items* menu. However, no matter how the stock was booked into your system, all incoming items data records are listed in the *Stock » Incoming items* menu. The search is carried out by month.

[.instruction]
Searching for an incoming items data record:

. Got to *Stock » Incoming items*.
. Select the desired filters. The current month is preset. +
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The incoming items data records that match the search criteria are displayed.

[IMPORTANT]
.Identifying archive entries
====
An entry will be archived after 3 months, but only if all stock that was booked in with this entry has either been booked out or has been redistributed in the meanwhile. Once an incoming items data record has been archived you will see an archive symbol in the *Archive* column.
Archive data cannot be edited or deleted.
====

In this menu you can also do the following:

*  You can export incoming items data records by month
*  You can open, edit and individually export incoming items data records

In the *Base* tab, you can edit the *Supplier*, the *Delivery date* and the *Delivery note number*. In the *Item* tab, you can adjust the *Purchase price*.

[#1900]
== Deleting empty storage locations

In the *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items* menu, it is possible to determine a period of time after which empty storage locations are deleted. When activating the option *Delete empty storage location after*, the entry is removed from the table after expiration of the determined period and the linkage to the individual items is deleted. In the system, it is no longer considered that the item has ever existed on the storage location. +
*_Note:_* This does not apply to the standard storage location (ID 0) of the main warehouse on the item or on the variation; this one is always visible.

[#2000]
== Hiding stock entries of 0

In the *Stock » Stock » Incoming items* menu, it is possible to determine a period of time after which stock entries of 0 are hidden. In case an item is stored in a second warehouse, the stock is set to zero. By activating the option *Hide stock entry of “0” after*, the entry in the variation's stock overview disappears after the determined period, but remains saved in the background. Thus, reversals or incoming items that have the setting *Used storage location* can still use and display this storage location. +
*_Note:_* This does not apply to the standard storage location (ID 0) of the main warehouse on the item or on the variation; this one is always visible.
