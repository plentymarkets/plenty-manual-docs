Do you want to take inventory and get an overview of your stock at a certain point in time? Then this page is for you. Learn which steps are necessary to take stock and how to adjust the process to your needs.

[#100]
== Preparations

In the following, you will find information on the preparations we recommend you to carry out to make stocktaking as easy as possible.

[#150]
=== Downloading the plentyWarehouse app

The easiest way to take stock is by using the xref:stock-management:plentywarehouse.adoc#[plentyWarehouse app]. plentyWarehouse offers a newly developed stocktaking function. With the latest version, plentyWarehouse also allows you to export xref:stock-management:carrying-out-stocktaking.adoc#600[legally compliant inventory log exports] in different file formats after you have completed the stocktaking process. In addition, the item and variation quantities that are counted using the plentyWarehouse app are automatically synchronised with your system.

Download the plentyWarehouse app free of charge link:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plentysystems.plentywarehouse&hl=en[here on Google Play Store^] {nbsp}icon:external-link[].

Are you working with the plentyWarehouse app for the first time? Then take a look at the information provided on our xref:stock-management:plentywarehouse.adoc#[overview page].

[#200]
=== Settings for stocktaking with the plentyWarehouse app

To make sure that the stocktaking process works exactly as needed for your workflow, some preparatory settings have to be carried out in the *Settings* area of the plentyWarehouse app. For details and instructions on this step, refer to the xref:stock-management:carrying-out-stocktaking.adoc#200[Taking stock] manual page.

[#300]
=== Creating exports via catalogue

To take stock and document as well as check the results later, you should export both the current stocks and stock movements of your system before starting the stocktaking process.

* For general information on how to create a catalogue for exporting data, refer to the xref:data:file-export.adoc#[Using standard formats] manual page.
* To learn how to create an export containing stocks with catalogues, refer to the manual page covering the xref:data:catalogues-stocks.adoc#[Stocks] format.
* To learn how to create an export containing stock movements with catalogues, refer to the manual page covering the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc[Stock movements] format.

[#400]
=== Clearing stocks via import

In this chapter, we explain how you can set your stocks to zero using the import. +

*_Note:_* This step is only necessary if you are using the stocktaking mode and you want to clear your stocks.

[#500]
=== Should you set the stocks to zero or not?

Before starting the stocktaking process, you should decide if you want to set all stocks to zero or not. First, we will show you what you should pay attention to if using this method.

* As long as the stocktaking mode is active, any stock movements occurring in the meantime will be registered, but no calculations will be carried out.
* Once you deactivate the stocktaking mode, the paused calculations are carried out once again.
* The availability of your items on markets and in your online shop will not be affected if you set stocks to zero while the stocktaking mode is active. However, if items are sold during the stocktaking process, the reserved stock will not be calculated. Some items may be oversold in this case.
* If the stocktaking mode is not activated, the calculations run as normal in case stock changes occur. When counting stocks for storage locations with the app, the stocks are transmitted to the system after the counting is finished and adjusted. If the counted quantity of an item on a storage location equals the quantity that has been available before stocktaking, no stock movement is created.

Make sure which methods suits you and your workflow best. +
The following table summarises all advantages and disadvantages of clearing stocks once again.

[[table-clearing-stocks]]
.Advantages and disadvantages of clearing stocks
[cols="2,2"]
|====
|Advantages |Disadvantages

|On the date of stocktaking, all variations on your warehouse have a stock of zero. This means that all quantities that are counted during stocktaking will lead to a positive stock movement being created. +
_Example:_ Variation 123 +
- Quantity before stocktaking: 8 +
- Quantity due to clearing stock: 0 +
- Stock movement: -8 +
- Quantity after counting: 8 +
- Stock movement: +8
|Remember to activate the stocktaking mode before starting the stocktaking process and to deactivate it after you are finished taking stock.

|A stock movement will be created for all items that are in stock in your warehouse.
|Stocks have to be cleared after activating the stocktaking mode, e.g. via an import.

|
|During stocktaking mode, overselling may occur.

|
|In case anything goes wrong during stocktaking, you might have to import the stocks that existed before stocktaking once again.

|
|Before deactivating the stocktaking mode, all storage locations have to be counted completely.

[#600]
=== Exporting data

To record the item quantities that are in stock before the stocktaking process is started, you should carry out an export. To do so, use the xref:data:file-export.adoc#[catalogue] and the export format xref:data:catalogues-stocks.adoc#[Stocks].
After the export, download the file and save it on your computer so that you can access it later and use it to document your processes.

[#700]
== Taking stock

Depending on if you are activating the xref:stock-management:taking-stock.adoc#500[stocktaking mode] before starting the stocktaking process, you should always follow the steps described below when taking stock.

[#1000]
== Documenting stocktaking

After you have finished taking stock, you can document the stocktaking process in a legally compliant way. For this purpose, the *Inventory log export* menu is available in the *Stock » Stocktaking* area. Here, you can use different filters to download inventory log exports in PDF or CSV format.

[IMPORTANT]
.Limitations for inventory log exports
====
At the moment, inventory log exports only contain data on stocktaking processes that were carried out with the xref:stock-management:plentywarehouse.adoc#[plentyWarehouse app]. For this reason, stocktaking processes that were carried out with the xref:app:stocktaking.adoc#[plentysystems app] or only by xref:stock-management:taking-stock.adoc#100[exporting and importing stocks] cannot be documented using the inventory log export.
====

For important additional information on the possible filters and an instruction on how to create the inventory log export, refer to the xref:stock-management:carrying-out-stocktaking.adoc#600[Taking stock] manual page.

[#1100]
== Export and compare stock differences via catalogue

The following 3 possibilities are available for checking the stocktaking process afterwards, for example if there are considerable differences between the stocks registered before and after stocktaking.

[#1200]
=== Comparing the stocks before and after stocktaking

With this method, you compare both files containing the stocks that you have created before and after the stocktaking process. By comparing the stocks for each variation, you can calculate where differences occur and then check them again and adjust them, if needed. Since you only see the stock quantities here, you might have to check the storage location of the items in your system.

[#1300]
=== Comparing the total differences per variation

Create an export using the catalogue format xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#[Stock movements] and filter by the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#30[date range] and the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#30[reason] for the stock movement (ID 302). This way, only the stock movements that were triggered during and by taking stock are exported. If you also use the filter for the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#30[sum of stock movements] per variation, the export will only contain a single data row for each variation.
However, this is only the case if there is a stock difference for the specific variation before and after stocktaking. If the stock quantities are identical on all storage locations, no data row will be included in the export. If the quantities differ per storage location but the total stock quantity of this variation remains the same, the export will contain a data row with the quantity 0 in the *Stock movement* field.

Thus, this kind of export allows you to quickly see the items with stock differences regarding the total quantity per variation.
For more details, refer to the xref:stock-management:practical-guide-stocktaking.adoc#1500[Identifying and analysing stock differences] chapter.

[#1400]
=== Comparing the differences of a variation per storage location

Create an export using the catalogue format xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#[Stock movements], but without the filter for the sum of stock movements. You only need to filter for the date range and the stock movement reason (ID 302). With this method, you will get a data row if the stock of a variation on a specific storage location differs before and after stocktaking. This list is helpful if the list containing all stock differences showed that you have to check some variations in more detail. Check each storage location for which differences regarding the variation have occurred to see the exact storage location you should check again.
For more details, refer to the xref:stock-management:practical-guide-stocktaking.adoc#1500[Identifying and analysing stock differences] chapter below.

[#1500]
== Identifying and analysing stock differences

The catalogue format xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#[Stock movements] makes evaluating the stocktaking results easier. A catalogue with this format enables you to identify differences between the counted quantities of a variation and the previously registered quantity of the variation in the system. +
Note the following criteria to identify stock differences after stocktaking has been completed.

[#1600]
=== Criterion 1: Are the stocks of a variation identical before and after stocktaking?

To check if the stocks of an item are identical before and after stocktaking, create a catalogue using the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#[Stock movements] format. This way, you export all stock movements (grouped by variation) that occurred during the stocktaking process and that have the stock movement reason *Correction because of stocktaking*.

Within the catalogue, use the filter for the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#30[sum of stock movements] to group the entries for a variation. Use an additional filter to select the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#30[date range] in which the stocktaking process took place.
To only export stock movements that are related to stocktaking, add the filter for the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#30[reason] *Correction because of stocktaking* with the ID `302`.
The resulting export will include the total stock difference per variation. The difference should always be 0. +
Thus, the list shows you at a glance which items have stock differences before and after stocktaking.

*_Note:_* This list does not show if 5 additional copies of an item were counted on one storage location, while 3 copies of the same item could not be counted on another storage location. The sum is always 0. Thus, the list is useful to get a general overview of the stock differences, but does not include information on stock differences per storage location.

[#1700]
=== Criterion 2: Are the items found in identical storage locations before and after stocktaking?

Over time, it can happen that items have been transferred to another storage location, but no corresponding redistribution has been carried out in the system. +
To see stock differences for variations on individual storage locations, create a catalogue using the format xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#[Stock movements]. This way, you export all stock movements that occurred during the stocktaking process and that have the stock movement reason *Correction because of stocktaking*.

Use the filter for the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#30[date range] in which the stocktaking process took place. To only export stock movements that are related to stocktaking, add the filter for the xref:data:catalogues-stock-movements.adoc#30[reason] *Correction because of stocktaking* with the ID `302`.
As a result, the list will include an entry for each stock movement, i.e. for every variation that has a stock difference before and after stocktaking. +
*_Example:_* In the system, the variation with the ID 123 was booked 10 times on storage location A. However, during stocktaking, the variation was counted 10 times on storage location B. In this case, there is a stock movement for this variation of -10 for storage location a and a stock movement of +10 for storage location B. Consequently, the total quantity for this variation is identical before and after stocktaking, but the variation is on a different storage location than before.

Thus, the list allows you to identify and analyse the differences per storage location. In addition, it’s easy for you to keep an overview on how many items may have been transferred to other storage locations without being properly redistributed in the system.
