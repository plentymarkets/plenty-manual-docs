In addition to redistributing items in the xref:stock-management:working-with-redistributions.adoc#[plentymarkets back end], you can also do so with the plentyWarehouse app. plentyWarehouse allows you to register items on your mobile device directly in your warehouse. You can also select source and target storage locations and thus redistribute items quickly and easily.

[#150]
== Assigning rights for the redistribution

Before items are redistributed in plentyWarehouse, make sure that all users without admin accounts have been assigned the appropriate rights. Otherwise, the redistribution cannot be carried out correctly and the stock changes cannot be saved in the plentymarkets back end.

:rights-purpose: redistribute items in plentyWarehouse
:right-one: pass:quotes[*Items > Item > Variation > Warehouse data > Read*]
:right-two: pass:quotes[*Stock > Warehouses > Warehouse location > Read*]
:right-three: pass:quotes[*Setup > Tag > Tag > Read*]

[#155]
== Determining visibility of the function in the plentyWarehouse app

Now, assign rights so that the function for redistributing items is visible and usable for the respective users of the plentyWarehouse app.

:rights-purpose: use the *Redistribution* function in plentyWarehouse

:right-one: pass:quotes[*plentyWarehouse > Redistribution*]

== Carrying out settings for the redistribution

With the help of a few basic settings, you can customise the redistribution function in plentyWarehouse so that it fits your needs and workflows.

include::partial$plentywarehouse-rights-settings.adoc[]

For example, you can determine how many storage locations should be suggested for the redistribution at once or which search fields should be available in which order.

[.instruction]
Carrying out settings for the redistribution:

. xref:stock-management:installation-and-initial-setup.adoc#300[Log into plentyWarehouse].
. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]) in the top left corner.
. Tap on *Settings* (material:settings[]). +
→ The settings menu opens.
. Tap on *Redistribution* (material:sync_alt[]).
. Carry out the settings for the redistribution. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-pw-redistribution-settings>>.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

2+^| *General settings* area

| *Suggest total quantity*
|Select if the total quantity of the variation should be suggested for the redistribution. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = The total quantity of the variations available at the storage location is automatically inserted. +
*Deactivated* (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) = No quantity will be suggested. You will have to enter the quantity manually. +

| *Fast rebooking*
|Activate the option to skip selecting a source storage location. This accelerates the redistribution process. +
*_Note:_* Only activate the option if only one possible source storage location exists in your warehouse.

| *Number of items to scan individually*
|If you are registering items via scanning them, you can use this setting to determine how many variations you have to scan individually until the available total quantity is inserted automatically in the field for entering the quantity. +
*_Example:_* If you enter the number *5* in the quantity field, the total quantity is inserted automatically after you have scanned the variation five times.

| *Show net stock*
|Activate this option to display the respective xref:glossary:glossary.adoc#net-stock[net stock] of each item when redistributing items.

2+^| *Item search* area

| *Item search fields*
|Use the toggle buttons to determine which criteria can be used for the item search while using the redistribution function. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = You will be able to use this criterion when searching for items. +
*_Tip:_* Tap on and hold (material:drag_handle[]) for each activated search criterion and drag it to the desired position to determine the order of the search fields.

| *Focus on item search field*
|Tap on the search field to which the cursor jumps automatically when the menu is opened. If no search field is selected, you have to tap on a search field every time before you can enter a search value.

2+^| *Storage location* area

| *Storage location search fields*
|Use the toggle buttons to determine which criteria can be used for the storage location search while using the redistribution function. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = You will be able to use this criterion when searching for storage locations. +
*_Tip:_* Tap on and hold (material:drag_handle[]) for each activated search criterion and drag it to the desired position to determine the order of the search fields.

| *Focus on storage location search field*
|Will you typically select the source storage location by scanning its barcode or by selecting the storage location from a list? If you want to scan the barcode, then this setting can speed up the job. +
*None* = There will be no focus on any field. Of course, you can still place the cursor in another search field manually. +
*Barcode* = The cursor will automatically start out in the barcode field when you reshelve items. You can scan the source storage location right away. +
*Storage location* = The cursor is automatically placed in the storage location name field.

| *Suggested storage location list*
|Select the storage locations that are suggested as target storage locations. +
*_Tip:_* Tap on (material:drag_handle[]) for each activated search criterion and drag it to the desired position to determine the order in which the suggested storage locations should be displayed. +
*Suggested storage location* = Displays the storage location suggestions linked to the variation. +
*Used storage locations* = Displays the storage locations in which the variation is already stored. +
*Empty storage locations* = Displays all available empty storage locations. +
*_Note:_* Depending on the number of storage locations, the setting *Empty storage locations* can significantly slow down the process of booking in items. Thus, we recommend that you link variations to storage locations and only activate the option *Empty storage locations* in exceptional cases.

| *Mandatory storage location scan*
|Use this option to determine which rules should apply when registering items during the redistribution. +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = All items _must_ be scanned via their label to be registered for the redistribution. It is not possible to select items manually via the search results. +
*Deactivated* (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) = Items can either be registered by scanning them or by selecting them manually.

| *Purpose*
|Use this option to exclude storage locations with specific xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#intable-purpose[purposes] from the list of suggested target storage locations. +
*_Example:_* Deactivate (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) the purpose *Return* to avoid items being redistributed to this storage location by mistake and getting mixed up with returned items.

== Redistributing items

Now, proceed as described below to redistribute items with plentyWarehouse.

[TIP]
.Use labels for storage locations
====
To use the *Redistribution* function most conveniently, create a label for each storage location and place it at the storage location. This way, you can scan the barcode on the label with your device and access the respective storage location for the redistribution easily in plentyWarehouse.
Have you not created labels for storage locations yet? You can find the appropriate instruction on the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#800[Setting up a warehouse] page of the manual.

→ The variations that correspond to the search criteria are displayed.
. Tap on the variation that should be redistributed. +
*_Tip:_* If only one search result is found, the variation is opened automatically. +
. Tap on the storage location of the variation. +
The source storage location of the variation, a quantity field and a list of target storage locations is displayed.
. Edit the quantity of variations that should be redistributed. +
*_Tip:_* If you are using a scanner, scan the item label several times to increase the quantity.
. Tap on the target storage location to which the stock should be redistributed. +
*_Tip:_* If you have labelled your storage locations, scan the storage location label instead. To do so, begin by tapping on the field *Barcode* before using your Bluetooth scanner. +
→ The items are redistributed.
