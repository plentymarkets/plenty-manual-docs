The pick list is an important document for your warehouse staff. It contains all information on which items have to be fetched from which storage locations to process an order.

With plentyWarehouse, your warehouse staff can conveniently find, open and complete pick lists xref:orders:generating-pick-list.adoc#300[created in your system] on mobile devices.

== Assigning rights for pick lists

Before pick lists are processed in plentyWarehouse, make sure that all users without roles of the type *Administrator* have been assigned the appropriate rights. This is necessary for a correct picking process and for finishing the pick lists.

== Carrying out settings for pick lists

Before processing pick lists for the first time in plentyWarehouse, you should carry out some preparatory settings. With these settings, you can adjust the picking process to your needs and workflows.

include::partial$plentywarehouse-rights-settings.adoc[]

For example, you can determine how the items on the pick list should be registered in the warehouse and if you would like to assign a xref:stock-management:mobile-pick-lists.adoc#intable-trolleytag[trolley tag] for processing the pick list.

[.instruction]
Carrying out settings for pick lists:

. xref:stock-management:installation-and-initial-setup.adoc#300[Log into plentyWarehouse].
. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]) in the top left corner.
. Tap on *Settings* (material:settings[]). +
→ The settings menu opens.
. Tap on *Pick lists* (image:stock-management:icon_pick-lists.png[width=24, height=24]).
. Carry out the settings for pick lists. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-pw-pick-lists-settings>>.

|Setting |Explanation

2+^| *General settings* area

| *Pick list sorting*
|In which order should pick lists be displayed when you open the function in plentyWarehouse? Select one of the following two options. +
*Date ascending* = Pick lists will be sorted in ascending order of the date at which they have been created. Thus, the list starts with the oldest pick list. +
*Date descending* = Pick lists will be sorted in descending order of the date at which they have been created. Thus, the list starts with the newest pick list.

| [#intable-trolleytag]*Enable entering a trolley tag*
|Activate this option to display a field for entering a trolley tag when opening a pick list. This makes sense if you want to determine a specific trolley as a container for the items included in the pick list. Make sure to put an identical tag on the trolley so that the trolley can be correctly assigned to the pick list. For more information, refer to the chapter <<#330, Using trolley tags>>.

2+^| *Item registration* area

|[#intable-itemscan]*Mandatory item scan*
|Use this option to determine which rules should apply when registering items included in the pick list. +
*No limitations* = Items can either be registered by scanning their barcode or by selecting them manually. +
*Limit item search* = Items without barcodes can be registered via the item search. Items with barcodes _must_ be registered by scanning the barcode on the item label. +
*Mandatory item scan* = All items _must_ be registered by scanning the barcode on the item label. It is not possible to select items manually via the search results.

| *Number of items to scan individually*
|If you are registering items via scanning them, you can use this setting to determine how many variations you have to scan individually until the available total quantity is inserted automatically in the field for entering the quantity. +
*_Example:_* If you enter the number *5* in the quantity field, the total quantity is inserted automatically after you have scanned the variation five times.

== Processing pick lists

After you have carried out the preparatory settings for pick lists and assigned the necessary user rights, you can start picking items.

First, make sure that all required pick lists have already been created in the *Orders » Fulfilment* menu in the back end of your system. Fur further information, refer to the xref:orders:generating-pick-list.adoc#[Pick lists] page of the manual.

The pick lists created there are automatically synchronised with plentyWarehouse. Thus, you can search for pick lists and open them any time in the app.

[#310]
=== Opening a pick list

Start by opening the pick list that you want to process. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Opening a pick list:

. xref:stock-management:installation-and-initial-setup.adoc#300[Log into plentyWarehouse].
. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]) in the top left corner. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Find the *Pick lists* tile in the *Functions* area on the dashboard.
. Tap on *Pick lists* (image:stock-management:icon_pick-lists.png[width=24, height=24]). +
→ All available pick lists are displayed automatically.
. Tap on material:filter_list[] at the top right to filter pick lists by their status. You can select if you want to filter for pick lists that are *open*, *in progress* or *finished*.
. Tap on *Search* (icon:search[role="darkGrey"]). +
→ The filtered search results are displayed.
. Tap on an entry in the list to open the respective pick list. +
*_Note:_* Pick lists with the status *finished* cannot be reopened. If you select a pick list that is *in progress*, you are asked if you want to continue processing a pick list or reset it. +
→ The pick list is opened.

[TIP]
.Opening a pick list via scan
====
In addition to the method described above, you can tap on the barcode symbol (icon:barcode[role=darkGrey]) at the top of the screen. Then, scan the barcode of a printed-out pick list to open the pick list in plentyWarehouse.

[#320]
=== Picking items

As soon as you have opened a pick list, a list of items that have to be picked is displayed in the *Open* tab. Proceed by fetching the items from the storage locations one after the other. Items that have already been picked can be viewed by tapping on the *Picked* tab.

For each item, the storage location at which it can be found as well as the required quantity and additional item information are displayed.

[TIP]
.Visibility of item images in plentyWarehouse
====
Are the item images that you have saved in your plentysystems back end not displayed in the item list? If that is the case, make sure that you have xref:item:import-export-create-directory.adoc#94[linked the images to the appropriate variations] in the plentysystems back end.
====

Depending on the setting you have carried out for the option xref:stock-management:mobile-pick-lists.adoc#intable-itemscan[Mandatory item scan], you can scan the items one after another or enter the quantity via the xref:stock-managment:mobile-pick-lists.adoc#intable-enter-quantity[quantity field].

As soon as all items have been picked, the message *All items picked* is displayed. Tap on material:done[] to finish the pick list.

[NOTE]
.Shortcuts in the item view
====
Additional shortcuts are available for each item on the pick list. You can use those shortcuts to conveniently carry out other work steps while processing a pick list. <<table-pick-list-shortcuts>> contains additional information on the available shortcuts.

=== Using a trolley tag

You can assign an optional trolley tag to a pick list before starting to work with a pick list or while processing it. To do so, make sure that the xref:stock-management:mobile-pick-lists.adoc#intable-trolley-tag[Enable entering a trolley tag] option has been activated in the settings.

On the one hand, a trolley tag is used to place a specific flag on the trolley that is used for picking items. For example, would you like to always pick items for Amazon orders with a specific trolley? Then you could assign the tag `Amazon` or use a specific QR code or barcode on the trolley. After doing so, assign the same tag to the desired pick lists in plentyWarehouse.

Proceed as described below to save a trolley tag for a pick list.

[.instruction]
Assigning a trolley tag:

. <<#310, Open the pick list>>.
. Tap on material:more_vert[] in the upper right corner.
. Enter a trolley tag. +
*_Or:_* Tap on (icon:barcode[role=darkGrey]) to scan a QR code or a barcode.
. Tap on *Add*. +
→ The trolley tag is saved with the pick list.

If you use xref:automation:processes.adoc#[Processes] for handling your orders, you can also use the trolley tag to filter for pick lists with a specific trolley tag and further process these pick lists. To do so, add the procedure *Pick list search* to your existing process in the plentysystems back end.

[.instruction]
Adjusting existing order processing:

. Go to *Setup » Processes » [Select process]*.
. Add the procedure. Carry out the settings according to <<table-trolley-tag-process>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

In the settings of the procedure, activate the option *Trolley tag*. Enter the trolley tag for which the procedure should filter. When proceeding with packing the items, your warehouse staff can simply scan the trolley tag to load the pick list into the process.
