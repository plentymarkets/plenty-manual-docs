You can think of properties as additional data fields that are not included in plentymarkets by default.
By creating properties, you can add information to your storage locations beyond just the standard data fields.
For example, the information that a storage location is suitable for items needing refrigeration.

//#video#

This page of the manual teaches you how to manually create properties step-by-step:

* xref:stock-management:properties.adoc#60[Create the properties] and xref:stock-management:properties.adoc#10[sort them into groups].
* xref:stock-management:properties.adoc#70[Link the properties] to the appropriate storage locations.

[#10]
== Groups

Over time, you’ll probably need many different properties for many different scenarios.
Groups help you keep track of it all.

[#20]
=== Creating a new group

First, create all of the necessary groups, e.g. the group “Warehouse Berlin”.

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties » Groups*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Create group*.
. Customise the settings to meet your needs.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

|Setting |Explanation

| ID
|As soon as you save the group, it automatically receives a consecutive and unique ID.
This ID cannot be changed.

| Position
|Enter the position number for the property group.
Properties are sorted by the position number in ascending order.
If a storage location has properties from multiple groups, then the groups will be displayed in ascending order.

*_Tip_*: Count by tens when creating position numbers. This allows you to easily add new property groups in between.

| Group type
|This option is not relevant for storage location properties.
It is intended for a different scenario: namely, for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties of the type None]

| Surcharge type
|This option is not relevant for storage location properties.
It is intended for a different scenario: namely, for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties]

== Properties

You can think of properties as additional data fields that are not included in plentymarkets by default.
By creating properties, you can add information to your storage locations beyond just the standard data fields.
For example, the information that a storage location is suitable for items needing refrigeration.

[#60]
=== Creating a new property

Create the properties that you’ll use to characterise your storage locations, e.g. the note “suitable for refrigerated items”.

.. Select the value from the drop-down list *Value*.
This field is only available if the property is of the type Selection.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The properties are linked with the storage location.
