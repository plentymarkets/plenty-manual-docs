include::partial$note-requirements.adoc[]

In addition to using the functionality in the xref:stock-management:taking-stock.adoc#[plentysystems back end], you can also take stock using the plentyWarehouse app. This manual page contains all information on the necessary preparatory settings and the process of taking stock with plentyWarehouse.

In addition, you can create and export inventory log exports in the plentysystems back end after taking stock with plentyWarehouse. For further information on this, refer to the <<#600, documenting stocktaking>> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Use labels for storage locations
====
To carry out stocktaking in plentyWarehouse, you need to generate a label for every storage location and place it at the respective storage location. During stocktaking, you use your device to scan the label to select the storage location for stocktaking.
Have you not created labels for storage locations yet? You can find the appropriate instruction on the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#800[Setting up a warehouse] page of the manual.

== Assigning rights for stocktaking

Before stocktaking is carried out in plentyWarehouse, make sure that all users without roles of the type *Administrator* have been assigned the appropriate rights. Otherwise, the counted stock cannot be registered and saved correctly both in the plentyWarehouse app and in the plentysystems back end.

[#100]
== Checking stock

Do you want to check all stock changes at once after completing stocktaking? Then start by using the export format xref:stock-management:taking-stock.adoc#200[catalogue format *Stocks*] to export your current stock.

After you have finished stocktaking with the plentyWarehouse app, use the xref:stock-management:taking-stock.adoc#400[import tool to create a data import]. Once you have created the import, you can view the stock changes for each item in the *Tab: Stock » Tab: Stock movement* area of the item. In addition, the import will be displayed as a separate entry in the *Stock » Incoming items* menu. Open this entry to view the stock changes.

[#300]
== Taking stock

When taking stock with the plentyWarehouse app, you can either scan each copy of an item individually or enter the counted quantity using the keypad. Use the [#option-itemscan]*Mandatory item scan* option described above to determine which method you want to use.

[#400]
=== Scanning each piece of an item individually

Users do not have to physically count the stock. Instead, they can scan the labels of each piece of an item repeatedly until they have scanned all pieces of an item present at the storage location. The quantity is updated incrementally in the background. For this counting method, the <<#option-itemscan, *Mandatory item scan*>> setting in the *Settings » Stocktaking* menu has to be activated.

[.instruction]
Scanning each piece of an item individually:

. xref:stock-management:installation-and-initial-setup.adoc#300[Log into plentyWarehouse].
. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]) in the top left corner. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Find the *Stocktaking* tile in the *Functions* area on the dashboard.
. Tap on *Stocktaking* (image:stock-management/plentywarehouse/assets/icon_stocktaking.png[width=24, height=24]).
. Scan the storage location label. +
→ The storage location is selected. The quantity of scanned items is booked to this storage location.
. Scan the label of each piece until you have scanned all items present at the storage location. +
*_Tip:_* If the storage location contains more than one type of item, the quantity of the correct item is increased automatically during scanning. +
*_Note:_* To correct the scanned quantity manually, tap on the item and enter the correct quantity. +
→ If best before dates, batches or both are managed for the variation in the selected warehouse, you are asked to enter a date, a batch or both. +
*_Optional:_* Select the best before date and/or enter the batch and tap on *Add item*. +
→ The stock is booked in.
. To finish the count, scan the storage location label again or tap on *Save stock* if the button is shown. +
→ The counted quantity is saved. +
→ The counted stock is imported to the *Stock » Storage location management* menu of the plentysystems back end. +
→ The stock information is saved in the *Item » Managing items* menu of the variation.

[#500]
=== Entering the counted quantity

Instead of scanning the label of each copy of the item stored at the storage location individually, warehouse staff can also count how many copies of an item are available at the storage location. After the counting process, the result is entered manually. For this counting method, the <<#option-itemscan, *Mandatory item scan*>> setting in the *Settings » Stocktaking* menu has to be deactivated.

[.instruction]
Entering the counted quantity:

. xref:stock-management:installation-and-initial-setup.adoc#300[Log into plentyWarehouse].
. Tap on the menu icon (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]) in the top left corner. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Find the *Stocktaking* tile in the *Functions* area on the dashboard.
. Tap on *Stocktaking* (image:stock-management/plentywarehouse/assets/icon_stocktaking.png[width=24, height=24]).
. Scan the storage location label. +
→ The storage location is selected. The quantity of scanned items is booked to this storage location.
. Scan the label of an item or search for the item manually. +
→ If best before dates, batches or both are managed for the variation in the selected warehouse, you are asked to enter a date, a batch or both. +
*_Optional:_* Select the best before date and/or enter the batch and tap on *Add item*. +
→ The *Enter quantity* window is displayed.
. Enter the quantity that you counted for the item.
. To finish the count, scan the storage location label again or tap on *Save stock* if the button is shown. +
→ The counted quantity is saved. +
→ The counted stock is imported to the *Stock » Storage location management* menu of the plentysystems back end. +
→ The stock information is saved in the *Item » Managing items* menu of the variation.

== Documenting stocktaking

After <<#100, importing and importing the stock>> and the actual <<#300, stocktaking with the plentyWarehouse app>>, the third important step is to create a legally compliant protocol of the results. For this purpose, the *Inventory log export* menu is available in the *Stock » Stocktaking* area. Depending on the selected filters, you can sort the contents of the inventory log export according to your requirements.

If necessary, start by assigning the appropriate user rights to employees that should be able to create inventory log exports but do not have an *Admin* account.

=== Exporting the inventory log

[.instruction]
Exporting the inventory log:

. Go to *Stock » Stocktaking » Inventory log export*.
. Carry out the desired filter settings. Pay attention to the information provided in <<table-inventory-log-filters>>.
. Click on *Generate PDF* or *Generate CSV*. +
*_Tip:_* <<#800, Read on below to get advice on selecting the appropriate file format>>. +
→ The inventory log is created and downloaded automatically.

.Available filters for exporting the inventory log
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *User*
|Select the user who carried out the stocktaking for which the inventory log should be exported.

| *Warehouse*
|Select the warehouse in which the stocktaking for which the inventory log should be exported was carried out.

| *Storage location*
|Enter the name of the desired xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#400[dimension] in this field to export an inventory log that contains the storage locations included in this dimension.

| *Date from*
|Select the start date for the period of time in which the stocktaking for which the inventory log should be exported was carried out.

| *Date to*
|Select the end date for the period of time in which the stocktaking for which the inventory log should be exported was carried out.

| *Sort by*
|How should the entries in the inventory log export be sorted? Select one of the options *Storage location*, *Date* or *User* to sort the entries accordingly.

| *Include purchase prices*
|Should the purchase prices for the counted variations be included in the inventory log export? +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = Two columns containing the purchase price and the moving average purchase price for the variation will be added to the inventory log export. For more background information on these two types of purchase prices, refer to the xref:stock-management:new-incoming-items.adoc#250[Managing incoming items] page of the manual. +
*Deactivated* (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) = The purchase prices for variations are not included in the inventory log export.

| *Only consider latest counting results*
|Which counting results should be included in the inventory log export in case e.g. stocktaking has been carried out twice for a storage location within the selected period of time? +
*Activated* (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) = Only the latest counting result is included. +
*Deactivated* (icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"]) = If multiple counting result exist, every result is displayed individually. In other words, multiple entries can be created for the same storage location. Use this setting carefully, as it can lead to unclear data in the inventory log export.

=== Using the different formats for inventory log exports

You can download the inventory log export in CSV and PDF format. Choose the file format that is appropriate for your use case.

[tabs]
====
CSV file::
+
--
* The CSV file can be edited after it has been created. It is especially useful if you want to add further information manually. In addition, you should choose this file format if you wish to import the data into your accounting software or other tools for further processing.
--

PDF file::
+
--
* The PDF file cannot be edited after it has been created. Thus, it can serve as a receipt that you can use for your tax advisor and store for your own accounting purposes.

+
[IMPORTANT]
.Delay when generating PDF files
======
Depending on the filters you have selected for the inventory log export, generating the PDF files can take some time due to the quantity of data that has to be processed. For example, this is the case if you have selected filters for a high number of storage locations at once. Try using different filter settings to generate multiple smaller exports. We are already working on fixing this behaviour so that a quicker generation of PDF files will be possible.
