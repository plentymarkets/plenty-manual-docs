[#plugin-settings]
=== Carrying out the settings for the Shopify plugin

*_Note:_* Note that item related import and export processes cannot be active at the same time.

[[table-shopify-plugin-settings]]
.Settings in the *Plugin settings* tab
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Setting | Explanation

2+| *Processes*

| *Order import*
| * every 15 minutes +
After a first order import, only Shopify orders posted in the last 24 hours will be imported. Orders which have already been fulfilled on Shopify will not be imported. +

The following data is imported: +

* External order ID
* Invoice address
* Delivery address
* Contact details (linked to the recipient)
* *Order comments*
* Ordered items and variation IDs +
→ plentymarkets items are linked to the order only if the SKU in plentymarkets and Shopify are identical. +
→ Discount payments contained in Shopify orders are imported as separate order items. +
* Item text
* Ordered quantities
* Item prices excluding surcharges and discounts
* Discounts
* Payment method +
→ *_Note:_* The plugin recognizes the payment methods *Paypal* and *Cash in advance* if a payment method with that name exists on Shopify. All other payment methods are imported as *Shopify Direct Checkout*. +
* Shipping profile +
→ Based on *shipping profile mappings*. +
* Properties

*_Note:_* The VAT rate is assigned by plentymarkets if a match is found. If no match is found, the standard VAT rate from pelntymarkets is assigned. To handle Shopify gift cards, create a plentymarkets item with 0% VAT and the same SKU as the Shopify gift card. During the order import, the SKU is matched and the Shopify gift card is assigned to the plentymarkets item automatically.

| *Customer import*
| * once a day +
Imports the Shopify customer base into plentymarkets. +
*_Note:_* Contact details are also imported during the order import. For more information, see <<#gdpr, GDPR considerations>>.

| *Stock and price import*
| * hourly for up to 1000 entries +
* once a day for more than 1000 entries +
This process is based on item mappings created during the item import. This process can only be carried out after an initial item import. The *RRP (Shopify: Compare at Price)* is not updated during this process.

| *Stock and price export*
| * every 15 minutes +
Exports stock and prices without using the *item export*. +
Exports stock and prices for variations with stock changes within the last 15 minutes. The *RRP (Shopify: Compare at Price)* is not updated during this process. +
*_Note:_* Variations for which only the price was changed will not be exported. Those variations will only be exported after the stock has changed.
 +

* When using the stock and price export combined with the item export: +
If you create a new variation in plentymarkets or if you change or add an SKU, then the variation will be exported within an hour. Afterwards, plentymarkets will check stock and price changes every 15 minutes. +

* When using the stock and price export without the item export: +
If you create a new variation in plentymarkets or if you change or add an SKU, then stock changes for this variation will be exported within 24 hours during the night. +
_Why?_ All SKUs and variation IDs have to be synchronised between plentymarkets and Shopify prior to the export. Because of the huge amount of data, this process can only be executed once a day.

| *Category import*
| * once a day +
Imports manual *collections* as categories. +
*_Note:_* *Collections* linked to an item will also be imported during the item import. +
*_Important:_* The plugin does not support *automatic Shopify collections*. Images mapped with a category will not be imported.

| *Category export*
| * once a day +
Exports all categories as manual *Shopify collections*. Categories linked to an item can also be exported with the item export. +
*_Note:_* Shopify does not support category trees. Therefore, only the sub-category will be exported. Images mapped with a category will not be imported.

|*Item import*
| * once a day +
Imports your Shopify items into plentymarkets. +

The following data is imported: +

* Item name
* Item text
* Linked categories
* Attributes
* Item variations
* Stock
→ The stock limitation from the field *inventory_policy* is also imported. +
* Manufacturer
* Weight and weight unit
* Sales price +
→ A sales price for the order referrer Shopify will be created if it doesn’t already exist. +
* SKU
* Item and variation images
* Tags
* Customs tariff number
* Purchase price
* Manufacturing country

| *Item export*
| * once a day for the initial import and afterwards hourly for updates +
Exports your items to Shopify. +
*_Note:_* If you delete Shopify items to export them once again, then the item export will take one more day to clean up the plugin data base. This has to be done before items which were deleted can be exported again. +

The following data is exported: +

* Manufacturer
* Customs tariff number +
*_Note:_* The plugin only exports the first 6 characters of the customs tariff number. Spaces are also removed. +
* Linked categories +
*_Note:_* Items are exported without category mappings by default. +
* Category meta-title
* The meta description of the category.
* Meta-keywords
* Tags
* Item name
* Item text
* Attributes
* Item variations
* Item variation position
* Sales price +
→ The sales price with the lowest position within the item. +
* Recommended retail price +
→ plentymarkets exports the *RRP* to the field *Compare at Price* in Shopify. According to the Shopify rules, the *Compare at Price* _must_ be higher than the regular sales price. If you want to remove the exported *Compare at Price* from an item in Shopify, then the exported *RRP* in plentymarkets has to be *0*. The price will then be removed. If you delete the *RRP* from the item in plentymarkets, then this change will not be transferred to Shopify. +
* SKU
* Barcode
* Stock +

*_Note:_* Note that all translatable input fields have to be set up. Otherwise, this function will not work properly.

| *Stock buffer*
| Whenever stock is exported to Shopify, the amount entered as stock buffer will be subtracted.

| *When exporting an item, also export its categories*
| Export categories linked to an item with the item export.

| *Import SKU into variation no.*
| Imports SKUs from Shopify items to the input field *Variation no.*. +
*_Note_:* Note that the plugin only functions properly with a unique Shopify SKU. If two variations with the same SKU are found, then only the first SKU is imported. 

| *Arrange exported variations by position nr.*
| Arranges exported variations according to their position. +
*_Note:_* Note that using this function will increase the runtime and the number of API calls. We recommend to only use this function if the position of the variations is important.

*_Note:_* The stock for exported items of the type *production items* will not be updated once this setting has been activated.

[#gdpr]
== GDPR considerations

Due to GDPR specifications, the following policy in regard to customer accounts and orders has been implemented:

*Table 4* _GDPR considerations for the order import_

[[table-shopify-gdpr]]
.GDPR considerations for the order import
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Scenario | Explanation

| *Customer is imported as guest*
| If:

* The customer has no plentymarkets account.
* The authenticity of the customer isn't guaranteed by either part, even if the contact details on several orders are the same.

*_Note:_* You can convert contacts of type *Guest* to regular contacts if required.

| *Customer is imported as regular contact*
| The plugin creates a regular account if the authenticity of the Shopify contact is guaranteed by a unique external contact ID.

| *An existing plentymarkets contact is linked to the imported order*
| It is checked whether a Shopify contact with this external contact ID has already been imported in the past. If a contact is found, then the new order is attached to this customer.
