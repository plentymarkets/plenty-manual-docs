== Activating the order referrer

:referrer: WooCommerce

*_Important:_* Note that the plugin cannot use order referrers that were created manually.

== Setting up the interface in plentymarkets

Carry out the following settings in plentymarkets to set up the interface to WooCommerce. Keep the credentials to hand that you received from WooCommerce during the registration process.

=== Connecting to the WooCommerce API

Connect to the WooCommerce API. To do so, you need the credentials you received from WooCommerce.

[.instruction]
Connecting to the WooCommerce API:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » WooCommerce » Tab: Connection*. +
*_The menu is not there?_* Then go to *Setup » Orders » Order referrer* to activate the order referrer.

Otherwise, orders that are imported using the new connection might be assigned to existing customers that were created with the old connection.

Each new connection requires a separate plentymarkets client and WooCommerce account. As such, you need a separate plentymarkets client for each WooCommerce shop.

*_Important:_* You also need to select a new plentymarkets client when you change the WooCommerce shop in an existing connection.

[.instruction]
Connecting additional WooCommerce webshops:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » WooCommerce » Tab: Connection*.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Webshops*
| Switch between different WooCommerce connections.

2+^| *Processes*

| *Order import*
| Runs every 15 minutes.

The order import process also performs a *Payment status update* for already imported orders.

|*Stock export*
| The stock export runs dynamically based on the number of variations to update:

* Every 15 minutes for up to *500* variations.
* Hourly for *500 to 1500* variations.
* Once a day for more than *1500* variations.

*_Important:_* SKU must be identical in plentymarkets and WooCommerce for this process to work.

| *Price export*
| Runs every 15 minutes.

[#faq]
== FAQ and troubleshooting

[.collapseBox]
.A customer number was assigned more than once. The wrong contact was assigned to an order. What's happening?
--

*_Problem:_*

You probably used a plentymarkets client for a WooCommerce webshop that is or was already connected to a different WooCommerce webshop at some point. So you either changed existing connection settings or you had a WooCommerce webshop in the past that you deleted.
That is a problem because you need to use a fresh plentymarkets client for each new WooCommerce webshop. Fresh means that the client has never been used for a WooCommerce webshop.

*_Solution:_*

Create a new client and link this client to the WooCommerce webshop.

*_Background:_*

For each WooCommerce webshop, external contact IDs are assigned in ascending order. If an order is imported for the new connection with a contact ID that was already assigned for this client, the order is assigned to the existing contact.
