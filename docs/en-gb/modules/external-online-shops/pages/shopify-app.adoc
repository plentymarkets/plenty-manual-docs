=== Importing custom order properties

The Shopify integration also enables you to import custom order properties via the *Order import* process. An example is the link:https://apps.shopify.com/product-personalizer[Product Personalizer plugin^] which allows you to record custom notes, such as custom engravings. +
If you want to import such properties, make sure that the plentymarkets item has a characteristic where the option *Order characteristic* is activated. This can be done in the *Setup » Item » Characteristics* menu. When creating a new characteristic, tick the *Order characteristic* box on the right.

[#90]
=== Setting up event procedures

plentymarkets event procedures enable you to better manage your orders on Shopify. More information regarding plentymarkets event procedures can be found on the xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc[event procedures] manual page.

[#100]
=== GDPR considerations

Due to GDPR specifications, the following policies for customer accounts and orders have been implemented.

[[table-gdpr-considerations]]
.GDPR considerations for the contact import
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|*Scenario* |*Explanation*

| *Customer is imported as guest*
| If the customer doesn't have a plentymarkets account, the authenticity of the customer isn't guaranteed by either part, even if the contact details on several orders are identical. +

*Tip:* You can convert contacts of the type *Guest* to regular contacts if required. For more information, see the xref:crm:quick-search.adoc#convert-guest-account[quick search] manual page.

| *Customer is imported as regular contact*
| If the authenticity of the Shopify customer is guaranteed by a unique external contact ID, a regular account is created.

| *An existing plentymarkets contact is linked to the imported order*
| It is checked whether a customer from Shopify with this external contact ID has already been imported in the past. If this is the case, the new order import is linked to the contact.

=== Connecting additional Shopify shops

Each new connection requires a separate plentymarkets client and Shopify account.
To create an additional connection you need to install the plentymarkets app in each Shopify shop you wish to connect.
