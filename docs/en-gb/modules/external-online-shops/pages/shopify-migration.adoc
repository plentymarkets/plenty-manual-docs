[#BICQDCDB]
== Step 1: Installing the plentymarkets app in your Shopify back end

First, install the plentymarkets app in your Shopify back end. 

include::shopify-app.adoc[tag=migration-installation]

[#BICQDFDB]
== Step 2: Check the plugin version

You need the current version of the Shopify plugin to migrate.

The migration assistant checks your plugin version for you. If your plugin is deinstalled or not up-to-date , you can update or install the plugin directly from the assistant.

Go to *Setup » Markets » Shopify app » Migration assistant* to complete the migration assistant.

Four different things can happen in the migration assistant:

*_Scenario 1:_* Your plugin is up to date. Great. Then you are ready for the next step. +
*_Scenario 2:_* You plugin is outdated. The migration assistant asks you to update the plugin before you can continue. +
*_Scenario 3:_* You had an active Shopify connection in the past. However, the Shopify plugin is not installed in your system now. If you want to migrate this connection, follow the steps in the migration assistant to update the plugin. +
*_Scenario 4:_* You do not have a plugin. You also have no active plugin connections to Shopify. Then you're all done because no migration is necessary.

[#VWKZZVIE]
== Step 3: Migrating the Shopify account

Now, migrate your Shopify connections.

For each active connection to Shopify, you carry out the following steps separately. So if you have more than one connection, you will migrate several databases. You do not need to migrate all your connections in the same session. However, note the instructions regarding event procedures below if you only migrate some of your connections now. 

NOTE: You do not need to migrate all connections in a single session. However, note the instructions regarding event procedures if you only migrate some of your connections now.

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Shopify app » Migration assistant*.
. Select the connection from the drop-down list *Connection*. +
*_Important:_* The drop-down list only contains connections for Shopify shops in which the plentymarkets app is already installed.
. Click on *Migrate*. +
-> The settings for the Shopify account are updated to the app connection. +
*_Tip:_* You will check these settings later in the Shopify assistant.

== Step 4: Migrating the event procedures
