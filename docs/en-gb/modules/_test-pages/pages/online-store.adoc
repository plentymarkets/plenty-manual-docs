== Customising the design

The standard design Ceres is customisable to fit your needs. Note that customised changes of the design cannot be taken into consideration if support should be required. Therefore do not make changes to your active design and, before making changes to the design, make a backup copy so that you can restore the original state of the design. For a detailed guide for template plugins and for individualising designs, refer to **link:https://developers.plentymarkets.com/dev-doc/template-plugins[plenty Developers]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]**. In order to customise the design, open the plugin **Ceres** first.

[.instruction]
Opening the plugin:

. Go to **Start » Plugins**. +
→ The plugin overview will open.
. Click on **Ceres**. +
→ The plugin will open in a new tab.

In the new tab, the directory tree will be displayed on the left. The **resources** folder contains the following sub-folders:

* **css**: contains CSS files generated from SCSS files. CSS files can be customised. However, the files will be overwritten, when changing SCSS files.
* **documents**: contains documents, e.g. fonts
* **images**: contains image files, e.g. the company logo or the slider images of the home page
* **js**: contains JavaScript files
* **lang**: contains files to make the online store available in different languages
* **scss**: contains SCSS files, e.g. bootstrap
* **views**: contains subfolders with twig templates for online store components. Templates are grouped by content:
* **Basket**: contains templates required for the shopping cart
* **Category**: contains templates required for displaying categories and item lists
* **Checkout**: contains templates required for the checkout
* **Customer**: contains templates for customer registration, login and guest accounts
* **Item**: contains templates or snippets to display item data
* **MyAccount**: contains templates required for the **My account** area
* **PageDesign**: contains global templates for basic page design, e.g. header, footer, navigation bar etc.

Make the desired changes to the code. Note that you have to use HTML and Twig syntax. Alternatively, edit the template plugin in an external editor. For an overview of recommended editors, refer to **link:https://developers.plentymarkets.com/dev-doc/basics#ide-support[Recommended IDEs]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]**.
