There are many reasons to export data from your plentymarkets system.
For example, you might want to:

== Catalogue

Catalogues are used to ideally prepare data for the export.
This tool is still relatively new in plentymarkets.
Additional functions are being added all the time.
Currently, you can use the catalogue to transfer data to the markets Amazon, Etsy, Metro and OTTO Market.
There’s also a demo function, which you can use to export item data, modify it and then re-import it.

How you proceed depends on what you want to achieve:

=== Advantages and disadvantages of the catalogue

*_Advantages_*:

* Predefined data structure:
The marketplace specifies which product data it needs.
You simply match your plentymarkets data fields with the expected data.
* Alternate data fields:
You decide which data field should be used as a replacement if a certain field is not available in plentymarkets.
* Combine data fields: You can combine data fields and decide which separator should be used between them.
For example: Name 1 + Name 2.

*_Disadvantages_*:

* Not yet compatible with all marketplaces.
* Currently only includes a demo standard format.
In the long-run, the catalogue is intended to replace the elastic export.
But first, all of the standard formats and export filters need to be implemented in the catalogue.
