Some online shop visitors know exactly what they’re looking for.
For example, imagine you sell shoes.
A customer searches for black Nike shoes that cost less than €150.
Online shop visitors can use search filters to limit which products they see.
The more products a shop category includes, the more important search filters are.

[TIP]
.Filters or facets?
====
In plentymarkets, search filters are also called _facets_.
Don’t get confused if someone talks about the so-called _faceted search_.
This refers to the search filters in the online shop.
====

[TIP]
.Requirements
====
This page assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#, import tool>>.
====

== Practical example: Initial situation

//tag::initialsituation[]
Imagine you sell shoes in your online shop.
For example, if customers should be able to search for black Nike shoes, then you’ll need to create the filters “Colour” and “Brand”.

//end::initialsituation[]

[TIP]
.What about a price filter?
====
//tag::pricefilter[]
Very few settings need to be configured for the price filter.
You’ll probably be quicker if you <<item/frontend-item-search#20, manually create the price filter>>.
For this reason, the price filter is not discussed further on this page.
//end::pricefilter[]
====

== Setting up the CSV file

//tag::csvfile[]
[discrete]
==== Filters

First, transfer the filters into a CSV file.
This is the file that you’ll import into plentymarkets later.
In our example, the filters would look like this in the CSV file:

image::data/importing-data/assets/best-practice-facets-filters.png[]

You are free to choose any names for the column headers.
In this example, I’ve put the following filter information in the columns:

* *Name* = The name of the filter, as it should be displayed in the online shop.
* *Type* = What sort of facet do you want to create?
Enter the type into the CSV file.
This setting can not be changed once you’ve created the facet.
<<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-facets#70, Further information about the type>>.
* *Sorting* = How should the values be sorted within the facet?
For example, if you’re creating the facet “Brand name”, then you could sort the individual brands alphabetically.
Enter your preferred sorting method into the CSV file.
<<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-facets#60, Further information about the sorting method>>.
* *SelectionType* = What should happen when customers select multiple filter criteria? Should they see products that fulfil _all of these criteria_ or _any one of the criteria_?
Enter your preferred selection type into the CSV file.
<<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-facets#100, Further information about the selection type>>.

[discrete]
==== Filter values

Now add the individual values to the filter.
For example, if you’re creating the filter “Colour”, then you’ll need values like “Blue”, “Red” and “Black”.

image::data/importing-data/assets/best-practice-facets-filtervalues.png[]

[discrete]
==== Linking filter values

Finally, link each filter value to existing data in your system, i.e. to existing attributes, characteristics, properties, manufacturers or availabilities.

image::data/importing-data/assets/best-practice-facets-filtervaluelinks.png[]

The link consists of two pieces of information:

* *LinkType* = What _sort of back end information_ do you want to link the facet value to?
Enter the appropriate type into the CSV file.
<<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-facets#190, Further information about the link type>>.
* *LinkID* = What _specific piece of back end information_ do you want to link the facet value to?
Enter the ID of the back end information into the CSV file.
<<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-facets#200, Further information about the ID>>.
//end::csvfile[]

== Choosing the import settings

//tag::syncsettings[]
<<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#1210, Create a new import>>.
Most of the settings can be chosen freely.
However, since you want to import _facet data_, make sure you’ve set the *Type* to *Facet*.
//end::syncsettings[]

== Choosing the matching settings

//tag::matching[]
During the import, plentymarkets will check whether the facet already exists.
This is done with the help of a so-called matching field.

Since we want to import _new facets_ in this example, configure the settings as follows.

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Facet name*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the facet name? Choose this column here.
This option is useful if you want to _create new facets_.

| *Import options*
|Since you’ll be importing new facets, choose the option *Only import new data* or *Import new, update existing data*.
|====
//end::matching[]

== Choosing the mapping settings

//tag::mapping[]
Your CSV file is already filled with a bunch of facet information.
Now you’ll decide _where in plentymarkets_ each piece of information should appear when you import the file.
<<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-facets#20, Take a look at this page>> while you map the columns of your CSV file to the fields in plentymarkets.
In this example, I’ve configured the settings as follows.

image::data/importing-data/assets/best-practice-facets-mapping.png[]

I created the filters by:

* mapping the *Name* column of my CSV file with the *Facet name / Name* data field in plentymarkets.
* mapping the *Type* column of my CSV file with the *Facet / Type* data field in plentymarkets.
* mapping the *Sorting* column of my CSV file with the *Facet / Sorting* data field in plentymarkets.
* mapping the *SelectionType* column of my CSV file with the *Facet / Selection type* data field in plentymarkets.

I created the filter values by:

* mapping the **ValueName* column of my CSV file with the *Facet value name / Name* data field in plentymarkets.

I created the links by:

* mapping the *LinkType* column of my CSV file with the *Link / Type* data field in plentymarkets.
* mapping the *LinkID* column of my CSV file with the *Link / Value ID* data field in plentymarkets.
//end::mapping[]

== Did it work?

//tag::check[]
Ready to import your filters?
Start the import and check whether the data was correctly imported into plentymarkets.

[.instruction]
Starting the import and checking the result:

. Activate the lines that should be imported (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]).
. Test the import (icon:plugin_stage_deploy[set=plenty]) or start the import (icon:play-circle-o[role="darkGrey"]). +
*_Note:_* This can take a few minutes.
. Go to *Setup » Client » Settings » Services » Faceted search*.
. Open a few filters to check their settings and values.
//end::check[]

[TIP]
.Do a trial run
====
//tag::testrun[]
We recommend testing the import (icon:plugin_stage_deploy[set=plenty]) before you start it for the first time.
This imports the first 10 rows of the file and bypasses the cache.
It gives you time to check whether the import works correctly. If the import does not perform as expected, you can correct it before importing the entire file.
//end::testrun[]
====

[TIP]
.Resetting the cache
====
//tag::cache[]
Directly within the import, you’ll find the button *Reset cache* (icon:reload[set=plenty]).
This button allows you to reset the import cache in order to reimport a file that does not contain any changes.
//end::cache[]
====

== After the import: webshop settings

Once you’ve imported the filters, you’ll still need to configure a few settings so that the filters appear in the webshop.

* <<item/frontend-item-search#110, Specify which webshop the filters should appear in>>.
* <<item/frontend-item-search#150, Design the appearance in the webshop>>.
