|Setting |Explanation

| *Characteristic ID*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the characteristic IDs? Choose this column here. This option is useful if you want to _update existing characteristics_.

*_Background info_*: Every new characteristic automatically receives an ID, which can not be changed. The ID is used to uniquely identify the characteristic. Because the ID is unique, it’s a good way to check whether the imported data record already exists in plentymarkets.

| *Characteristic group ID*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the group IDs? Choose this column here. This option is useful if you want to _update existing characteristic groups_.

*_Background info_*: Every new characteristic group automatically receives an ID, which can not be changed. The ID is used to uniquely identify the group. Because the ID is unique, it’s a good way to check whether the imported data record already exists in plentymarkets.

| *Characteristic name*
|Which column of your CSV file contains the characteristic name? Choose this column here. This option is useful if you want to _create new characteristics_.

| *Characteristic group name*
|Which column of your CSV file contains the characteristic group name? Choose this column here. This option is useful if you want to _create new characteristic groups_.
