== Importing contact data

In this chapter, we describe how to import contact data in plentymarkets. You need a CSV file with the data that you would like to import. Save this file on your computer. Then, proceed as follows.

[TIP]
.Structure of the file: Example file with sample data
====
Click on this link:https://cdn02.plentymarkets.com/pmsbpnokwu6a/frontend/ElasticSync_BestPractice/BP_Musterdaten_Kontaktdaten.csv.zip[link^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] to open an example file with sample data that you can use as an example to import contact data.
====

[.instruction]
Carrying out the basic settings:

. Go to *Data » Import*.
. Click on the plus sign *Add import* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Enter a name in the area *Basic data*.
. Select from the drop-down list *Type* the option *Contacts, companies, addresses*.
. In the *Import* section, you can leave the settings as they are.
. In the *Separator* section, select the option *Tab*.
. In the *Source* section, select the option *HTTPS*. +
→ Two further lines are displayed.
. In the drop-down list *HTTP options*, select the option *Data upload*.
. In the line *URL*, click on the button with the three dots (*Select file*). +
→ A new window opens.
. Click on *Upload file*, select the CSV file with the contact data that you would like to import and click on *Open*.
. Place a check mark in the line of the file or click once in the line of the file. +
→ The URL – i.e. the path from that you uploaded the CSV file – is now displayed in grey in the field *URL*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

You have uploaded the CSV file successfully. In the following, carry out the matching and mapping settings.

[.instruction]
Carrying out the matching settings:

. Click on *Matching* on the left side.
. In the *Matching* section, you have to assign at least one of the four available options to one of the fields from the CSV file. +
→ *_Note:_* If there is no contact ID available yet, it makes sense to carry out the matching via the email address.
. In the *Import options* section, select the option *Only import new data.*
. Select the decimal number and the date format, if required.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Now adjust the settings for mapping.

[.instruction]
Carrying out the mapping settings:

. Click on *Mapping* on the left side.
. Click on the plus sign *Add mapping* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Enter a name.
. Enter a position number.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The *Import data / plentymarkets data fields* section opens.

In this section, you assign the fields from your CSV file to the fields in plentymarkets. On the left side in the *Import data* section, you can see the header names from your CSV file. plentymarkets has already taken these names automatically from your CSV file.

On the right side in the *plentymarkets data fields* section, you have to select the corresponding counterpart from the list.

[TIP]
.Mandatory fields for contact data
====
When importing contact options, the fields *Type* and *Referrer* are mandatory fields. These two fields are marked with an asterisk (***). +
We recommend entering ID 1 for the referrer, because ID 1 covers both the referrer *Online store* and all marketplaces. ID 0 (= manual entry) will not be effective, because the entry via the import tool is not a manual entry in the strict sense.
====

[.instruction]
Example: Assigning the source *First name* to the appropriate plentymarkets data field

. On the left side, you can see the source *First name*. Click on the right side in the same line and enter *First name* in the search field.
. Click on *First name*.
. Click on the green tick *Select* (icon:check[role="green"]) below the list.
. Activate the toggle button *Activate line* in this line on the left side. +
→ The toggle button has to be switched from icon:toggle-off[role="red"] to icon:toggle-on[role="green"]. +
→ *_Important:_* All data fields to be imported have to be activated in order for the mapping to work correctly.
. Click on the button *Field* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) on the bottom left side.
. Select from the drop-down list *Own value*.
. Enter 1 as value. +
→ *_Note:_* 1 stands for the referrer *Online store* and all other marketplaces.
. Enter *Referrer* on the right side in the search field.
. Click on *Referrer**.
. Click on the green tick *Select* (icon:check[role="green"]) below the list.
. Activate the toggle button *Activate line* in this line on the left side. +
→ The toggle button has to be switched from icon:toggle-off[role="red"] to icon:toggle-on[role="green"].
. *Save* the settings.

Click on *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) in order to display a preview of the file and to check the content.

Last, but not least: click on the play button *Execute import* (icon:play-circle-o[]). Depending on the data volume to be imported, this may take a while. Once the import is carried out, the message *Import finished* is displayed.

Now go to *CRM » Contacts* in order to check whether the contact data was successfully imported.
