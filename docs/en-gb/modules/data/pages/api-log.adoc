== Filtering log entries

By default, entries are sorted in descending order by their ID. The entries can be filtered so that fewer search results are displayed in the list. You can filter entries with a specific API name or date.

[.instruction]
Filtering log entries with a specific name:

. Go to **Data » API log**.
. Select a format from the drop-down list **Process**.
. Click on **Search** to carry out the search.

[IMPORTANT]
.Format is not listed
====
The formats are not included in the **Process** drop-down list until the process has been carried out once and therefore has been logged. If a particular format is not included in the list, then it means that the process has not been carried out yet or that this particular error has not occurred.
====

[.instruction]
Filtering log entries with a specific date:

. Go to **Data » API log**.
. Select a **date** from the calendar.
. Click on **Search** to carry out the search.

Of course, both filters can be used together if you only want to see the entries that have a specific API name and a specific date.

== Process: Email

The **Email** process contains error messages that relate to emails, e.g. when emails cannot be sent or when email accounts or addresses are not configured correctly. The process is added to the drop-down list when such an error occurs for the first time.

If it was not possible to register an order and the registration process was carried out again, then plentymarkets will automatically change the order ID when the order is registered. This is because DHL Fulfillment only accepts an order ID once, even if the registration was not successful. Nonetheless, the Parameter column lists the correct order ID in plentymarkets. However, the file that is displayed in the Process column contains the ID that was used when registering the order with DHL Fulfillment.

=== DHLFulfillment Transport

This entry is recorded in the log when orders are sent. There is 1 possible event for this entry. The event indicates whether or not the order was sent.

The Parameter column lists the order IDs and delivery order IDs. If delivery orders were created, then a slash (/) is used to separate the delivery order from the order. For example, 1957/1956 means that a delivery order with the ID 1957 was created for an order with the ID 1956.
