There are many reasons to export data from your plentymarkets system.
For example, you might want to:

* transmit your item and variation data to marketplaces.
* export a CSV file containing product data, warehouse data, order data etc.
Afterwards, you can revise the file and import it again.

The elastic export is a good tool for doing so.
It is a free plugin, which you can download from plentyMarketplace and add to your system.

How you proceed depends on what you want to achieve:
