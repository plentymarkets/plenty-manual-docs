:nav-alias: Using catalogues

Catalogues are used to ideally prepare data for the export. Here, a distinction is made between catalogues with marketplace formats and catalogues with standard formats.

[cols="1,3a"]
|====
| Catalogue format | Explanation

| *Marketplace format*
| You want to prepare variation data for the export to a sales channel?
Use <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#40, catalogues with marketplace formats>> to export variation data to markets and other sales channels. Currently, you can use catalogues to transfer data to the markets Etsy, Metro, OTTO Market and Amazon.

| *Default formats*
| You want to export specific data such as order or item data from your plentymarkets system? Use <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#110, catalogues with a standard format>> to export such data. +
*_Note_*: The standard formats will be transferred to the catalogue step by step. At the moment, the formats <<data/exporting-data/catalogues-manufacturers#, Manufacturers>>, *Newsletter recipients*, <<data/exporting-data/catalogues-orders#, Order>>, <<data/exporting-data/catalogues-purchase-orders#, Purchase order>>, <<data/exporting-data/catalogues-item#, Item (new)>>, <<data/exporting-data/exporting-stock-movements#, Stock movements>> and <<data/exporting-data/exporting-stocks#, Stocks>> are available.

== What is a catalogue?

Each sales channel requires different product data. Often, different product information have to be sent to the same sales channel for different product categories (pet food, household items, food, etc.).

Catalogues with marketplace formats allow you to customise information regarding your product portfolio to meet the requirements of each sales channel and target audience. You achieve this by mapping the individual data fields of a sales channel to a suitable plentymarkets data field. When your variation data is transferred to the sales channel, the sales channel’s data fields are then filled with the correct plentymarkets data.

Catalogues with marketplace formats offer the following advantages:

* The sales channel provides the data structure. As such, you know exactly which variation data is necessary to sell your products on this sales channel.
* You select which variation data you want to publish on each sales channel and for each format. For example, you can use properties to transfer different variation names and descriptions to different sales channels.

[TIP]
.Filtering by catalogue name
====
On the left of the catalogue overview, enter the name of the desired catalogue into the *Name* field and click on *Search* (icon:search[set=material]) or Enter to find the desired catalogue faster.
====

[#20]
== What is a marketplace format?

A marketplace format provides a framework of the data a sales channel can accept. As such, marketplace formats tell you what data can be transmitted to the sales channel.

A sales channel can offer more than one marketplace format, for example for different product categories (pet food, food, non-food, etc.) or for different languages. Check the documentation of the respective sales channel to find out which marketplace formats are available.

[TIP]
.Could not find a marketplace format?
====
The marketplace formats of some sales channel are only loaded into the *Data » Catalogues* menu when you deploy the sales channel’s plugin.

== Managing variation data using properties

<<item/settings/properties#500, Properties of the Item section>> allow you to save data for variations for which no default data fields are available in the plentymarkets back end. In the following, you will find some examples on how to use properties.

==== Example 1: Diameter information

*Use case:* +
A sales channel allows you to send the *diameter* and the *diameter unit* of your products. By default, you cannot save diameter data in the plentymarkets back end.

*Recommended:* +
<<table-diameter>> shows the recommended settings for sending diameter data to sales channels.

=== Mapping and linking data fields

In the *Mapping* tab of a catalogue you can map the sales channel’s data fields to your plentymarkets data fields. Depending on the product data you want to transfer, you either map a data field or a value. For example, you select which data field in plentymarkets contains the weight of variations. In the lower section you can map values. For example, you map the sales channel’s category “Pet food” to your plentymarkets category “Animal food”.

For the export of a data field you can map as many fields as you like. To do so, add further data fields and select a separator for each combination. Moreover, you can add so-called fallback data fields. In case a value does not exist, you can define here which value should be exported instead.

//tag::catalogue-menu[]
image::markets/assets/catalogue-menu-colours.png[]
__Menu structure of a catalogue with marketplace format__

In the following you will find explanations on the individual sections. +

* *Navigation*: Here you can switch between the different sections. Access the <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#50, catalogue settings>>, map the respective <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#80, plentymarkets data fields>> as well as <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#81, own data fields>> to the ones of the marketplace, or set <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#257, filters>> in order to narrow down data.
* *Toolbar*: Here you can carry out actions that are relevant for the catalogue, such as saving the mapping of the data fields.
* *Data fields of the marketplace*: Here, all available marketplace data fields are listed. Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk (*).
* *Mapped plentymarkets data fields*: Shows all data fields that have been mapped to the data fields of the marketplace for the export. Furthermore, you can add <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#82, own values>> and select <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#80, fallback data fields>> that are exported in case the mapped data field could not be found or is empty.
//end::catalogue-menu[]

[TIP]
====
.Additional mapping for specific data fields
Data fields such as VariationSalesPrice.price require an additional mapping, because more than one price may exist for each variation. The mapping allows you to export a specific sales price. To export more than one sales price, you can add the data field several times. Data fields that require additional mapping have a drop-down list. The default value is always preselected.
====

[NOTE]
.No free text fields or characteristics
====
Free text fields and characteristics have been replaced by properties. Thus, you cannot transfer free text fields and characteristics to sales channels anymore. Use the properties instead.
====

[TIP]
.Adding all data fields of a group at once
====
If you want to add all data fields of a group to a catalogue at once, click on the plus on the right of the group.
====

[#81]
[TIP]
.Adding own data fields
====
In the *Own data fields* area in the side navigation you can add your own data fields and specify a name.
 Make sure to choose an individual name for each data field. +
Note: This option is not available for all catalogues.
====

Proceed as described below to map the data fields of the sales channel to a plentymarkets data field.

[.instruction]
Mapping and linking data fields:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Click on a catalogue. +
→ The *Mapping* tab (icon:order_return_create_edit[set=plenty]) with the marketplace data fields opens. +

. Click on a group to expand the associated data fields. +
→ The data fields are shown.
. Next to the data field you want to select, click on the plus. +
→ The data field is added to the view. +
*_Or:_* Enter the name of the data field into the search field and navigate to the desired entry. Afterwards, press Enter to add it to the view. +
*_Tip_*: Do you want to export a fixed value for every variation for one of the marketplace data fields? Click on the plus next to *Own value*. +
→ The field for the own value is added to the view.
. If you selected *Own value*, enter a value into the input field below.
. Close the editing mode via the X or by clicking outside the window. +
*_Optional_*: Click on *Add fallback data field* to select a data field that is exported in case another one is not available. You can also add more than one fallback data field. +
*_Optional_*: To map another data field to an existing one, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[set=material]) on the right. +
→ The editing mode opens.

. Map the desired data fields.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=material]) the settings. +
→ The mappings are saved.

[#82]
[TIP]
.Own value
====
The option *Own value* allows you to export a fixed value for a data field. This fixed value is thus identical for each data record that is exported via this catalogue.
====

[TIP]
.Replacing data fields
====
Do you want to replace a data field in a specific position without having to delete linked data fields and to select new ones again? To do so, click on the further actions (icon:more_vert[set=material]) on the right of the data field you want to replace and select a new one.
====

[TIP]
.Moving data fields in a mapping
====
When mapping data fields, you can move each data field as desired. To do so, go to the respective data field and drag and drop it to the desired position.
====

[#85]
=== Transferring combined mappings to a marketplace

Combined mappings allow you to transfer data fields that have a dependency to a marketplace. +
_Example_ (see image below): You want to transfer the data field *Barcode* and additionally need the Barcode type *ASIN*. Therefore, you specify the Barcode type *ASIN* as additional information and define that this will be transferred, if the data field *Barcode* can be filled with the value from the plentymarkets data field *Amazon Germany*. +
If this is not possible, because no value can be found, the next possibility is checked. Thus, the Barcode type *GTIN* will be transferred to the marketplace, if the data field *Barcode* can be filled with the value from the plentymarkets data field *GTIN 13* _or_ *GTIN 128*. +
*_Note:_* In case none of the defined possibilities applies, neither *Barcode* nor *Barcode type* will be transferred.
