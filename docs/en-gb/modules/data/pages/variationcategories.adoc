The data format **VariationCategories** is used to export variation category links.
You can also use the data format <<data/export-import/data-formats/variation#, Variation>> to edit category links via data exchange.
The data format **VariationCategories**, however, is especially suited to create or edit multiple links per variation. +
For example, use the format **VariationCategories** to assign category links to newly imported variations.
Once you have imported the new variations, export the category links for your variations.
Open the CSV file and save values for the category links that you want to assign to newly imported variations.

Create and export the data format in the **Data Â» Dynamic export** menu.
The <<data/export-import/exporting-data#, Exporting data>> page of the manual describes how you export the data format.

Pay close attention to the exact spelling of the data fields. The data cannot be processed if the data fields are spelled incorrectly.

== Important notes

By using the data field **DeleteOld** with the value **1**, it is possible to delete old category links during the import. If you entered several category links per variation and these category links are all in different lines, then only enter the value **1** into the first line (see table 1).
