[IMPORTANT]
.Important: No new features planned for the dynamic export
====
The dynamic export in the *Data » Dynamic export* menu will not be developed any further. You can still see and use the function. However, no new features or extensions will be implemented.
====

Use the dynamic export in the *Data » Dynamic export* menu to manually export data from your plentymarkets system. With dynamic export, you can freely select the data fields, thus making it possible to individualise the data format's content.

==  Customising a file for data exchange

Generally, you will receive a CSV file during the data export. Regardless of whether you export data from an external system or from plentymarkets, it is generally necessary to make slight changes to the file before you import it into plentymarkets. Make sure to use UTF-8 coding when you export the data format. The data record has to be divided into columns, which will only happen if you are using the correct separator. If needed, try seeing what different separators look like in the file’s import preview.

==  Exporting customised data formats

In the *Data » Dynamic export* menu, you can create individual data formats, which contain exactly those data fields that you want to export. The data is exported in a file. You can then make this file available to a specific tool or interface, such as a specific market. You also edit existing data formats in this menu.

The xref:main@manual:data:data-formats.adoc[Data formats] page of the manual gives you an overview of the data formats that you can customise. The subpages provide detailed descriptions of the data formats. You will learn which data fields you need to activate and which filters and procedures you need to set so that your data will be exported correctly. Most of the data formats can be reimported to plentymarkets after you have edited them.

Depending on the data format type you select, the *Fields*, *Filter* and *Procedures* tabs will be available after you have created the new data format. The *Fields* and *Filter* tabs are available for every format and the Procedures only in a few. <<table-data-dynamic-export>> explains the tabs in the *Data » Dynamic export* menu.

.Tabs in the *Data » Dynamic export* menu
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Tab | Explanation

| *Fields*
| Activate the fields in the *Export* column to export this data. The name can be changed in the *Individual field name* column. This name is displayed as the column header in the export file. Select the option *None*, *Import* or *Synchronisation* in the *Import procedure* column. Use the *Position* column to define the position that the data field will be exported to in the output file.

| *Filter*
| Activate data fields or functions and select values for the filters. Afterwards, only the data will be exported that exactly matches the selected characteristics. +
There are different options available in the drop-down lists depending on the filter option you are working with. Selecting the data field allows you to edit the fields *Operator* and *Value*. Depending on the data field, you will either be able to select values from a drop-down list or values will have to be entered into a text field. +
*_Example:_* Place a check mark next to *ItemID* for the *data field/function* column. Select the operator *>* from the drop-down list and enter the item ID in the text field in the *Value* column. Only items with an ID higher than the one you entered will be exported.

| *Procedures*
| Select the procedure that is to be carried out. +
*_Example:_* Activate the *ItemLastUpdateTimestamp* procedure. Select the *set the current date* option from the drop-down list. A timestamp will be added to items during the export, indicating when the items were last changed.
|====

The data formats that you created can be exported from the *Fields* tab. The data is exported into a file. You also have the possibility of opening the export file in a spreadsheet program, editing it and then importing it into your plentymarkets system again.

Proceed as described below to export the data format.

[.instruction]
Exporting the data format:

.  Go to *Data » Dynamic export*.
.  Click on the *New data format* tab.
.  Select a *Data format type* from the drop-down list. +
→ A *Data format name* will be assigned automatically, which is composed of a name and a number. You can change the name.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The data format that you have just created will be listed in the *Edit data format* tab.
.  Expand the data format. +
→ The available tabs of the data format will be displayed.
.  Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-data-dynamic-export>>.
.  In the *Fields* tab, enter the *Number of lines* to be exported. Pay attention to the following note regarding the line limitation.
.  In the *Starting in line* field, enter which line the data export should begin from. +
→ Line 0 = Column title.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
.  Click on the gear-wheel icon *Export data*. +
→ The data will be exported in a CSV file.
.  Save the CSV file on your computer so that you can use it later.

[NOTE]
.Data export is limited to a maximum of 6000 lines
====
In the *Number of lines* line, you enter how many data records should be exported (one data record per line). The export is limited to a maximum of 6000 lines. +
If you want to export 10,000 lines, for example, then export the first 6,000 lines and carry out a second export afterwards. With the second export, enter the value 4000 in the *Number of lines* line and enter the value 6001 in the *Starting in line* line.

==  Exporting stock

The export of your stock is one step in the xref:main@manual:stock-management:taking-stock.adoc[process of stocktaking], for example. You will receive a CSV file containing all relevant data fields.

You can export your current stock by going to *Data » Dynamic export*. Use the data format *Stock*. Pay attention to the note about mandatory fields of this data format on the xref:main@manual:data:stock.adoc[Stock] page of the manual.

[.instruction]
Carrying out the data export:

.  Go to *Data » Dynamic export*.
.  Expand the data format *Stock*. +
→ If the data format is not available yet, create it as described above.
.  Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-export-options-dynamic-export>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
.  Click on the gear-wheel icon *Export data*. +
→ A CSV file will be generated. You can edit and reuse the file again later. For example, you could import the file after having edited the data as needed.

[[table-export-options-dynamic-export]]
.Dynamic export; export options
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| Setting | Explanation

| *Number of lines*
| Enter the number of lines that should be exported, assuming that you would like to limit this number (default setting: 6000).

| *Starting in line*
| If needed, enter which line the data export should begin from (default setting: 0).

| *Stock*
| Select one of the following options. This stock will be exported. +
*All* = All of the stock will be exported. +
*Below reorder level* = Stock data will only be exported for items that are below the reorder level. +
*Reorder level reached/below* = Stock data will only be exported for items that have reached or are below the reorder level. +
*Negative net stock or net stock is 0* = Stock data will only be exported for items with a net stock that is less than or equal to 0. +
*Negative net stock* = Stock data will only be exported for items with negative net stock. +
*Negative physical stock or physical stock is 0* = Stock data will only be exported for items with a physical stock that is less than or equal to 0. +
*Negative physical stock* = Stock data will only be exported for items with negative physical stock. +
*Positive net stock* = Stock data will only be exported for items with positive net stock. +
*Positive physical stock* = Stock data will only be exported for items with positive physical stock.

| *Item bundle*
| Select whether the data should be exported *with* or *without item bundles*.

| *Supplier*
| Select *ALL* or a specific supplier.
|====

You may decide that the CSV file contains data fields that you don’t need. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-export-options-dynamic-export>>. If so, then delete the unnecessary columns and save the file on your computer. In the *Stock* column, you can now enter the actual stock for each item. Determine the actual stock and enter the values into the *Stock* column within the CSV file. Save the changes.
