This manual page contains information on the export format *Payments*, which you can use in order to export payment data from your plentymarkets system by using catalogues.
If you are not familiar with the usage of catalogues yet, refer to the manual page xref:data:file-export.adoc#[Using standard formats] first. There you will find out how to create and manage catalogues.

[discrete]
==== Format type: Payments

The format type described on this page is found in the menu *Data » Catalogues*.
When creating a new catalogue, you’ll select the standard format from the upper drop-down list.
Then you can select the format type *Payments* from the middle drop-down list.

[TIP]
.No export to marketplaces
====
The export format *Payments* is a so-called standard format, which you can use to export data from your system, but not to transfer data to a marketplace.
====

[TIP]
.Adapting export keys
====
To the left of newly added data fields, you can enter an *Export key*. The export key is the name under which the values of a data field are grouped in your export file. The export keys can be adapted. +
Always make sure that the export key is unique especially when you add the same data field several times and select different options. If the same export key is used more than once only the data field which was added last with this export key is exported. +
Find more information on data fields in general in the manual chapter <<data/exporting-data/file-export#add-fields, Adding data fields to export>>.
