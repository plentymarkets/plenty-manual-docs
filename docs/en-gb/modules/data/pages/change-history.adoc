Curious who made changes to a specific item, price, order, etc.?
With the tools in plentymarkets, you can track changes to various data records.
For example, changes to:

* xref:data:change-history.adoc#100[Items and variations]
* xref:data:change-history.adoc#100[Prices]
* xref:data:change-history.adoc#100[Orders]
* xref:data:change-history.adoc#1300[Customer data]
* xref:data:change-history.adoc#1300[ShopBooster data]
* xref:data:change-history.adoc#1300[Data cleansing configuration]

[TIP]
.GoBD compliance
====
plentymarkets helps sellers comply with GoBD regulations as defined by the IDW PS 880 certification.
One aspect of GoBD compliance is the ability to retain documents that have financial or tax relevance over a long period of time.
To meet this requirement, you have to xref:data:change-history.adoc#1200[activate the change history and archive].
This may result in xref:data:change-history.adoc#1200[costs].
====

[#100]
== Change history

//tag::history[]

plentymarkets lets you track the entire life cycle of a data record, such as an item or an order.
This is particularly important with regards to the obligation to retain records.
The change history is composed of the following parts:

* xref:data:change-history.adoc#200[Search]: Change records that are less than six months old can be searched live.
* xref:data:change-history.adoc#1000[Archive]: After six months, the data is moved to an archive.
The data is still accessible there, but it can no longer be searched.
The changes are archived for 11 years.

[TIP]
.Protection against tampering
====
The change history is tamper-proof and trustworthy in the sense that users cannot modify or delete the entries.
Changes can only be retrieved and searched.
====

[#200]
=== Searching for recent changes

[#300]
==== Setting search filters

. Go to *Data » Change history*.
. Choose search filters in the middle column. Note <<table-change-history-search-filters>>.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The search results are displayed in an overview on the right.

[TIP]
.How do the search filters work?
====
* *_Auto-complete_*:
Simply enter the first few letters of a keyword into the search field and you will see matching results.
* *_Multiple selection_*:
You can enter multiple keywords into a field.
The keywords are displayed as so-called "chips".
* *_Dynamic filter values_*:
The drop-down list only displays values that are relevant for the selected time period.
For example, the value "Sales price of the variation" will only be displayed in the "Data record" filter if a sales price was actually modified during the selected time period.

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Search filters |Explanation

| *From/To* +
[red]#(Mandatory fields)#
|Choose an interval.
The changes made during this time period will be retrieved.

| *Data record*
|What type of data do you want to retrieve?
Enter a keyword into this field, e.g. item, order, sales price etc.

*_Tip_*: Simply enter the first few letters of the keyword and then use the auto-complete function.

| *Unique IDs*
a|This field is used to uniquely identify the data record.

. First, enter a keyword into the field.
The keyword specifies the _type of ID_, e.g. a sales price ID, variation ID or language ID.
. Then enter the actual ID into the field further below.

*_Note_*:
A data record may only become unique by combining two or more IDs.
For example, you could enter the variation ID 1234 and the sales price ID 567.
The results show you when sales price 567 was modified for variation 1234.

| *User*
|Do you want to search for changes that were made by a specific plentymarkets user account?
Enter the first few letters of the user name and then use the auto-complete function.

!Search filter !Explanation

! *Correlation*
!This field specifies which item, order, language etc. the data record belongs to.

. First, enter a keyword into the field.
The keyword specifies the _type of ID_, e.g. a sales price ID, variation ID or language ID.
. Then enter the actual ID into the field further below.

! *Type of change*
!Limits the search results to data records that were created, modified or deleted.

! *Source*
!Do you want to search for changes that originate from a specific source?
Enter the first few letters of the source name and then use the auto-complete function.

*_Examples_*:
Changes that resulted from a cron-job, changes that were made manually in the back end or changes that can be traced back to the REST-API interface.

*_Note_*:
Define the source even further by combining it with tags.

! *Tags*
!Tags define the source even further.

*_Example_*:
A tag could be the ID of an import process.
You can use this ID to limit the search results to changes that were made during the import process.

==== Working with the search results

Once you’ve xref:data:change-history.adoc#300[searched for changes], you’ll see the results in an overview on the right.
Expand a line in the overview (icon:chevron-right[role="darkGrey"]) to see more detailed information.
Each entry in the table answers the following questions:

* Who changed the data record?
* When was the data record changed?
* What was changed?
** Was the data record created, modified or deleted?
** Which value did the data record have before and after the change?
** Was the data changed manually or by a system process (e.g. import or REST-API)?

image::data:History-Results.gif[]

[TIP]
.Should I group the results?
====
Imagine an employee opened an item data record, entered new transportation costs, new storage costs and then saved the changes.

* icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] *Group the results* = The table only includes one entry for the save.
Once you expand the line (icon:chevron-right[role="darkGrey"]), you will see that both the transportation costs and the storage costs were changed.
* icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] *Group the results* = The table includes two separate entries for the save.
The table shows you which data fields were changed.

==== Examples of use

But that can’t be right!
The item’s purchase price is 82 EUR.

=== FAQ

[.collapseBox]
.*I want to comply with GoBD regulations. Which data should be logged?*
--

plentymarkets helps sellers comply with GoBD regulations as defined by the IDW PS 880 certification.
One aspect of GoBD compliance is the ability to retain documents that have financial or tax relevance over a long period of time.

To meet this requirement:

. Go to *Data » Change history*.
. Click on icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] *Settings*.
. Click on the upper button to simultaneously activate all of the settings necessary for GoBD compliance.
This button activates the archive and all of the data fields marked with an asterisk.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.
This may result in xref:data:change-history.adoc#1200[costs].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*What costs can be incurred?*
--

The following costs are incurred depending on usage:

* 15 cents per 10,000 logged changes.
* 15 cents per 10,000 archived changes.
* 1 euro for requesting a file from the archive.

So if you want to use plentymarkets in compliance with GoBD regulations - i.e. if you want to store relevant changes in plentymarkets for up to 11 years - then you will be charged 30 cents for every 10,000 changes.
The cost of a data package is only billed in the month in which it was logged.

[discrete]
===== Example

On average, a system makes 177,000 loggable changes during one month.
This corresponds to an average of 18 packages (177,000 / 10,000 rounded up).
If the change history and archive are both activated, then the average cost per month is 18 * 0.15 * 2 = € 5.40.

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I view my usage?*

Yes.
You can see up-to-date information about your usage, meaning your actual costs, any time.
