This page describes the data sources and filters that are available when exporting item and variation data with the catalogue tool.
This page serves purely as a reference and it assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the xref:data:file-export.adoc#[catalogue tool].

[discrete]
==== Format type: Item (new)

The format type described on this page is found in the menu *Data » Catalogues*.
When creating a new catalogue, you'll select the standard format from the upper drop-down list.
Then you can select the format type *Item (new)* from the middle drop-down list.

image::data:catalogue-item.png[]

[TIP]
.What's a standard format?
====

* *_Definition_*:
A standard format is used to export specific data from your system.
Afterwards, you can revise the data and import it again.

* *_Example_*:
Imagine you want to update the prices and descriptions for several items at once.
You could export a CSV file with the item data saved in your system.
Afterwards, you could revise the file and import it again.

* *_Differentiation_*:
Note that standard formats only export data from your system.
They do not transmit this data to marketplaces.

=== Default category

[TIP]
.Category vs. Default category
====

Variations can be linked to multiple categories:

* *_Category_*:
Imagine you sell a personalised bracelet.
You want the bracelet to appear in the category “Gifts” and in the category “Women's accessories”.

* *_Default category_*:
Decide which one of these categories should be the variation's default category.
The default category is the breadcrumb path displayed in the plentyShop.
If a variation appears in multiple categories, then the breadcrumb bar will always display the default category path.

* *_What is exported?_*:

** If you use “Item (new)” as a standard format, then it will only be possible to export information about the default category.
It is not currently possible to export information about other linked categories.
Possible workaround: Export the data with the tools xref:data:formatdesigner-item.adoc#1200[FormatDesigner] and xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#700[Elastic Export] instead.

** If you use “Item (new)” as a marketplace format (e.g. to transmit your product data to a sales platform), then you can export information about the default category and other linked categories.

|Field |Explanation

| *Category ID*
|The ID of the category.

| *Path*
|This data source corresponds to the category's breadcrumbs path.
Enter a separator, i.e. decide which symbol or character should appear between the individual category levels.

*_Example_*: If you use the separator `-` then a category path could look like this: `shoes-women-boots-uggs`

| *Branch 1*; +
*Branch 2*; +
*Branch 3*; +
*Branch 4*; +
*Branch 5*; +
*Branch 6*
|You can save up to 6 category levels in the plentysystems back end.
These data sources correspond to the individual levels of the category's breadcrumbs path.

*_Example_*:
Your system includes the category: Shoes » Women » Boots » Uggs.

* Branch 1 = Shoes
* Branch 2 = Women
* Branch 3 = Boots
* Branch 4 = Uggs

//Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:directory.adoc#30[Item » Items » [Open item\] » Stock » Column: Physical stock]

| *Net stock*
|The quantity of items that are available for sale.
The net stock is a subset of the physical stock.
Subtract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#95[Item » Edit item » [Open item\] » Tab: Stock » Column: Net]
//ToDo - neue Artikel-UI
//Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:directory.adoc#30[Item » Items » [Open item\] » Stock » Column: Net stock]

| *Reserved stock*
|The quantity of items that are reserved.
A variation will be reserved as soon as an order or a warranty is created.
The stock is reserved until either outgoing items are booked or until the order or the warranty is cancelled.
The reserved stock is part of the physical stock because the reserved stock is still present in the warehouse.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#95[Item » Edit item » [Open item\] » Tab: Stock » Column: RS]

//Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:directory.adoc#30[Item » Items » [Open item\] » Stock » Column: Reserved stock]

| *Reorder level Delta*
|The difference to the reorder level.
The difference either tells you how many items still need to be sold in order to reach the reorder level or it tells you how many items you need to reorder to reach the reorder level.
This means if the difference is negative your stock is still above the reorder level.
If the difference is positive, your stock is below the reorder level.

Texts can be saved in multiple languages.
Use the drop-down list to specify which language version of the text you want to export.
If you want to export the text in multiple languages, then you will have to add the data source multiple times.

|If you export a file in CSV or TXT format, then you'll only see the word "Array" instead of the actual export values.

*_This means_*:
It's not possible to tell which selection values were linked to the variation.
This is a known issue and it will be fixed in the future.

*_Possible workaround 1_*:
Would it be an option for you to download a JSON or XML file instead?
With these file types, you can see which selection values were linked to the variation.

. Click on icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] *Settings*.
. Scroll down to the section *Format settings*.
. Select JSON or XML from the drop-down list *Format*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings and download the file (material:file_download[]).

* *_Caution_*: If you want to revise the file and import it again.
Note that the xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool] only accepts the file types CSV and TXT.

*_Possible workaround 2_*:
Export the data with the tools xref:data:formatdesigner-item.adoc#1600[FormatDesigner] and xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#700[Elastic Export] instead.

[TIP]
.Default name of the “Export Key”
====
By default, the export file's column header is given the name: "property-GroupID-PropertyID".

* *_Example_*: the column header "property-3-17" means that the export data relates to the property with the ID 17.
And that this property is included in the group with the ID 3.

|===
|Field |Explanation

| *Sales price*
|Select a currency and one of the the xref:item:prices.adoc#[sales prices] that you've already configured in the menu *Setup » Item » Sales prices*.
This causes xref:item:managing-items.adoc#240[the actual monetary price], which is saved in the variation data record, to be exported.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#240[Item » Edit item » [Open variation\] » Tab: Settings » Area: Sales prices]
//ToDo - neue Artikel-UI
//Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:directory.adoc#340[Item » Items » [Open variation\] » Element: Sales prices]

*_Example_*: Catalogue data source and variation data field

* *Sales price* = B2B customers
* *Currency* = Euro
* *Monetary price* = 15.99

| *Lowest price automatically detected*
|Indicates whether the lowest price of the last 30 days was automatically calculated.

* Empty line = No, the lowest price was _not_ automatically calculated.
* `1` = Yes, the lowest price was automatically calculated.

*_Note_*: If you export the information in JSON format, then you will receive the values "true" and "false" rather than an empty line and "1".

[.collapseBox]
.*What does “Export Key” mean?*
--

The “Export Keys” are the names of the column headers, as they will appear in your export file.
Every “Export Key” needs to be unique.

* *_Negative example_*: You use the data sources xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#60[Item ID] and xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#110[Variation ID].
You give both “Export Keys” the name “id”.
As a result, the export file only includes one of the two IDs.
A column is missing in the export file.
* *_Positive example_*: You use the data sources xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#60[Item ID] and xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#110[Variation ID].
You give one “Export Key” the name “VariationID” and the other “ItemID”.

.*What does “Comparative value” mean?*
--

When you add a data source, you'll see the option “Comparative value”.
This option is accidentally displayed here.
It is not intended for standard formats, but rather for other use-cases.
This is a known issue and it will be fixed in the future.
Until then, simply leave the “Comparative value” option blank since it doesn't affect the standard format.

.*I only see the folder “Default category”. Can I also export the other categories?*
--

Variations can be linked to multiple categories:

* *_Category_*:
Imagine you sell a personalised bracelet.
You want the bracelet to appear in the category “Gifts” and in the category “Women's accessories”.

* *_Default category_*:
Decide which one of these categories should be the variation's default category.
The default category is the breadcrumb path displayed in the plentyShop.
If a variation appears in multiple categories, then the breadcrumb bar will always display the default category path.

* *_What is exported?_*:

** If you use “Item (new)” as a standard format, then it will only be possible to export information about the default category.
It is not currently possible to export information about other linked categories.
Possible workaround: Export the data with the tools xref:data:formatdesigner-item.adoc#1200[FormatDesigner] and xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#700[Elastic Export] instead.

** If you use “Item (new)” as a marketplace format (e.g. to transmit your product data to a sales platform), then you can export information about the default category and other linked categories.

.*My export file is missing a column. Why?*
--

You might have data sources with the same “Export Key”.
Every “Export Key” needs to be unique.

* *_Negative example_*: You use the data sources xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#60[Item ID] and xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#110[Variation ID].
You give both “Export Keys” the name “id”.
As a result, the export file only includes one of the two IDs.
A column is missing in the export file.
* *_Positive example_*: You use the data sources xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#60[Item ID] and xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#110[Variation ID].
You give one “Export Key” the name “VariationID” and the other “ItemID”.

[.collapseBox]
.*Only the word “Array” is exported. Why?*
--

If you export a file in CSV or TXT format, then you might only see the word "Array" instead of the actual export values.
This happens e.g. when exporting multiple images or when exporting multi-selection properties.
This is a known issue and it will be fixed in the future.

*_Possible workaround 1_*:
Would it be an option for you to download a JSON or XML file instead?
With these file types, you can see the actual export values.

. Click on icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] *Settings*.
. Scroll down to the section *Format settings*.
. Select JSON or XML from the drop-down list *Format*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings and download the file (material:file_download[]).

* *_Caution_*: If you want to revise the file and import it again.
Note that the xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool] only accepts the file types CSV and TXT.

*_Possible workaround 2_*:
Export the data with the tools xref:data:item.adoc#[FormatDesigner] and xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#700[Elastic Export] instead.

.*Can I revise the file and import it again?*
--

Yes.
Export the file in CSV or TXT format.
Then revise the file and import it again.
