The data format **Item** contains all of the data fields for item data.
Create and export the data format in the **Data » Dynamic export** menu.
The <<data/export-import/exporting-data#, Exporting data>> page of the manual describes how you export the data format.

Pay close attention to the exact spelling of the data fields. The data cannot be processed if the data fields are spelled incorrectly.

[#10]
== Important notes

Each item is given a number (ID) and as such is also uniquely defined by the data field **ItemID**. The following three scenarios could occur for the export and import:

* If the field **ItemID** is neither exported along with the export of item fields nor imported later on, then new items will be created with available item IDs.
* If the data record **ItemID** is exported and later imported again, then changes will be made to the corresponding items.
* If item data is imported with item IDs that do not yet exist in plentymarkets, then new items will be created with these item IDs.

If the import procedure **Synchronisation** is selected in the data export settings, then the item data will be synchronised during the import.

[#20]
== The 1:n problem

The 1:n problem, i.e. one to n, occurs when several characteristics were defined for one item. The following characteristics can be allocated to an item multiple times in plentymarkets:

* **Price lines**

Every price set is uniquely defined by the field **PriceID**. If this ID is not specified, then a new price set will always be added and the existing prices will be deleted. If available, the existing price will be changed.

* **Categories**

An item can be available in multiple categories at the same time. However, if category data fields (CategoryLevel) were entered during the import, then all of the previous category links for this item will be deleted.

[IMPORTANT]
.Use the data format **Category** for new categories
====
It is not possible to use the data format **Item** for creating new categories. With the data format **Item**, you can only create new category links within the item. Use the data format <<data/export-import/data-formats/category#, Category>> instead to create new categories.
====

* **Item images**

This data format allows you to import external images with the help of URLs. Existing item images will be replaced in the process. If multiple item images are imported, then these item images have to be separated by a comma without spaces when they are entered. If you do not want to replace the existing images, then import the <<item/managing-items#680, images>> via FTP upload.
