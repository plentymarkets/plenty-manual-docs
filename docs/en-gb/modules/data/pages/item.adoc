This page describes the data fields and filters that are available when exporting item and variation data with the catalogue tool.
This page serves purely as a reference and it assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the xref:data:file-export.adoc#[catalogue tool].

[discrete]
==== Format type: Item (new)

The format type described on this page is found in the menu *Data » Catalogues*.
When creating a new catalogue, you’ll select the standard format from the upper drop-down list.
Then you can select the format type *Item (new)* from the middle drop-down list.

image::data:catalogue-item.png[]

[TIP]
.What’s a standard format?
====

* *_Definition_*:
A standard format is used to export specific data from your plentymarkets system.
Afterwards, you can revise the data and import it again.

* *_Example_*:
Imagine you want to update the prices and descriptions for several items at once.
You could export a CSV file with the item data saved in your system.
Afterwards, you could revise the file and import it again.

* *_Differentiation_*:
Note that standard formats only export data from your system.
They do not transmit this data to marketplaces.

== Data fields

This chapter lists all of the item data fields that can be exported with the catalogue tool.

:catalogue:

'''
[#20]
=== ASIN

[discrete]
==== Folder level

ASIN codes can be saved separately for every Amazon country platform.
The folders here correspond to the various Amazon country platforms, i.e. Amazon France, Amazon UK or Amazon Italy.
Open the folder for whichever country platform has an ASIN code that you want to export.

[TIP]
.What about the folder “Asin Default”?
====
This folder corresponds to the drop-down list *All* in the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: ASIN/ePID/MOIN*.
====

image::data:asin-all.png[]

[discrete]
==== Data field level

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Field |Explanation

| *ASIN Code*
|
include::item:partial$asin.adoc[]

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#260[Item » Edit item » [Open variation\] » Tab: Settings » Area: ASIN/ePID/MOIN]

|===

'''
[#30]
=== Moin

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Field |Explanation

| *Moin*
|
include::item:partial$moin.adoc[]

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#260[Item » Edit item » [Open variation\] » Tab: Settings » Area: ASIN/ePID/MOIN]

|===


'''
[#40]
=== Barcode

This folder lists the xref:item:barcodes.adoc#100[barcode types] that you’ve already configured in the menu *Setup » Item » Barcode*.
When you add a barcode type to the catalogue, xref:item:barcodes.adoc#300[the actual code] that was saved for this barcode type in the variation data record will be exported.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#250[Item » Edit item » [Open variation\] » Tab: Settings » Area: Barcode]

[discrete]
===== Example: Catalogue data field and variation data field

* *Barcode Type* = GTIN 13
* *Code* = 0123456789012

image::data:barcode-catalogue-variation.png[]

'''
[#50]
=== Default category

[TIP]
.Category vs. Default category
====

Variations can be linked to multiple categories:

* *_Category_*:
Imagine you sell a personalised bracelet.
You want the bracelet to appear in the category “Gifts” and in the category “Women’s accessories”.

* *_Default category_*:
Decide which one of these categories should be the variation’s default category.
The default category is the breadcrumb path displayed in the plentyShop.
If a variation appears in multiple categories, then the breadcrumb bar will always display the default category path.

* *_What is exported?_*:

** If you use “Item (new)” as a standard format, then it will only be possible to export information about the default category.
It is not currently possible to export information about other linked categories.
Possible workaround: Export the data with the tools xref:data:formatdesigner-item.adoc#1200[FormatDesigner] and xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#700[Elastic Export] instead.

** If you use “Item (new)” as a marketplace format (e.g. to transmit your product data to a sales platform), then you can export information about the default category and other linked categories.

====

image::data:category-defaultcategory.png[]

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Field |Explanation

| *Category ID*
|The ID of the category.

| *Category name*
|
include::item:partial$name.adoc[]

| *Category description*

| *Meta description*
|
include::item:partial$categories-meta-description.adoc[]

| *Meta keywords*
|
include::item:partial$categories-meta-keywords.adoc[]

| *Path*
|This data field corresponds to the category’s breadcrumbs path.
Enter a separator, i.e. decide which symbol or character should appear between the individual category levels.

*_Example_*: If you use the separator `-` then a category path could look like this: `shoes-women-boots-uggs`

| *Branch 1*; +
*Branch 2*; +
*Branch 3*; +
*Branch 4*; +
*Branch 5*; +
*Branch 6*
|You can save up to 6 category levels in the plentymarkets back end.
These data fields correspond to the individual levels of the category’s breadcrumbs path.

*_Example_*:
Your system includes the category: Shoes » Women » Boots » Uggs.

* Branch 1 = Shoes
* Branch 2 = Women
* Branch 3 = Boots
* Branch 4 = Uggs

=== Stock

[discrete]
==== Folder level

Stock levels can be managed for every warehouse separately.
The folders here correspond to the various xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#[warehouses] that you’ve already configured in the menu *Setup » Stock » Warehouse*.
Open the folder of whichever warehouse has stock information that you want to export.

[TIP]
.What about the folder “Total virtual stock”?
====
This folder corresponds to the sum of all your sales warehouses.
Example:

* Sales warehouse 1: Physical stock = 10
* Sales warehouse 2: Physical stock = 22
* Total virtual stock: Physical stock = 32
====

[discrete]
==== Data field level

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Field |Explanation

| *Physical stock*
|The quantity of items that are actually in the warehouse.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#95[Item » Edit item » [Open item\] » Tab: Stock » Column: Phy]

| *Net stock*
|The quantity of items that are available for sale.
The net stock is a subset of the physical stock.
Substract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#95[Item » Edit item » [Open item\] » Tab: Stock » Column: Net]

| *Reserved stock*
|The quantity of items that are reserved.
A variation will be reserved as soon as an order or a warranty is created.
The stock is reserved until either outgoing items are booked or until the order or the warranty is cancelled.
The reserved stock is part of the physical stock because the reserved stock is still present in the warehouse.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#95[Item » Edit item » [Open item\] » Tab: Stock » Column: RS]

| *Reorder level Delta*
|The difference to the reorder level.
The difference either tells you how many items still need to be sold in order to reach the reorder level or it tells you how many items you need to reorder to reach the reorder level.
This means if the difference is negative your stock is still above the reorder level.
If the difference is positive, your stock is below the reorder level.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items#95[Item » Edit item » [Open item\] » Tab: Stock » Column: RLΔ]

[#110]
=== Variation

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Field |Explanation

| *Variation ID*
|The ID of the variation.

*_Note_*: Every “Export Key” needs to be unique.
So if you use the item ID and the variation ID together, then make sure to give each “Export Key” a unique name.
xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#180[Further information].

[discrete]
==== Folder level

The folders here correspond to the various xref:item:properties.adoc#1200[property groups] that you’ve already created in the menu *Setup » Settings » Properties » Groups*.
Open a group’s folder and then add whichever properties have values that you want to export.

[discrete]
==== Data field level

The data fields here correspond to the various xref:item:properties.adoc#600[properties] that you’ve already created in the menu *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.
Add whichever properties have values that you want to export.
The value that’s saved for the property in the variation data record will be exported.
Specifically, that means:

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Property type |Explanation

| *None*; +
*Order properties*
|Since no value is entered into the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Properties*, no value is exported.
The line will be empty in the export file.

*_This means_*:
It is not currently possible to differentiate between variations that are linked to this type of property and variations that are not linked to this type of property.
This is a known issue and it will be fixed in the future.

| *Date*; +
*File*; +
*Whole number*; +
*Decimal number*; +
*Character string*; +
*Selection*

|The value saved in the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Properties » Area: Variation properties » Column: Value* will be exported.

| *HTML*; +
*Text*
|The text saved in the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Texts* will be exported.

*_Note_*:
Texts can be saved in multiple languages.
Use the drop-down list to specify which language version of the text you want to export.
If you want to export the text in multiple languages, then you will have to add the data field multiple times.

| *Multi selection*
|If you export a file in CSV or TXT format, then you’ll only see the word "Array" instead of the actual export values.

*_This means_*:
It’s not possible to tell which selection values were linked to the variation.
This is a known issue and it will be fixed in the future.

*_Possible workaround 1_*:
Would it be an option for you to download a JSON or XML file instead?
With these file types, you can see which selection values were linked to the variation.

. Click on icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] *Settings*.
. Scroll down to the section *Format settings*.
. Select JSON or XML from the drop-down list *Format*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings and download the file (material:file_download[]).

* *_Caution_*: If you want to revise the file and import it again.
Note that the xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool] only accepts the file types CSV and TXT.

*_Possible workaround 2_*:
Export the data with the tools xref:data:formatdesigner-item.adoc#1600[FormatDesigner] and xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#700[Elastic Export] instead.
|===

[TIP]
.Default name of the “Export Key”
====
By default, the export file’s column header is given the name: "property-GroupID-PropertyID".

* *_Example_*: the column header "property-3-17" means that the export data relates to the property with the ID 17.
And that this property is included in the group with the ID 3.

[discrete]
==== Folder level

Images can be saved for a specific xref:item:structure.adoc#[variation] or for the entire xref:item:structure.adoc#[item].

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Folder |Explanation

| *All images*
|The export file contains item images and variation images.

| *Item images*
|The export file contains item images.

| *Variation images*
|The export file contains variation images.

[discrete]
==== Data field level

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Field |Explanation

| *Image list*
|Enter a number into the text field *Maximum number of images*.
If you do not enter a number, then this field will be empty when it is exported.

If you export a file in CSV or TXT format, then you might only see the word "Array" instead of the actual export values.
This happens e.g. when exporting multiple images.
This is a known issue and it will be fixed in the future.

*_Possible workaround 1_*:
Would it be an option for you to download a JSON or XML file instead?
With these file types, you can see the actual export values.

. Click on icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] *Settings*.

Note that the xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool] only accepts the file types CSV and TXT.

*_Possible workaround 2_*:
Export the data with the tools xref:data:item-images.adoc#[FormatDesigner] and xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#700[Elastic Export] instead.

| *Single image*
|Enter a position number into the text field *Image position*.
This specifies which image should be exported.
If you do not enter a number, then the image with the lowest position number will be exported.

=== Shipping costs

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Field |Explanation

| *Net*
|The item’s shipping costs.
This data field gives you a precise, live-calculation of the shipping costs.
We recommend using this field over the field xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#110[Variation » Default shipping costs].

Which conditions should be used when calculating the shipping costs?
For example, which order referrer, sales price and country?
Choose your answers from the drop-down lists.

*_Example of use_*: You could use this field to compare an item’s shipping costs within the UK and abroad.
Add the field twice and decide which countries should be used when calculating the shipping costs.
Make sure that the “Export Keys” have unique names.

=== Sales price

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Field |Explanation

| *Sales price*
|Select a currency and one of the the xref:item:prices.adoc#[sales prices] that you’ve already configured in the menu *Setup » Item » Sales prices*.
This causes xref:item:managing-items.adoc#240[the actual monetary price], which is saved in the variation data record, to be exported.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:managing-items.adoc#240[Item » Edit item » [Open variation\] » Tab: Settings » Area: Sales prices]

*_Example_*: Catalogue data field and variation data field

* *Sales price* = B2B customers
* *Currency* = Euro
* *Monetary price* = 15.99

*_Note_*: Add the field multiple times if you want to export multiple sales prices.
In this case, make sure that the "Export Keys" have unique names.

| *Lowest price in the last 30 days*
|The value that is saved as the lowest price during the last 30 days.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: xref:item:prices.adoc#950[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Sales prices » Column: Lowest price during the last 30 days]

| *Lowest price automatically detected*
|Indicates whether the lowest price of the last 30 days was automatically calculated.

* Empty line = No, the lowest price was _not_ automatically calculated.
* `1` = Yes, the lowest price was automatically calculated.

*_Note_*: If you export the information in JSON format, then you will receive the values "true" and "false" rather than an empty line and "1".

'''
[#160]
=== Unit price

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Field |Explanation

| *Price*
|The item’s unit price.
The unit price tells you how much the item costs per pound, litre or other unit of measure.
It’s calculated based on the item’s xref:item:managing-items.adoc#270[content, unit] and xref:item:managing-items.adoc#240[price].

*_Additional step_*: Select the appropriate sales price from the drop-down list.

== Filters

This chapter lists all of the filters that you can use to limit which items are included in the export file.

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Filter |Explanation

| *Has a SKU*
|Limits the export to variations that have a SKU for a specific marketplace.

| *Item IDs*
|Limits the export to items with a specific ID.

*_Note_*: Use commas without spaces to separate multiple IDs.
Example: `11,12,13`

| *Variation is active*
|Limits the export to variations that are either xref:item:managing-items.adoc#intable-active[active or inactive].

|[#intable-market-or]*Visible for at least one market*
|Select one or more marketplaces from the drop-down list.
Limits the export to items that are xref:item:managing-items.adoc#350[available] for _at least one_ of these markets.

[.collapseBox]
.*This is an “or” filter*
--

*_Example_*: If you select the markets eBay, Amazon and Zalando, then the export file will include items that are available on eBay OR Amazon OR Zalando.

*_Differentiation_*:
There is also an “and” filter. xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#intable-market-and[Further information].

--

|[#intable-tags-and]*Has Tags*
|Select one or more tags from the drop-down list.
Limits the export to items that are linked to _all_ of the selected xref:item:flags.adoc#600[tags].

[.collapseBox]
.*This is an “and” filter*
--

*_Example_*: If you select the tags “Signed copy”, “Collector’s item” and “Antique”, then the export file will include items that are linked to the tag “Signed copy” AND “Collector’s item” AND “Antique”.

*_Differentiation_*:
There is also an “or” filter. xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#intable-tags-or[Further information].

--

|[#intable-selectionvalue-or]*Linked to at least one property selection value*
|Enter the IDs of one or more selection values into the text field.

[#180]
== FAQ

// tag::faq-export-key[]
[.collapseBox]
.*What does “Export Key” mean?*
--

The “Export Keys” are the names of the column headers, as they will appear in your export file.
Every “Export Key” needs to be unique.

* *_Negative example_*: You use the data fields xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#60[Item ID] and xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#110[Variation ID].
You give both “Export Keys” the name “id”.
As a result, the export file only includes one of the two IDs.
A column is missing in the export file.
* *_Positive example_*: You use the data fields xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#60[Item ID] and xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#110[Variation ID].
You give one “Export Key” the name “VariationID” and the other “ItemID”.

[.collapseBox]
.*What does “Comparative value” mean?*
--

When you add a data field, you’ll see the option “Comparative value”.
This option is accidentally displayed here.
It is not intended for standard formats, but rather for other use-cases.
This is a known issue and it will be fixed in the future.
Until then, simply leave the “Comparative value” option blank since it doesn’t affect the standard format.

[.collapseBox]
.*How do I export the file?*
--

. Click on material:file_download[] in the toolbar up top. +
→ The export will start and it runs in the background.
You can continue working during the export process.
. After a while (ca. 30-60 minutes), a message will appear in the notification centre (material:notifications_none[]).
. Click on material:link[] *Download* within the notification.

[.collapseBox]
.*I only see the folder “Default category”. Can I also export the other categories?*
--

Variations can be linked to multiple categories:

* *_Category_*:
Imagine you sell a personalised bracelet.
You want the bracelet to appear in the category “Gifts” and in the category “Women’s accessories”.

* *_Default category_*:
Decide which one of these categories should be the variation’s default category.
The default category is the breadcrumb path displayed in the plentyShop.
If a variation appears in multiple categories, then the breadcrumb bar will always display the default category path.

* *_What is exported?_*:

** If you use “Item (new)” as a standard format, then it will only be possible to export information about the default category.
It is not currently possible to export information about other linked categories.
Possible workaround: Export the data with the tools xref:data:formatdesigner-item.adoc#1200[FormatDesigner] and xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#700[Elastic Export] instead.

** If you use “Item (new)” as a marketplace format (e.g. to transmit your product data to a sales platform), then you can export information about the default category and other linked categories.

// tag::faq-missing-column[]
[.collapseBox]
.*My export file is missing a column. Why?*
--

You might have data fields with the same “Export Key”.
Every “Export Key” needs to be unique.

* *_Negative example_*: You use the data fields xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#60[Item ID] and xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#110[Variation ID].
You give both “Export Keys” the name “id”.
As a result, the export file only includes one of the two IDs.
A column is missing in the export file.
* *_Positive example_*: You use the data fields xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#60[Item ID] and xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#110[Variation ID].
You give one “Export Key” the name “VariationID” and the other “ItemID”.

image::data:catalogue-export-keys.png[]

--
// end::faq-missing-column[]

// tag::faq-array[]
[.collapseBox]
.*Only the word “Array” is exported. Why?*
--

If you export a file in CSV or TXT format, then you might only see the word "Array" instead of the actual export values.
This happens e.g. when exporting multiple images or when exporting multi-selection properties.
This is a known issue and it will be fixed in the future.

*_Possible workaround 1_*:
Would it be an option for you to download a JSON or XML file instead?
With these file types, you can see the actual export values.

. Click on icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] *Settings*.
. Scroll down to the section *Format settings*.
. Select JSON or XML from the drop-down list *Format*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings and download the file (material:file_download[]).

* *_Caution_*: If you want to revise the file and import it again.
Note that the xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool] only accepts the file types CSV and TXT.

*_Possible workaround 2_*:
Export the data with the tools xref:data:item.adoc#[FormatDesigner] and xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#700[Elastic Export] instead.
