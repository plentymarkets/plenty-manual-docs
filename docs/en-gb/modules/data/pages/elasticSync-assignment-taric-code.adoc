An import of the type *Assignment taric code* allows you to import data for the taric code table in the menu *Setup » Client » Settings » Taric code*. In order for the assignment of taric codes to variations and VAT rates to work in the system afterwards, taric codes have to be entered at the corresponding variations. To provide taric codes for variations via import, go to the xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#2300[import type Item].
