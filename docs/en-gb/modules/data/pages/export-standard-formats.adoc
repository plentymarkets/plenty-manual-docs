Use catalogue standard formats to export data from your plentymarkets system to a file. You can create export files in the formats CSV, JSON, TXT or XML. There are xref:data:catalogue-formats.adoc#[different standard format] for exporting data. Not all types of data can currently be exported using catalogues. Until standard formats are available for all types of data, you can continue using the xref:data:FormatDesigner.adoc#[Formatdesigner].

[#data-export]
== Selecting data for export

Now decide what plentymarkets data you want to export with this catalogue.

This is how the information in this chapter is structured:

* <<#add-fields, Adding data fields for export>>
* <<#delete-fields, Removing data fields from the export>>
* <<#filter-data, Filtering export data>>

[#add-fields]
=== Adding data fields to export

Now it’s time to decide which plentymarkets data field data fields you want to export from plentymarkets with this catalogue. To do so, add the data fields to the export as described below.

You can also use more complex export features:

* <<#optional-fallback, Export a different data field if the first data field is empty (Add fallback data field)>>
* <<#optional-own-value, Export the same value for every record (icon:pencil[role="blue"] *Own value*)>>
* <<#optional-combine, Combine several data fields>>
* <<#optional-recalculate, Recalculate numerical values during export (icon:calculate[set=material] *Formula*)>>
* <<#optional-change-order, Change the order of data fields>>

[.instruction]
Adding data field to the export:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Click on the catalogue. +
→ The view *Data fields* tab (icon:order_return_create_edit[set=plenty[) of the catalogue opens. +
→ The available plentymarkets data fields are listed in groups. In addition, the options *icon:pencil[role="black"] Own value* and *icon:calculate[set=material] Formula* are shown. +
. Expand a data field group to see the list of data fields in that group.
. Click on the plus icon next to the data field that you want to export. +
*_Tip:_* Alternatively, enter the name of the data field into the search field. Select the data field from the search results. +
→ The data field is added to the export. +
. Check if the export key suits your needs. +
  ** *_What is an export key?_* +
  The Export Key is the name of the column header that will be shown in your export file. Each export key can only be used once in this catalogue. Also, export keys cannot contain any spaces. +
  *_Important:_* If several data fields have the same export key, only one data field is exported.
. Add all data fields that you want to export.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=material]) the settings. +
→ The data fields are exported with this catalogue. +
*_Tip:_* Check the info boxes below this description to find out about more complex export options.

[#optional-fallback]
[.collapseBox]
._Optional:_ Export a different data field if the first data field is empty (Add fallback data field)
--

Fallback data fields are used like this:

* I want the first plentymarkets data field to be exported.
* If this data field is empty or invalid for a record, the first fallback data field is checked and the value of that fallback data field is exported instead.
* If the first fallback data field is also empty or invalid, the second fallback data field is checked and the value of that fallback data field is exported instead and so on.

[.instruction]
Adding fallback data fields:

* *_Initial situation:_* +
→ You added a data field to the export. For this data field, you want to specify an alternative in case the data field is empty or invalid for one or more records.

. Below the data fields, click on *+ Add fallback data field*. +
→ The editing mode opens.
. On the right, click on a group to expand the associated plentymarkets data fields. +
→ The plentymarkets data fields are shown.
. Click on the plus to the right of the plentymarkets data field you want to select. +
→ The plentymarkets data field is added as a fallback data field to the field on the right. +
→ The fallback data field is exported when the first data field does not exist or is empty.

*Note the following logic for fallback data fields:*

* Even if you assign one or more fallback data fields, the value of only one field is exported.
* For each record, the plentymarkets data fields are checked in the order in which you mapped them. This means that if the first data field does not provide a value, the first fallback data field is exported etc.
* *_Tip:_* You can also add *Own value* as a fallback data field.

The following GIF shows the standard format *Manufacturer*. The data field *Manufacturer > External name* is to be exported. However, if no external name is saved for one or more manufacturers, you want to export the *Internal name* instead.

image::data:gif-standardformats-fallback.gif[width=600]

[#optional-own-value]
[.collapseBox]
._Optional:_ Export the same value for every record (*Own value*)
--

The data field *Own value* is used like this:

* For a column of your export file, the same value is exported for all records of the catalogue.

[.instruction]
Exporting an own value:

. In the list of the data fields, click on *Own value*. +
→ The data field for an own value is added to the export.
. Check the export key. Own values are automatically assigned the export key *own-value*. As such, make sure that you adjust the export key, especially when you want to export more than one own value. +
*_Important:_* If several data fields have the same export key, only one data field is exported.
. Enter a value into the input field *Value*. +
→ This value is exported for all records.

The following GIF shows the standard format *Stocks*.

* You want the export file to include a column with your company name.

image::data:gif-standardformats-own-value.gif[width=600]

*_Result in the export file:_*

* Every exported record has a cell that contains your company name:

image::data:result-export-companyname.png[]

--

[#optional-combine]
[.collapseBox]
._Optional:_ Combining several data fields
--

When you combine data fields, the following logic is applied:

* The data fields are to be combined during the export.
* The values of the data fields are added to the same column of the export file.
* The character between the values is specified with the option *Separator*.

[.instruction]
Combining data fields:

* *_Initial situation:_* +
You already added a data field to the export. You want to combine this data field with another data field.

. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]). +
→ The editing mode opens.
. Click on the plus to the right of the data field you want to select. +
→ The data field is added to the right of the first data field.
. Click on *Confirm*. +
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. Select a separator from the drop-down list *Separator* or specify a custom separator.
. Click on *Save*.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the catalogue. +
→ The settings are saved. +
The content of these data fields is combined in the same column.

The following GIF shows the standard format *Manufacturer*.

* Instead of exporting the data fields *Street* and *House number* in two separate columns, these data fields are combined into one column.
* Select a space as the separator.

image::data:gif-standardformats-combination.gif[width=600]

*_Result in the export file:_*

image::data:result-export-street.png[]

[#optional-recalculate]
[.collapseBox]
._Optional:_ Recalculating numerical values during export (*Formula*)
--

Mathematical calculations allow you to change values automatically during the export.

* This function only works for data fields that contain numerical values.
* This function is new and has not been implemented for all formats yet.

[.instruction]
Recalculating numerical values during export:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Open the catalogue. +
→ The tab *Data fields* opens.
. In the list of data fields, click on the plus next to *Formula* (icon:calculate[set=material]). +
→ The field *Formula* is added to the view on the right.
. Click on the field *Formula*. +
→ The *Modify value* window opens.
. Select a decimal separator from the drop-down list.
. At the bottom right of the window, select a data field to add it to the calculation (icon:add[set=material]). +
*_Tip:_* Use the search function to find data fields quickly. +
→ The data field is added to the calculation.
. *_Optional:_* If the symbol icon:more_vert[set=material] is shown in the data field, select the correct assignment for the data field. +
*_Tip:_* A number tells you how many assignments are necessary for the data field.
    .. Click on the symbol icon:more_vert[set=material]. +
    .. In the window shown, select the assignments from the drop-down list.
    .. *Save* the settings.
. Enter numbers and mathematical operators with the on-screen calculator or the keyboard.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The entered formula is displayed in the overview. +
*_Tip:_* If a preview is available for the format, check the result by using the preview function (icon:preview[set=material]). +
→ The calculation will be carried out in the next export.
--

[#optional-change-order]
[.collapseBox]
._Optional:_ Changing the order of data fields
--

In the export file, the data fields are sorted in the same order as in the catalogue list. As such, the first column of a CSV file contains the data of the data field that is at the very top of the catalogue and so on.

To change the order of data in the export file, you can either move individual data fields or whole rows:

* To move a single data field:
  ** Point your mouse at the data field and drag and drop it to the new position.
* To move a whole column:
  ** Click on the symbol (icon:drag_indicator[set=material]) on the left side and drag and drop the row to the new position.
