[#import-preview]
== Show the first five rows of the import file

//tag::import-preview[]
Use the preview function to view the first five rows of the import file in a table. For example, this is useful if you are not quite sure how the file is structured.

[.instruction]
Showing a preview:

. Go to *Data » Import » [Open import]*.
. In the toolbar, click on *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]). +
→ In a new window *Preview*, the first five rows of the import file are shown in a table.
. Click outside the window to close it.
//end::import-preview[]

[#1400]
== Specifying matching fields

you have created an import. Now, open the import to continue with the settings. First, select the fields that should be used for matching data records. At the same time, you specify what happens if no existing record is found during the matching.

You can specify one, multiple or all matching fields. The matching fields are different for each import type.

[NOTE]
.Matching fields are optional
====
The matching fields are optional. However, if you do not select a matching field, the data in your file cannot be assigned to existing data in your system. So new data records are saved during each import. This can result in duplicate records in your system.
====

[.instruction]
Specifying matching fields:

. Go to *Data » Import » [Open import]*. +
→ The view *Settings* opens.
. Open the view *Matching*.
. Carry out the settings. These settings depend on the xref:page$import-types.adoc#[import typ] you selected.
. Save (material:save[]) the settings.

// TODO: Add example

[#1500]
== Mapping fields

Mappings allow you to specify which columns of your file are imported to which plentymarkets data fields. So without any mappings, no data can be imported. However, you do not need to map all sources of the import file. Only map the sources that you want to import.

[#understand-mappings]
=== Procedure

. Create the mapping. In other words, you specify in which plentymarkets data fields you want to save the data of the import file. (<<#create-mappings, How?>>)
. You map the sources of the import file to the plentymarkets data fields in which you want to save the data. (<<#do-mappings, How?>>) +
*_Tip:_* You can also manipulate the data from the import file in different ways during the import:
  * You specify your own value. By doing this, you will save the same value in a plentymarkets data field for all data records. (<<#own-value, How?>>)
  * You create a regular expression to reorder the data of a source. (<<#1520, How?>>)
  * You create a mathematical formula to recalculate numerical values of a source during the import.
  * You create your own mappings to replace the values of a source with other values during the import. (<<#1520a, How?>>)
. You activate the sources to be imported. (<<#1510, How?>>)

[.collapseBox]
.What is a source?
--
In CSV files, each column is a source. TXT files are structured differently. However, it makes it easier to also imagine the data they contain as columns.
--

[#8448399216]
=== Understanding the "Mapping" menu

* The column *Import data* is a list of all columns in the import file. There is one row per column.
* The column *Preview* shows the first 6 values of each column of the file.
* In the column *plentymarkets data fields*, select the plentymarkets data field to be filled with the data of the column.

You want to import a file into plentymarkets, but it's missing a few key pieces of information? No need to modify the file by hand! This video shows you how to use ElasticSync’s "Own Value" function to add missing information to your sync.

*_Note:_* The term *ElasticSync* is outdated and has been replaced by *import*.

[.instruction]
Mapping your own value:

. Navigate to the bottom of the view.
. Click on material:add[] *FIELD*. +
→ A new line is added. +
→ The source *Own value* is shown by default.
. In the field *Value*, enter the information that you want to save in the plentymarkets data field for all records of the import.
. Select the plentymarkets data field in which you want to save the value.
. Save (material:save[]) the mapping.

[#1520]
==== Custom mapping: Regular expressions

In order to consider a CSV or TXT file during the import as desired, the so-called RegEx function (Regular Expression) can be applied. This functionality manipulates data during the import based on commands. This means that no changes need to be made in the import file.

[IMPORTANT]
.Handle regular expressions with care!
====
Regular expressions are a powerful tool. However, they can also be tricky. As such, use regular expressions carefully and only if you are confident that they will work as expected. Some examples of external resources:

* link:http://php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php[http://php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php^]
* link:https://regexr.com/[https://regexr.com/^] +
  On this page, change the RegEx engine setting to *PCRE* first. To do so, use the drop-down list in the top right corner. In this drop-down list, the option *Javascript* is preselected.

[#formula]
==== Custom mapping: Mathematical calculations

In the mapping overview, select the option *Mathematical calculations* in order to recalculate numerical values during the import.

The following calculation methods are available:

* Addition (+++)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
* Plus a percentage (+)
* minus a percentage (-)

[.instruction]
Updating values using mathematical calculations:

. Go to *Data » Import » [Open import] » [Open mapping]*.

. In the drop-down list *Target*, select the plentymarkets data field that you want to fill.
. Save (material:save[]) the settings. +
→ The numerical values of the column are recalculated during the export. +
*_Important:_* The numbers in the import file stay the same.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Increase prices by 5%
--

*CSV columns*: [Select the column containing the price] +
*Operator*: positive % +
*Value*: 5 +
*plentymarkets data field*: [Select sales price]

*_Result:_* The prices in the specified column are increased by 5% during the import. This higher price is saved as the price in plentymarkets.
--

[#1520a]
==== Custom mapping: Own mapping

With the own assignment you can assign existing values of a CSV or TXT file to other values in the system. This enables to define, which value is supposed to be imported for which ID. In addition, for values in the CSV or TXT file that are not assigned, you can specify a default value. If no default value is specified, the original value is imported.

Own mappings are particularly helpful when internal plentymarkets ID are at play.
Examples are characteristic names, item flags, payment methods, countries/states, ISO codes, etc.
Take a look at the video for own mappings to get to know the principle.

[#1530]
=== Beispiel: Eigene Zuordnung verwenden

Let's assume that you want to use an import to activate shipping profiles in plentymarkets. Your file contains the item ID and the shipping service provider. In order to link an item to a shipping profile, the ID of the shipping profile is required. Because the name of the shipping profile cannot be used to activate the shipping profile.

*_Important:_* Note that the item and the shipping profile must already exist in plentymarkets for this to work.

You can find the shipping profile IDs in the menu *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping profiles*. In our example, the shipping profile DPD has the ID 7.

[[image-importing-data-shipping profile]]
.Shipping profile
image::data:shipping-profile.png[]

Our import file contains all the data that we need. However, it contains the name of the shipping profile instead of the ID:

[[image-importing-data-item-id]]
.Item ID
image::data:item-id.png[]

In our example, it would be very easy to manually replace "DPD" with "7". However, in real life, it is exactly its ability to process large volumes of data that make the import such a powerful tool. So, we create an own mapping that will make the change automatically during the import.

As the source for the import data, we select the value *Own assignment*:

[[image-importing-data-mapping]]
.Own assignment
image::data:own-mapping.png[]

As the *Type*, we select the column of the import file that contains the data that we want to manipulate. In our example, this is the column *Shipping profile*:

[[image-importing-data-column]]
.Select the file format of the import file
image::data:type.png[]

Now we get to the cool part: We are going to decide which value in the import file is going to be changed into which value. In our example, we want to change "DPD" to "7". Remember, this is the ID of this shipping profile in plentymarkets.
Afterwards, carry out the import. The shipping profile is linked.

=== Activating sources of a mapping for the import

Now decide which information for your import file you want to import into plentymarkets. Because only active sources are exported.

*_Example:_* You received a CSV file with product data from a manufacturer. For now, you only want to import the purchase price (PP) and check the rest of the data later. Instead of deleting all the columns you do not need from the file, you only activate the import for the source/column of the file that contains the purchase price. Nifty, right?

[.instruction]
Activating sources for the import:



[tabs]
====
Activating a source for import::
+
--
. Go to *Data » Import » [Open import] » [Open mapping]*.
. To the left of the source, click on the toggle button *Activate row*. +
* material:toggle_off[role="darkGrey"] = The source is inactive. The source is ignored during the export. +
* material:toggle_on[role="blue"] = The source is active. During the import, the data of this source is imported.
. Save (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.
--

Activating one or several sources for import::
+
--

. Go to *Data » Import » [Open import] » [Open mapping]*.
. To the very left, place a checkmark for all sources that you want to include in the import. +
*_Tip:_* Click on the check box at the very top to place a checkmark for all sources of the mapping at once.
. In the toolbar at the top, click on *Activate all* (icon:power-off[role="darkPurple"]). +
→ All selected sources are activated. +
*_Tip:_* Correspondingly, you can use *Deactivate all* (icon:power-off[role="darkPurple"]) to deactivate several or all sources at the same time.
. Save (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

* material:toggle_off[role="darkGrey"] = The mapping is inactive. During the import, the settings of this mapping are not applied. +
* material:toggle_on[role="blue"] = The mapping is active. During the import, the settings of this mapping are applied. +
*_Important:_* If more than one mapping is active, the mapping with the lowest position is imported first. All other active mappings are also imported in ascending order based on the position.

[#1611]
== *_Optional:_* Filtering import data

You can use filters to limit the data to be imported. To view the filters, open the view *Mapping*.

[.instruction]
Adding a filter:

== Replacing import files of manual imports

You created an import with the source *Manual upload*. You want this import to manually import a file again and again. This file is always structured in the same way. If the structure of the file's columns is still the same, you can upload the latest file directly in the import overview.

[.instruction]
Replacing import files of manual imports:

. Save the file on your computer.
. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Navigate to the import.
. In the *File name* column, click on the button *Upload file* (material:upload[]). +
→ The file directory is shown.
. Click on the file. +
→ The file is uploaded. +
*_Important:_* The mappings are deleted if the column structure of the file has changed after all. So make sure to check that the import settings are still correct.

[#1625]
== Viewing success and error messages of imports

== Tracking the status of imports

Go to *Data » Data import » Status* to check the status of your import processes. This shows which imports started and are complete. A progress bar visualises how the import process is going. In addition, you can check if any errors occurred and if all rows of data of the file were imported.

[#1710]
=== Processing jobs in the queue

//TODO: Move!

The queue enables the import of large amounts of data. Before being imported, the import file is broken down into packages. Each package is a job. A job consists of 750 lines of a CSV or TXT file. However, import files with less than 750 lines also make a job. Whenever an import is started, the file is split up into the respective jobs and is put into the queue. In the queue, new jobs are permanently retrieved and the imports are processed. There are two different statuses. The status *Open jobs* means that there are jobs in the queue waiting to be processed. *Completed jobs* on the contrary have already been processed and the data have been imported.

=== Restoring older/deleted import settings

Did you delete an import by mistake? Or somebody made changes to a well configured import that need to be reverted? You can do both using the backup functionality.

*_Important:_*

* These settings reset the imports to an earlier state. You _cannot reset data imported into the system_ doing this. That's possible too, xref:data:backup.adoc#[but in a different way].
* Backups are only created once a day during the night. When you import a backup, the data is reset to this state.
* All imports are reset. As such, you cannot reset only one import. +
*_Example:_* Somebody changed the settings for an item data import by mistake. However, an import for coupons was also created on the same day. When you run the backup of last night, both imports are reset to the state they were in last night. The import for item data is repaired. However, the import for coupons is deleted because it did not yet exist at the time the backup was created. The solution? Export the import settings of any imports that were created or updated since the last update. After the backup, you can then import these into your system.

[.instruction]
Restoring backups of imports:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Hosting » Backup*. +
→ The backup overview opens.
. In the line of the backup that you want to import, click on *Restore backup* (material:open_in_browser[]) on the right. +
→ The window *Import backup* is shown.
. For the setting *Import backup*, select the option *Partially import data base*.
. Activate the option *ElasticSync*. +
*_Tip:_* The import tool used to be called *ElasticSync*. That is why this option still has this name.
. Click on *Restore backup*. +
→ All imports are reset to the state they were in at the time the backup was created. +
→ There is no going back!


[#1630]
