:description: Find out how to import data in plentymarkets using the import tool.
:id: 6Z40YCT
:author: team-plenty-channel

This manual page describes how to import data using the import tool. Importing data is recommended if you want to add new items, customer data or stock etc. to your plentymarkets system and you already have this data available in digital format. The import tool allows to carry out data imports by creating imports. You can import your data manually or automatically.

== Importing data with assistants

You want to import contact or item data and wonder what is the fastest way to do this in your plentymarkets system? In this case, use the corresponding assistants that will allow you to create an import template which you can fill with your data. The assistants will guide you step by step through all necessary settings and you can determine which data you want to import. Afterwards, you can use another assistant to directly upload the filled import template and carry out the import.

[#1800]
=== Completing the Contact data import assistant

If you want to import contact data, you can either use the import tool or the Contact data import assistant. This assistant will help you to create an import template tailored to your needs. Afterwards, you can download it and fill in your data.

You can find the Contact data import assistant in the menu under *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup*. With this assistant, you carry out the following settings:

* You select the name for the import that should be displayed in the system later on.
* You select which contact data, address data and company data you want to import.
* You select which contacts and contact options you want to import.
* You select which addresses you want to import.
* You can download the import template as CSV file. Note that you must not change the first 3 lines.

If you now want to carry out the import, you can use the <<Upload data assistant>>. Alternatively, you can go to the *Data » Import* menu and upload the import file in the respective import.

[#1900]
=== Completing the Item import assistant

If you want to import item data, you can either use the import tool or the Item import assistant. This assistant will help you to create an import template tailored to your needs. Afterwards, you can download it and fill in your data.

You can find the Item import assistant in the menu under *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup*. With this assistant, you carry out the following settings:

* You select the name for the import that should be displayed in the system later on.
* You select which item data you want to import.
* You select which sales prices you want to import and determine the formatting.
* You can download the import template as CSV file. Note that you must not change the first 3 lines.

If you now want to carry out the import, you can use the <<Upload data assistant>>. Alternatively, you can go to the *Data » Import* menu and upload the import file in the respective import.

[#1200]
=== Completing the Upload data assistant

You can use the Upload data assistant to upload an import template containing your data and to directly carry out the import.

You can find the Upload data assistant in the menu under *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup*. With this assistant, you carry out the following settings:

* You upload the import template containing your data. +
*_Note_*: If you do not have an import template yet, use the respective import assistant to create one.
* You carry out the import. Here you can determine whether you want to directly carry out the import by finalising the assistant. Alternatively, you can start the import in the *Data » Import* menu.

Afterwards, you can see the import that you created with the assistant in the overview of the *Data » Import* menu. A matching does not exist here, as these are new data. In the *Mapping* tab of the import, all fields of your CSV file have already been mapped automatically to the plentymarkets data fields.

[#1210]
== Creating an import

The steps for creating and carrying out imports are identical for all import types. As such, the steps described in the following apply to all import types.

Go to **Data » Import** to create, edit and manage imports. Here, you can see an overview of all imports. With an import, you can assign the data of a file that is accessible via FTP or HTTPS to the data in plentymarkets and import them. When creating an import, you save information about the data source. Furthermore, it is important that you determine data for the matching and that you assign which data of your file corresponds to the data in plentymarkets. Use the matching to set what data is to be used to try to identify, if a data record already exists or not. Use the mapping to set which column in your file corresponds to which data field in plentymarkets. In the end, set an import interval. Proceed as described below to create an import.

[NOTE]
.Set the import interval in the end to avoid that an import is carried out too early
====
It is recommended to set the import interval in the end. By doing so, you avoid that an import is already carried out while you still carry out matching and mapping settings.
====

[.instruction]
Creating an import:

. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Click on *Add import* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +

== Setting the import options

The import options can be found in the *Matching* area. They apply both for the matching and for the mapping.

Before we get to the specific settings of the import options you now have the opportunity to learn more about the data import by watching the following videos.
As already mentioned, data can be imported manually or automatically. If you are new to plentymarkets and you want to manually import your data one time, watch this video and learn how to initially transfer product or customer data into your system. +
*_Note:_* The term *ElasticSync* is outdated and has been replaced by *import*.

.Manually import you data one time
video::321227231[vimeo]

This video shows you how to instruct plentymarkets to automatically import new files and archive old ones.

|Import option |Explanation

| *Select an import option*
a|

* *Import new data, update existing* = If data can be found by means of the matching fields, a new data record, e.g. a new item or a new order, is added. At the same time, existing data is updated.
* *Only update existing data* = Existing data is updated. If no data can be found by means of the matching fields, the data record is not imported.
* *Only import new data* = Only new data records are imported, i.e. any data for which no matching data is found based on the synchronisation fields.

| *Decimal number*
a| Select *German spelling* or *English spelling*.

* *German spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a comma and a full stop serves as thousands separator.
* *English spelling* = Decimal numbers are separated by a full stop and a comma serves as thousands separator.

| *Date format*
|Enter the date format. If the date in the file corresponds to the standard format Y-m-d H:i:s, it is not necessary to enter another format. Other formats, however, have to be entered here. All link:http://php.net/manual/de/function.date.php[php-compliant date formats^] are allowed.

|====

[#1400]
== Setting the matching

After creating an import, open it to carry out further settings. First, select the fields that should be used for matching the data. Determine what should happen if no existing data can be found during the matching process.

[NOTE]
.Matching is optional
====
Matching fields are optional settings. If you do not select a matching field, the data in your file cannot be assigned to existing data in your system. You can determine one, multiple or all matching fields. The displayed matching fields are different for each import type.
====

[.instruction]
Setting the matching:

. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Click on the import in the import overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#1500]
== Creating a mapping

With a mapping, you specify which column of your file corresponds to which data field in your system. Without this mapping, no data can be imported. You can create new mappings in the mapping tab. A position is automatically assigned to each new mapping and can be adjusted in the settings tab if necessary.

[.instruction]
Creating a mapping:

. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Click on an import. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Mapping* tab.
. Click on *Add mapping* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ A new window opens.
. Enter a name for the mapping.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The mapping opens. → The available mapping fields differ according to the import type.
. Select the data fields for the mapping by placing a checkmark in the fields. +
→ The selected data fields are added to the mapping.
. Select a column from your file for each data field or select the option *Own value*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

You want to import a file into plentymarkets, but it's missing a few key pieces of information? No need to modify the file by hand! This video shows you how to use the import tool's "Own Value" function to add missing information to your import. +
*_Note:_* The term *ElasticSync* is outdated and has been replaced by *import*.

.Use the Own value to add missing information to your file
video::329761403[vimeo]

[NOTE]
.Own value
====
The option *Own value* allows to import a fix value for the data field. This fixed value is thus identical for each data record that is imported via this import.
====

[NOTE]
.Mathematical calculations
====
In the mapping overview, select the option *Mathematical calculations* in order to adjust values in a CSV or TXT file during the import. The options addition (+++), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) and the adaptation of percentages (+)/(-) are available. The value that is being adapted in the CSV or TXT column has to be a number.
====

[#1510]
=== Activating lines of a mapping for the import

In the *Mapping* section, you can activate (and also deactivate) all selected lines for the import with just one click. Alternatively, you can decide individually for each line whether you want it to be active or inactive, thus, whether it should be considered in the import or not.

[.instruction]
Activating lines for the import:

. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Click on an import. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Mapping* tab.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. On the left, select all lines you want to consider in the import.
. At the top, click on *Activate all* (icon:power-off[role="green"]). By clicking on *Deactivate all* (icon:power-off[role="red"]), you can deactivate all selected lines again.
. Alternatively, click on *Activate row* (icon:toggle-off[role="red"]) on the right to activate lines for the import individually.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[NOTE]
.View of the mapping
====
On the left side of the mapping you can see the import data of the CSV or TXT file that have to be mapped on the plentymarkets page. The plentymarkets data fields are shown on the right. The preview (icon:eye[role="blue"]) displays the first 6 values of the file.
====

[TIP]
.Editing position and name
====
By clicking on *Settings* (icon:cog[role="black"]) in the mapping, the fields *Name* and *Position* become visible and can be edited.
====

[#1515]
=== Activating/deactivating mappings

If you manage several mappings in the same import, you can deactivate or activate specific mappings of the import in the mapping overview by clicking on the toggle button in the column *Active/Inactive*. New mappings are active by default.

[#1520]
=== Replacing values with the RegEx function

In order to consider a CSV or TXT file during the import as desired, the so-called RegEx function (Regular Expression) can be applied. Thanks to this function, data is manipulated during the import by using commands, so that the CSV or TXT file does not need to be changed anymore. Watch this video to learn more about the RegEx function. +
*_Note:_* The term *ElasticSync* is outdated and has been replaced by *import*.

.Modify your data with the RegEx function
video::329761682[vimeo]

The following two examples will give an overview of the process.

*Example 1*: +
*Input*: “24.12.2017” +
*Search pattern*: /^(\\d+).(\\d+).(\\d+)$/ +
*Replace pattern*: $3﹣$2﹣$1 +
*Result*: “2017-12-24”

*Example 2*: +
*Input*: “Doe, John” +
*Search pattern*: /^(\\w+), (\\w+)$/ ++), (\\w+)$/ +
*Replace pattern*: $2 $1 + +
*Result*: “John Doe” +

*Explanation of the examples*: +
Right at the beginning, there is the input. In a first step, the pattern to be searched for is inserted as search pattern. Afterwards, it is changed accordingly in the replace pattern, so that it is output during the import as required. Finally, the result is output as desired and will be considered in the CSV or TXT file.

[.instruction]
Replacing values:

. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Click on an import. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Mapping* tab.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. In the field *Source*, select the value *Regular expression*. +
→ The options for *Regular expression* open.
. In the field *Value*, enter the column name of the CSV or TXT file (e.g. Package number, Order ID etc.).
. In the field *Search*, enter the Search pattern.
. In the field *Replace*, enter the Replace pattern.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The data fields are updated.

[NOTE]
.Info about RegEx
====
For further information on RegEx see link:http://php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php[this^] page or have a look link:https://regexr.com/[here^].
On the latter page, the RegEx engine setting has to be changed to PCRE. This can be done in the drop-down menu on the top right where Javascript is preset.
====

[#1520]
=== Own assignment

With the own assignment you can assign existing values of a CSV or TXT file to other values in the system. This enables to define, which value is supposed to be imported for which ID. In addition, for values in the CSV or TXT file that are not assigned, you can specify a default value. If no default value is specified, the original value is imported.

[.instruction]
Defining an own assignment:

. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Click on an import. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Mapping* tab.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. In the drop-down menu of the *Source* field, select the option *Own assignment*.
. Fill in the fields. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-own-assignment>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-own-assignment]]
.Own assignment
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| *Field* | *Setting*

| *Type*
|Name of the CSV or TXT column (e.g. Delivery country)

| *Default value*
|Value, in case no assignment was found (e.g. 1)

| *From*
|Original value in the CSV or TXT file (e.g. DE for Germany)

| *To*
|Value, to which the original value shall be mapped (e.g. 1 for DE, 10 for GB etc.)
|====

[#1530]
=== Manipulating an import file via the own assignment

In the following section we will demonstrate the usage of the own assignment shown by the example of *Activating a shipping profile*. +
To do so, an item/a variation as well as a shipping profile has to exist. The following video gives you an introduction on how the Own assignment works. +
*_Note:_* The term *ElasticSync* is outdated and has been replaced by *import*.

.Use the Own assignment to trade one piece of information for another
video::329761532[vimeo]

[[image-importing-data]]
.Shipping profile
image::data:en-elasticsync-shipping-profile.png[]

In order to link an item/a variation to a shipping profile, the ID is required. Just the name of the shipping profile shown in the import file is not sufficient to create a link.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Item ID
image::data:en-elasticsync-item-id.png[]

Use the own assignment in the import tool, which manipulates the data during the import. As source for the import data, select the value *Own assignment*.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Own assignment
image::data:en-elasticsync-own-assignment.png[]

For *type*, select the column from the import file. In this case, it is the column *Shipping profile*.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Select the file format of the import file
image::data:en-elasticsync-type.png[]

Determine which value in the import file shall be changed to which value in order to successfully carry out the import. In this case, DPD shall be changed to the ID of the shipping profile (here ID 7). You can also do this for several shipping profiles by adding further own assignments.
Afterwards, carry out the import. The shipping profile is linked.

[[image-importing-data]]
.Determining a value
image::data:en-elasticsync-determine-value.png[]

The own assignment can be used for many other cases. This applies in particular where internal IDs of plentymarkets play a role (e.g. characteristic names, item flags, payment methods, country ISO codes etc.).

[#1600]
== Filtering import data

You can use filters to limit the imported data. You find the filters in the *Mapping* area.

[NOTE]
.Multiple filters are linked with an AND condition
====
If you use multiple filters, only those data records that apply to all filters are imported. Thus, the filters are linked with an AND condition.
====

[.instruction]
Adding a filter:

. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Click on the import in the import overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Mapping* tab.
. Click on a mapping. +
→ The mapping opens.
. Click on *Filter* (icon:filter[role="yellow"]) in the toolbar.
. Select the column from your file that you want to filter.
. Select an operator.
. Enter a value.
. Click on *Add filter* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The filter is saved.
. Add additional filters as necessary. +
→ Only data that meets all filter criteria is imported.


//[#1620]
//== Report of imports

//A report is available in the overview of an import. This report shows all imported lines including the success and error messages, which can be opened by clicking on the *Message* column. Use the filter in order to retrieve specific import data.

[#1605]
== Error messages and troubleshooting in the import tool

The import tool offers you various possibilities to identify incorrect imports beforehand and to perform troubleshooting. Thus, you can for example check imports for errors before running them or you can view a log of concrete error messages once the import has been carried out. The different possibilities are listed below.
[#1610]
=== Checking imports for errors before the run

With the validation, imports can already be checked for errors before the run to guarantee a smooth import.

[.instruction]
Checking imports for errors before the run:

. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Click on an import. +
→ The settings open.
. In the settings, matching or mapping tab, click on *Validation* (icon:bug[role="yellow"]). +
→ A window opens and shows a table with the respective error messages.
. In case an error occurred and you need help in the forum, click on *Copy to clipboard* (icon:clone[role="yellow"]) and paste the information in the forum.

[#1615]
=== Testing the import and importing sample data

In the import overview you can test (icon:flask[role="yellow"]) and run (icon:play-circle[role="grey"]) imports. Testing allows you to quickly know whether your file can be imported correctly.

[NOTE]
.Testing the import
====
Note that stock is already being imported when testing an import. If you select *Test import* (icon:flask[role="yellow"]), only the first 10 lines of the import file are imported.
====

[#1620]
=== Viewing the log of a completed import

A log listing errors that may have occurred is automatically created for each completed import.

[.instruction]

[#1630]
== Copying imports

You can copy one import or multiple imports at the same time. That way, you can use imports that you have already configured in order to quickly create a new import.

[.instruction]
Copying imports:

. Go to *Data » Import*. +
→ The import overview opens.
. Select one or multiple imports.
. Click on *Copy import*. +
→ The import is copied. *(copy)* is added behind a copied import.

[#1640]
== Carrying out imports and exports

You can import and export imports. Furthermore, you can save imports locally and import them from other users.

== Processing jobs in the queue

The queue enables the import of large amounts of data. Before being imported, the import file is broken down into packages and processed in so-called jobs. A job consists of 750 lines of a CSV or TXT file. However, import files with less than 750 lines also make a job. Whenever an import is started, the file is split up into the respective jobs and is put into the queue. In the queue, new jobs are permanently retrieved and the imports are processed. There are two different statuses. The status *Open jobs* means that there are jobs in the queue waiting to be processed. *Completed* jobs on the contrary have already been processed and the data have been imported.
