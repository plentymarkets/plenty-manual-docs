:marketplace-export:

Use the marketplace formats of the catalogue to export variation data and stock data to many markets and price portals.
plentymarkets is working on moving all markets to catalogue formats.

On this page, find out how to export variation data to markets using catalogues. Only the general workflow is explained.

When you are ready to set up catalogues for individual markets, head over to the manual pages of the individual xref:markets:markets.adoc#[markets] to find out how you create and structure the catalogues.

[#market-formats]
== What are catalogues with marketplace formats?

Every market structures product data differently. Often, different product information is even exported to the same market for different product categories: Your product data is different for shoes than for cat food. For shoes, you specify for example the shoe size and the material. For cat food, you will specify unit price information, the list of ingredients, the cats the food is most suited for, etc.

Catalogues with marketplace formats allow you to tailor your item information exactly to the needs of the market. Because here, you assign a suitable plentymarkets data field to each of the data fields of the market. When your variation data is exported to the market, the market’s data fields are then filled with the correct plentymarkets data.

* A marketplace format contains a matrix of the data fields that a market can process. As such, marketplace formats tell you what data can be exported to the market. The asterisks also help you to see straight away which data is obligatory and which is option.

* One market can offer several marketplace formats. For example, there might be different formats for different product categories (pet food, food, non-food, etc.) or for different languages. However, for some market you export all item data in a single catalogue. An example for this is Etsy.

*_What are the advantages of these catalogues?_*

* Every format is based on the data structure of a specific market. As such, you know exactly which variation data is necessary to sell your products on the market.
* You choose for each market and sometimes even for each market category which variation data is going to be published on the market. For example, you can use properties to export different variation names and descriptions to different markets.
* You can easily copy and adjust well configured catalogues.

*_Let’s be honest: Are there any disadvantages?_*

It really depends. The catalogues give you maximum flexibility. You can map data fields any way you like. However, that also means that mappings are not checked on whether or not they make any sense. As an example, the system will not prevent you from mapping the variation ID as the price. You might only notice such a mistake when your variations are either not exported to the market or when your t-shirts suddenly cost a few thousand bucks. However, this is only a disadvantage if you don’t work carefully. The more familiar you are with the catalogues, the easier it will be for you to map the data fields. You can always copy and adjust well configured catalogues. That also makes your work easier.

[#marketplace-fields]
=== Marketplace data field

[discrete]
===== Marketplace data fields, I barely know you

Marketplace data fields are the fields for which you can export data to the market. Because every market structures and processes item data differently, each market also has different marketplace data fields.

*_What you should know about marketplace data fields:_*

* The marketplace data fields are shown on the left side of the catalogue.
* In the catalogue, mandatory fields are flagged with an asterisk. You definitely need to map plentymarkets data fields for these mandatory fields. In addition, values must be saved for these data fields for each variation. Otherwise, the variation will not be exported to the market.
* All other data fields are optional but will likely increase your sales performance. If no data is saved for one or more of these optional fields is saved for a variation, the variation is still exported to the market.
* The best information about marketplace data fields is provided by the market itself. Read the market’s documentation to find out exactly what data is expected. When in doubt, ask your contact person at the market. If everything else fails, you might want to lean on aunt G**gle: Try searching for the name of the marketplace in combination with “data feed”, “data specification” or just enter the name of the marketplace data field and see what happens.

[#plentymarkets-fields]
=== plentymarkets data fields

The plentymarkets data fields in the catalogue are the same settings as the ones you can select for your items and variations in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation]*. In addition to these settings, you can also select the properties that are saved in your plentymarkets system.

*_What you should know about plentymarkets data fields:_*

* A market expects product data that cannot be saved for a variation directly? Create a property. Then, link this property with your variations. Save product data as the values for this property.
* Check out the manual page for the standard format xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#[Item (new)] to find out which data is exported with which plentymarkets data fields.
* You can map a fallback data field in addition to a plentymarkets data field. All plentymarkets data field are again available as fallback data fields. The difference is that the content of the fallback data field is only exported if the first mapped plentymarkets data field does not return a value.


[#mappings]
== Which mappings are available?

In this chapter, we give you the lowdown of the available mappings.

This information is structured like this:

* <<#mappings-what-is, What does “mapping” mean?>>
* <<#one-to-one, Simple 1:1 mappings>>
* <<#one-to-one-complex, Complex 1:1 mappings>>
* <<#one-to-one-fallback, 1:1 mappings with fallback data fields>>
* <<#one-to-n, 1:n mappings>>
* <<#own-value, Own value mappings>>
* <<#formula, Recalculating numerical values (Formula)>>

[#mappings-what-is]
=== What does “mapping” mean?

Mapping means that you link a marketplace data field with a plentymarkets data field.
Slightly simplified and just to get you started: You do that by clicking on *Add data field* next to the marketplace data field.

However, what happens when you map these fields?

* *For this one marketplace data field, I want to export the data to the market that is saved in this plentymarkets data field for the variation.*

*_Example:_*

You map the plentymarkets data field *Item text » Name 1* to the marketplace data field *Name*:

image::data:productname-example-1.png[]

As such, the name that is saved in the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings* for the setting *Name 1* is exported to the market for all variations.

For the variation you can see in the screenshot below, that means that the name *Design armchair Black&White* is exported to the market.

[#one-to-one]
=== Simple 1:1 mappings

[discrete]
===== Map 1 marketplace data field to the plentymarkets data field

In a 1:1 mapping, you map a plentymarkets data field to the marketplace data field. If no suitable setting exists in plentymarkets, you can map a property instead.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to fill this marketplace data field with the data from this plentymarkets setting.
* If the plentymarkets data field does not return a value, no value is exported for this variation.

[#one-to-one-complex]
=== Complex 1:1 mappings

[discrete]
===== Map the value of one marketplace data field to the value of 1 plentymarkets data field

[#one-to-one-fallback]
=== 1:1 mappings with fallback data fields

[discrete]
===== Map 1 marketplace data field to the plentymarkets data field and specify an alternative

You specify:

* I want to fill this marketplace data field with the data from this plentymarkets setting.
* If the plentymarkets data field does not return a value for a variation, the fallback data field is checked and the value of that fallback data field is exported instead.

All plentymarkets data field are available as fallback data fields. However, the content of the fallback data field is only exported if the first mapped plentymarkets data field does not return a value.

*_Workflow for fallback data fields:_*

* During the export, the mapped plentymarkets data field of each variation is checked for content.
* If data is saved for a variation for that plentymarkets data field, then this data is exported.
* If the plentymarkets data field does not return any data, the system jumps to the first fallback data field and checks if this returns any data. +
** *_Example 1:_* You mapped *Name 3* as the first plentymarkets data field. However, in the variation date a name is only saved in the field *Name 1*. The field *Name 3* is empty. +
** *_Example 2:_* You mapped a property as the first plentymarkets data field. However, this property is not linked to the variation.
* If the fallback data field also does not contain data for the variation, the second fallback data field is checked and so on.
* If no data is found for a marketplace data field for a variation, what happens next depends on whether or not the data field is mandatory or not. If so, the variation is not exported. If not, the variation is exported. The variation is exported but the marketplace data field is not filled on the market.

[#one-to-n]
=== 1:n mappings

[discrete]
===== Map SEVERAL plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data field

In a 1:n mapping, you map several plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data field. You can link these settings with a separator.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to combine these plentymarkets data fields during export so that the marketplace data field is filled with the data of these two or more plentymarkets settings.

// TODO: limango as an example when the plugin is public.

[#own-value]
=== Own value mappings

[discrete]
===== Map the same value for all variations to the marketplace data field

You are sure that you want to export the same value for all variations of a catalogue for a marketplace data field? Then specify an own value. This own value is then exported for all variations.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to export the value that I entered in the field *Own value* for _all_ variations of this catalogue.

*_Example:_*

You want to export diameter information for some of your variations. The diameter is saved in centimetres for all your variations. Instead of creating a property for the unit and linking this property to every variations, you can enter the own value `cm`.

[#formula]
=== Recalculating numerical values (Formula)

[discrete]
===== You save a mathematical formula. This formula is applied to numerical values during the export.

Mathematical calculations allow you to change numerical values automatically during the export.

* This function is new and has not been implemented for all marketplace formats yet.
* This function only works for data fields that contain numerical values.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want the numerical value of a plentymarkets data field to be recalculated during the export. Basic arithmetic operations are available for the formulas.

////
*_Example:_*

You want to set up a stock buffer for the market. So a specific quantity is substracted from the stock of each variation during the export. In the catalogue, create the following formula:

[#file-export]
== _Optional:_ File export (no market export)

Catalogues with marketplace formats are automatically exported to markets if all your settings are correct. That means you can ignore the catalogue settings for *Format settings*, *Export settings* and *Download settings*.

However, you can also export a file that contains the data that is also exported to the market.

[#XjKI8jqJKa]
=== One-time catalogue export to a file

Use these instructions to create a one-time export of the catalogue data. The catalogue data is *_not_* exported to the market.

include::partial$catalogue-manual-download.adoc[tag=single-export]


[#X9NucM8q50]
=== Regular catalogue export to a file

Use these instructions to save the variation data of the catalogue regularly to a specified storage location. It is also up to you to decide what “regularly” means. The catalogue data is *_not_* exported to the market.

[.instruction]
Setting up regular file exports:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Click on the catalogue. +
→ The catalogue opens.
. Click on the *Settings* tab (icon:cog[]) on the left. +
→ The different settings options are shown.
. Carry out the settings. Note <<#table-file-export>>.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings. +
→ The catalogue data is exported to a file in the specified intervals. +
→ The file is saved at the specified storage location.
