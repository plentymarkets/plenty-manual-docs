:marketplace-export:

Catalogues are used to prepare data for export. For exporting variation data to markets and price search engines, you use catalogues with marketplace formats.

On this page, find out how to use catalogues to export variation data to markets. Only the general workflow is explained.
More detailed information about how you create an structure a catalogue can be found on the manual pages of the individual markets.

plentymarkets is working on moving all markets to catalogue formats. At the moment, you can export item data to the following markets using catalogues:

* OTTO Market
* Etsy
* Voelkner
* Conrad
* Some Amazon flatfiles
* Plugins by third parties

TIP: This page is new and we always want to improve. Couldn’t find what you are looking for or do you think something could be explained better? Then let us know by using the feedback function. The more details you provide, the more we can improve this page.

[#menu-screenshot]
== First introduction: menu structure

The catalogue menu is the same for all marketplace formats:

image::markets:catalogue-menu-colours.png[]
__Menu structure of a catalogue with marketplace format__

[cols="1,3a"]
|====

| *Navigation*
| When you open a catalogue, the view *Mapping* is shown by default. Use the navigation to switch to other views of the catalogue.

[cols="1,3a"]
!===

! icon:search[role="darkGrey"] *Overview*
! Go back to the catalogue overview, that is to the list of catalogues.

! *icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] Create catalogue*
! Create a new catalogue.

! _List of opened catalogues_
! The navigation shows all catalogues that you accessed during your current session. This allows you to quickly switch between the catalogues you are currently working on. The catalogue that is currently on view is shown in blue. The names of the other catalogues are shown in grey. +
*_Tip:_* If the list gets too long or you find it distracting, point your cursor to a catalogue in the list. An X is shown. Click on that X to close the catalogue.

! icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] Settings
! Open the catalogue settings. +

* Basic settings = Name and format type of the catalogue. You enter this information to create a catalogue.
* Format settings = Settings for the export file structure
* Export settings = Settings for automatic export
* Download settings = Settings for the URL that is used to access the export file

*_Important:_* You do not need these settings for most markets. These settings are only relevant if you want to export data to a file.

! icon:order_return_create_edit[set=plenty] *Mapping*
! Shown when you open the catalogue. Here, you map suitable plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data fields.

! icon:filter_alt[set=material] Filter
! Add filters to only export specific records.

! icon:order_return_create_edit[set=plenty] *Own data fields*
! Own data fields are currently not available for most exports.

| *Toolbar*
| The toolbar provides actions for the catalogue.

[cols="1,5a"]
!===
! icon:save[role="darkGrey"]
! Saves the catalogue settings.

! icon:preview[set=material]
! Creates a preview of the export data. The preview contains the first 5 data rows of the export file. +
*_Important:_* The preview function is not available for all marketplace formats.

! icon:download[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"]
! Starts the manual download of the catalogue data. +
*_Important:_* This option starts a manual export. The data is _not_ exported to the market.

! icon:more_vert[set=material]
! Show additional actions.

* icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] = Activate to only view mandatory fields.
* icon:restore[role="darkGrey"] = Restores an earlier version of the catalogue.
* icon:delete[set=material] = Deletes the catalogue.

| *Marketplace data field*
| To the right of the navigation, all data fields available for the market are listed. Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk (&#42;). +
*_Tip:_* In the toolbar, click on the further actions (icon:more_vert[set=material]) to show or hide optional data fields.

| *plentymarkets data fields*
| The right side of the catalogue is where you map the marketplace data fields with suitable plentymarkets data fields.
Before you map the first data field, all you can see here is a whole lot of icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Add data field* buttons. That’s normal and as it should be. +
*_Tip:_* In the screenshot, a few the fields are already mapped.

[#market-formats]
== What is a catalogue with marketplace format?

Every market structures product data differently. Often, different product information is even exported to the same market for different product categories (pet food, household items, food, etc.).

Catalogues with marketplace formats allow you to tailor your item information exactly to the needs of the market. Because here, you assign a suitable plentymarkets data field to each of the data fields of the market. When your variation data is exported to the market, the market’s data fields are then filled with the correct plentymarkets data.

* A marketplace format contains a matrix of the data fields that a market can process. As such, marketplace formats tell you what data can be exported to the market. The asterisks also help you to see straight away which data is obligatory and which is option.

* One market can offer several marketplace formats. For example, there might be different formats for different product categories (pet food, food, non-food, etc.) or for different languages. However, for some market you export all item data in a single catalogue. An example for this is Etsy.

*_What are the advantages of these catalogues?_*

* Every format is based on the data structure of a specific market. As such, you know exactly which variation data is necessary to sell your products on the market.
* You choose for each market and sometimes even for each market category which variation data is going to be published on the market. For example, you can use properties to export different variation names and descriptions to different markets.
* You can easily copy and adjust well configured catalogues.

*_Let’s talk straight: Aren#t there any disadvantages?_*

It really depends. The catalogues give you maximum flexibility. You can map data fields any way you like. However, that also means that mappings are not checked on whether or not they make any sense. As an example, the system will not prevent you from mapping the variation ID as the price. You might only notice such a mistake when your variations are either not exported to the market or when your t-shirts suddenly cost a few thousand bucks. However, this is only a disadvantage if you don’t work carefully. The more familiar you are with the catalogues, the easier it will be for you to map the data fields. You can always copy and adjust well configured catalogues. That also makes your work easier.

[#properties]
== Properties instead of characteristics

[discrete]
===== Properties are the new characteristics!

You cannot map characteristics or free text fields in the catalogues. Instead, you use properties to export data to the markets.

The properties are similar to the old characteristics and free text fields. As such, you use properties to save data for which there is no setting and no input field in the plentymarkets back end. In our context, the main difference is that you saved characteristics and free text fields for items. Instead, properties are saved for each variation separately. This gives you a lot of flexibility.

Below are two examples on how to use properties.

<<#example-1, Example 1: Diameter information>>
<<#example-2, Example 2: Brand names>>

* Is this your first time working with properties? For further information, refer to the item xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Properties] page.

[#example-1]
=== Example 1: Diameter information

*_Use case_*: +
A sales channel allows you to send the *diameter* and the *diameter unit* of your products. However, there is no field in the plentymarkets item menu where you can save diameter information for a variation.

*_Recommended:_* +
To still export information about the diameter of a variation to the market, we recommend the following workflow:

First, create the properties:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.
. Create a property *Diameter unit* with the following values:
  ** Section: *Item* +
  ** Property type: *Selection*
. Save the necessary units as property values, for example `cm` and `mm`.
. Create a property *Diameter* with the following values:
  ** Section: *Item* +
  ** Property type: *Decimal number*

Now, link the properties with the variation and save values:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation]*.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. Add the property *Diameter unit*.
. Select the unit from the drop-down list.
. Add the property *Diameter*.
. Enter the diameter in the unit you selected for the property *Diameter unit*.

To export the diameter of your variations to the market:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues » [Open catalogue]*.
. Navigate to the marketplace data field *Diameter unit*.
. Click on *+ Add data field*.
. In the list of plentymarkets data fields shown, expand the folder *Property*.
. Click on the Plus icon to the right of the plentymarkets data field *Diameter unit*.
. Navigate to the marketplace data field *Diameter*.
. Click on *+ Add data field*.
. In the list of plentymarkets data fields shown, expand the folder *Property*.
. Click on the Plus icon to the right of the plentymarkets data field *Diameter*.

[#example-2]
=== Example 2: Brand names

*_Use case_*: +
The sales channel allows you to transfer the brand name of products. In plentymarkets, you can save manufacturers but there is no default data field for saving brand names. Manufacturer and brand name are identical in many cases. If not, properties are your friends once more.

*_Recommended:_* +
If the manufacturer names saved in your system are not identical to the products’ brand names, you can save brand names using properties. We recommend the following workflow for exporting brands in properties:

First, create the property:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.
. Create a property *Brand* with the following settings:
  ** Section: *Item*
  ** Property type: *Text*

Now, link the properties with the variation and save a value:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation]*.
. Switch to the tab *Texts*.
. Add the property *Brand*.
. Save the brand name as the value of the property.

To export the brand of your variations to the market:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues » [Open catalogue]*.
. Navigate to the marketplace data field *Brand*.
. Click on *+ Add data field*.
. In the list of plentymarkets data fields shown, expand the folder *Property*.
. Click on the Plus icon to the right of the plentymarkets data field *Brand*.

[#data-fields]
== Which data fields are available?

Great question!

The following applies:

* <<#marketplace-fields, Marketplace data field>>
* <<#plentymarkets-fields, plentymarkets data fields>>

[#marketplace-fields]
=== Marketplace data field

[discrete]
===== Marketplace data fields, I barely know you

Marketplace data fields are the fields for which you can export data to the market. Because every market structures and processes item data differently, each market also has different marketplace data fields.

[[marketplace-data-fields]]
.Marketplace data fields in the OTTO Market catalogue
image::markets:marketplace-data-fields.png[]

*_What you should know about marketplace data fields:_*

* The marketplace data fields are shown on the left side of the catalogue.
* In the catalogue, mandatory fields are flagged with an asterisk. You definitely need to map plentymarkets data fields for these mandatory fields. In addition, values must be saved for these data fields for each variation. Otherwise, the variation will not be exported to the market.
* All other data fields are optional but will likely increase your sales performance. If no data is saved for one or more of these optional fields is saved for a variation, the variation is still exported to the market.
* The best information about marketplace data fields is provided by the market itself. Read the market’s documentation to find out exactly what data is expected. When in doubt, ask your contact person at the market. If everything else fails, you might want to lean on aunt G**gle: Try searching for the name of the marketplace in combination with “data feed”, “data specification” or just enter the name of the marketplace data field and see what happens.

[#plentymarkets-fields]
=== plentymarkets data fields

The plentymarkets data fields in the catalogue are the same settings as the ones you can select for your items and variations in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation]*. In addition to these settings, you can also select the properties that are saved in your plentymarkets system.

[[plentymarkets-data-fields]]
.List of plentymarkets data field after clicking on *+ Add data field*
image::markets/plentymarkets-data-fields.png[]

*_What you should know about plentymarkets data fields:_*

* A market expects product data that cannot be saved for a variation directly? Create a property. Then, link this property with your variations. Save product data as the values for this property.
* You can map a fallback data field in addition to a plentymarkets data field. All plentymarkets data field are again available as fallback data fields. The difference is that the content of the fallback data field is only exported if the first mapped plentymarkets data field does not exist or is empty.
* Check out the manual page for the standard format xref:data:catalogues-item.adoc#[Item (new)] to find out which data is exported with which plentymarkets data fields.

[#mappings]
== Which mappings are available?

In this chapter, we give you the lowdown of the available mappings.

This information is structured like this:

* <<#mappings-what-is, What does “mapping” mean?>>
* <<#one-to-one, Simple 1:1 mappings>>
* <<#one-to-one-complex, Complex 1:1 mappings>>
* <<#one-to-one-fallback, 1:1 mappings with fallback data fields>>
* <<#one-to-n, 1:n mappings>>
* <<#own-value, Own value mappings>>

[#mappings-what-is]
=== What does “mapping” mean?

Mapping means that the link a marketplace data field with a plentymarkets data field.
Slightly simplified and just to get you started: You do that by clicking on *Add data field* next to the marketplace data field.

However, what happens when you map these fields?

*For this one marketplace data field, I want to export the data to the market that is saved in this plentymarkets data field for the variation.*

*_Example:_*

You map the plentymarkets data field *Item text » Name 1* to the marketplace data field *Name*:

image::data:productname-example-1.png[]

As such, the name that is saved in the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings* for the setting *Name 1* is exported to the market for all variations.

For the variation you can see in the screenshot below, that means that the name *Design chair Black&White* is exported to the market.

image::data:productname-example-2.png[]

[#one-to-one]
=== Simple 1:1 mappings

[discrete]
===== Map 1 marketplace data field to the plentymarkets data field

In a 1:1 mapping, you map a plentymarkets data field to the marketplace data field. If no suitable setting exists in plentymarkets, you can map a property instead.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to fill this marketplace data field with the data from this plentymarkets setting.
* If the data field is empty for a variation, no value is exported for this variation.

[#one-to-one-fallback]
=== 1:1 mappings with fallback data fields

[discrete]
===== Map 1 marketplace data field to the plentymarkets data field and specify an alternative

You specify:

* I want to fill this marketplace data field with the data from this plentymarkets setting.
* If the data field is empty for a variation, the fallback data field is checked and the value of that fallback data field is exported instead.

All plentymarkets data field are available as fallback data fields. However, the content of the fallback data field is only exported if the first mapped data field does not exist or is empty for a variation.

*_Workflow for fallback data fields:_*

* During the export, the mapped plentymarkets data field of each variation is checked for content.
* If data is saved for a variation for that plentymarkets data field, then this data is exported.
* If the data field does not exist or is empty for a variation, the system jumps to the first fallback data field and checks if that field contains any data.
* If the fallback data field also does not contain data for the variation, the second fallback data field is checked and so on.
* If the system cannot find any data at all for a marketplace data field for a variation, what happens next depends on whether or not the data field is mandatory or not. If so, the variation is not exported. If not, the variation is exported but the marketplace data field is not filled on the market.

[#one-to-n]
=== 1:n mappings

[discrete]
===== Map SEVERAL plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data field

In a 1:n mapping, you map several plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data field. You can link these settings with a separator.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to combine these plentymarkets data fields during export so that the marketplace data field is filled with the data of these two or more plentymarkets settings.

// TODO: limango as an example when the plugin is public.

[#own-value]
=== Own value mappings

[discrete]
===== Map the same value for all variations to the marketplace data field

You are sure that you want to export the same value for all variations of a catalogue for a marketplace data field? Then specify an own value. This own value is then exported for all variations.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to export the value that I entered in the field *Own value* for _all_ variations of this catalogue.

*_Example:_*

You want to export diameter information for some of your variations. The diameter is saved in centimetres for all your variations. Instead of creating a property for the unit and linking this property to every variations, you can enter the own value `cm`.

[#file-export]
== _Optional:_ File export (no market export)

Catalogues with marketplace formats are automatically exported to markets if all your settings are correct. That means you can ignore the catalogue settings for *Format settings*, *Export settings* and *Download settings*.

However, you can also export a file that contains the data that is also exported to the market.

[tabs]
====
One-time file export::
+
--

Use these instructions to create a one-time export of the catalogue data. The catalogue data is *_not_* exported to the market.

NOTE: The export process is started when you click on *Download data*. However, note that there will be _no_ window for downloading the file straight away. When the export is completed, you can download the export file from the Notifications.

[.instruction]
Exporting catalogue data to a file once:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Click on the catalogue. +
→ The catalogue opens.

[#switch-to-catalogues]
== Switching from the old export to catalogue export

For some markets, you can either use an old export or a catalogue format. Find out how to switch here.

. Analyse which characteristics and free text fields you currently use for the data export to this market. Characteristics and free text fields cannot be used for the catalogue export. So create properties for all data that you still need. +
*_Important:_* The values of the new properties must be identical to the values of the old characteristics. Otherwise, new items may be created during the export to the market.
. Create a catalogue. For some markets, you have to install a new plugin first. Check the manual page of the individual markets to find out if this is the case.
. Open the catalogue and check which data fields can be exported to the market.
  * Map suitable plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data fields. +
  *_Important:_* Map the same plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data fields that are currently exported with the elastic export. Otherwise, new items may be created during the export to the market.
  * If necessary, create more properties.
. Prepare your variations:
  * If you have created new properties, then link these properties with the variations.
  * For some markets, you also need a property to link the variation to the correct category of the marketplace. This property is created automatically. Check the manual page of the individual markets for this information.
. Ready? Then activate the catalogue to start the data export.
