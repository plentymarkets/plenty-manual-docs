This page describes the data fields and filters that are available when exporting order and order item data with the catalogue tool.
This page serves purely as a reference and it assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#, catalogue tool>>.

You can find a practical example how to export orders and order items on the manual page <<data/exporting-data/catalogues-orders#, Practical example: orders and order items>>.

[discrete]
==== Format type: Order

The format type described on this page is found in the menu *Data » Catalogues*.
When creating a new catalogue, you’ll select the standard format from the upper drop-down list.
Then you can select the format type *Order* from the middle drop-down list.

[.collapseBox]
.*What’s a standard format?
--

* *_Definition_*:
A standard format is used to export specific data from your plentymarkets system.
Afterwards, you can revise the data and import it again.

* *_Example_*:
Imagine you want to get an overview of orders with a specific referrer and for a certain period of time. Then you can export the information you need and add them to your records.

* *_Differentiation_*:
Note that standard formats only export data from your system.
They do not transmit this data to marketplaces.

[TIP]
.Adapting export keys
====
To the left of newly added data fields, you can enter an *Export key*. The export key is the name under which the values of a data field are grouped in your export file. The export keys can be adapted. +
Always make sure that the export key is unique especially when you add the same data field several times and select different options. If the same export key is used more than once only the data field which was added last with this export key is exported. +
Find more information on data fields in general in the manual chapter <<data/exporting-data/file-export#add-fields, Adding data fields to export>>.

[#10]
== Data fields
This chapter lists all of the order data fields that can be exported with the catalogue tool.

Data fields are grouped by topic in folders and subfolders. All data fields of one folder are shown in one table. Thus, the structure of the chapters mirrors the folder structure.

[#30]
=== Order
The data field folder *Order* contains all data fields with basic order data. Some of these data fields are grouped in subfolders These subfolders structured by topic:

* *Amounts*
* *References*
* *Configuration*
* *Payment terms*
* *Order items*

The subfolder *Amounts* contains a further subfolder called *Vat*. The subfolder *Order items* contains two further subfolders called *Order item references* and *Order item amounts*. Thus, the folder structure has three levels.

*_Note_*: You have to select for every data field of this subfolder, whether the amount should be exported in your <<payment/currencies#30, system currency>> or the currency of the order. This also applies to the *VAT* subfolder. Moreover, it makes sense to always add the data fields *Currency* and *Exchange rate*. This way, you ensure that you always have all the needed data and information, no matter which currency they are in.

===== VAT
In this subfolder, data fields for order amounts and VATs are grouped.

*_Note_*: You have to select for every data field of this subfolder, whether the amount should be exported in your <<payment/currencies#30, system currency>> or the currency of the order. In a further drop-down list, you also have to select the VAT rate. The values for the selected VAT rate are then exported in the export file.

*Example*: +
You export two orders. One has tax rate A with the corresponding values: tax rate, tax rate in % and the amounts calculated with this. The other has tax rate B with the corresponding values: tax rate, tax rate in % and the amounts calculated with this. +
You add every data field of the VAT subfolder once. In the selection for the data fields of the VAT subfolder you then select *Rate A*. +
In the export file, all values for the first order with tax rate A are exported. For the second order with tax rate B, _no_ values are exported. +
If you want to export values for both orders with the different tax rates (A and B), you have to add the data fields twice. In the drop-down list *Select tax rate* you then select *Rate A* for the first data field and *Rate B* for the second data field. This way, all values are exported in the export file. +
Don’t forget to adapt the *Export keys* when you add the same data field several times.

==== References
In this subfolder, data fields for order references are grouped. For example, an order reference is created when a return is created from an order. Or a credit order from a return. Another reference exists between main order and delivery order, for example.

After adding a data field from this folder, the following selection is available to you:

* *Parent* = The parent order. The order from which the exported order was created. +
_Example_: If the exported order is a delivery order, the order ID of the original order, from which the delivery order was created, is exported. +
* *Reorder* = If the exported order is a reorder which was created directly in another order, the order ID of this order from which it was created is exported.
* *Grouped* = When an order was created by <<orders/managing-orders#1700, grouping>> other orders, several references of the type *Grouped* exist. These are references to the original orders. By this, you can easily see of an order was created by grouping several original orders. If it is a grouped order, the order IDs of the original orders are exported. +
* *Split* = When an order is <<orders/managing-orders#intable-splitting-orders, split>> into two new orders, each of the two new orders has a reference to the original order from which they were created. In this case, the order ID of the original order which was split is exported.

*_Note_*: The selection for *Order reference* has to be made for every data field in this folder.

===== Order item references
In this subfolder, data fields for order item references are grouped. +
A reference to another order item exists in a delivery order, for example. The order items of a delivery order are connected to the order items of the main order because they were created from them. In this case, the order items in the main order are the parent. +

After adding a data field from this folder, the following selection is available to you:

* *Parent* = The superordinate item position. +
* *Order property* = An order property references the variation in the main order to which the order property belongs. This selection is useful, for example, of an order has several order items with the same variation ID which were then customised with order properties.
An order property is referenced. +
* *Bundle* = The order item as a reference to a bundle. +
* *Set* = The order item as a reference to a set.

*_Note_*: The selection for *Order item reference* has to be made for every data field in this folder.
