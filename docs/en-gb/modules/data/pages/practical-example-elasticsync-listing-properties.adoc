In this best practice you will learn how to add eBay properties to your listings via the import tool.

== Exporting listings

First export the listings that you want to add properties to. You need a CSV file containing your listings in order to add the eBay properties. To do so, use the dynamic export in the *Data » Dynamic export* menu to create a data format of the type *ItemListingMarketEbay*. The properties can then be exported with this data format. +

The fields *EbayItemSpecificsName* and *EbayItemSpecificsValue* are required to create eBay properties.

[instruction]
Creating a data format:

. Go to *Data » Dynamic export*.
. Click on *New data format*. +
→ A view for editing the data format opens.
. Select *ItemListingMarketEbay* from the *Data format type* drop-down list.
. Enter a *Data format name*.
. Place check marks next to *EbayItemSpecificsName*, *EbayItemSpecificsValue*, and *MLID*. These fields are required to export listing properties.
. *Save* the data format after you have carried out further settings, if desired.

After having created the data format *ItemListingMarketEbay*, click on *Export data* to generate the CSV file. +

Save the CSV that you have created on your computer and edit it.

[TIP]
.Pay attention to the format of the CSV file

Multiple entries have to be separated by comma. +
_Example:_ Enter the values "Colour", "Size" into the *name* column separated by comma. Enter the corresponding values "Green", "XXL" into the *value* column separated by comma.
