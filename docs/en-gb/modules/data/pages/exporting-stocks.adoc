//ToDo - check whether the storage location name and ID are still being exported language-specific and delete the info as needed - see comment within storage location table

This page describes the data fields and filters that are available when exporting stock data with the catalogue tool.
This page serves purely as a reference and it assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the xref:data:export-standard-formats#[catalogue tool].

[discrete]
==== Format type: Stocks

The format type described on this page is found in the menu *Data » Catalogues*.
When creating a new catalogue, you’ll select the standard format from the upper drop-down list.
Then you can select the format type *Stocks* from the middle drop-down list.

image::data:catalogue-stocks.png[]

[TIP]
.What’s a standard format?
====

* *_Definition_*:
A standard format is used to export specific data from your system.
If necessary, you can revise the data and import it again.

* *_Example_*:
Imagine you’re facing an audit and you need to find out how much stock was in your warehouse at the end of the year.
You could export a CSV file with the stock data.

* *_Differentiation_*:
Note that standard formats only export data from your system.
They do not transmit this data to marketplaces.

== Filters

This chapter lists all of the filters that you can use to limit which data is included in the export file.

[TIP]
.Filters can be combined
====
You can select multiple filters and thus e.g. filter stock that is from a specific warehouse and has a specific flag.
====

[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Filter |Explanation

| *Active*
|Limits the export to variations that are either xref:item:managing-items.adoc#intable-active[active or inactive].

| *Flag 1*; +
*Flag 2*
|Select a flag from the drop-down list.
Limits the export to items with this xref:item:new-item.adoc#200[flag].

| *Date*
|Use this filter to export the physical stock level from a specific point in time.

*_Example_*:
Imagine you’re facing an audit and you need to find out how much stock was in your warehouse at the end of the year.

*_Formatting_*:
Enter the date in the format `DD.MM.YYYY`.
Alternatively, click on the calendar symbol (icon:calendar-o[role="darkGrey"]) if you would prefer to choose the date from the calendar.

---

*_Note_*: It’s only possible to filter a maximum of 3 months in the past.

*_Note_*: This filter _can not_ be used in combination with item bundles.

*_Note_*: This filter _can not_ be used in combination with the filter *Hide empty stock entries*.

* *Storage location*
* *Storage location ID*
* *Storage location quantity*
* *Storage location name*

| *Manufacturers*
|Select one or more manufacturers from the drop-down list.
Limits the export to items that were xref:item:managing-items.adoc#_basic_settings[manufactured by one of these companies].

!===

! *Hide stock 0 entries after defined time period*

!===

| *Group by*

The variation’s stock is shown per warehouse (not per storage location, BBD or batch).

| *Item bundle*
|Select one or more options from the drop-down list.

[cols="1,3"]

! *Not part of a bundle*
!Limits the export to variations that are neither an item bundle nor a bundle component.

== FAQ

[.collapseBox]
.*What does “Export Key” mean?*
--

The “Export Keys” are the names of the column headers, as they will appear in your export file.
Every “Export Key” needs to be unique.

* *_Negative example_*: You use the data fields xref:data:exporting-stocks.adoc#30[Item ID] and xref:data:exporting-stocks.adoc#100[Variation ID].
You give both “Export Keys” the name “id”.
As a result, the export file only includes one of the two IDs.
A column is missing in the export file.
* *_Positive example_*: You use the data fields xref:data:exporting-stocks.adoc#30[Item ID] and xref:data:exporting-stocks.adoc#100[Variation ID].
You give one “Export Key” the name “VariationID” and the other “ItemID”.
