Events in your system are logged in the menu *Data » Log*. This allows you to check the data log for errors without relying on our support.

Events with the severities *Error*, *Critical*, *Alert* and *Emergency* are logged automatically. You can activate logging of other events for a limited time if and when needed.

== What is the data log?

The data log documents events that occur in your system.

* Each log entry is equivalent to one event in your system.
* Each log entry is available for four weeks after the event. After that time, the log entry is deleted automatically.
* Events can have different degrees of severity. In plentymarkets, these different severities are called log levels.
* Events with the log levels *Error*, *Critical*, *Alert* and *Emergency* are logged automatically.
* The log levels *Debug*, *Info*, *Notice* and *Warning* are not logged by default. Instead, you need to activate them to document events with this severity. (<<#10, How?>>)
* Each log entry contains the following information about the event:

== Finding log entries

When you open the menu *Data » Log*, a list of all logged events for the default client is shown. This list is sorted by date and time. As such, the latest event is at the top of the list.

You can filter the log entries to reduce the list of events and make it more manageable.

[.instruction]
Filtering the list of log entries:

. Go to *Data » Log*. +
→ All logged events of the default client are shown.
. At the top left of the toolbar, click on (icon:filter[set=material]). +
→ The available filters are shown.
. Select the filters you want to apply. Note the explanations in <<#log-filter>>. +
*_Is a filter missing from the drop-down lists?_* +
The drop-down lists only contain filters for events for which log entries exist. So if for example you cannot select a filter for *OTTO Market* from the list, that means that no events were logged for this market in the last four weeks.
. Click on (icon:search[role="blue"]) *Search*. +
→ The filtered log entries are shown. +
*_Could not find the log entry you were looking for?_* +
 Not all events are logged by default. So you might have to <<#10, activate the logging for the event you are trying to find>>.

== Activating optional logging

Events with the log levels *Error*, *Critical*, *Alert* and *Emergency* are logged automatically.
However, to log events with the log levels *Debug*, *Info*, *Notice* or *Warning*, you need to activate logging first.

* Logging ends automatically once the duration you set is up.
* You are unsure about what to log and confused about integrations, reference types and identifiers? For many markets, you can find info on what to filter for on the manual page for that market. Or head to the forum to ask which system areas you need to log to find out what’s going on.

[.instruction]
Activating optional logging:

. Go to *Data » Log*. +
→ All events logged for the default client are shown.
. In the top left of the toolbar, click on *Configure logs* (icon:cog[]). +
→ The window *Log configuration* opens. +
→ On the left side, the system areas and any installed plugins are listed.
. Select the area in which you want to configure logs. +
→ On the right side, the settings for the area you selected are shown.
. Activate the option *Active*.
. In the drop-down list *Duration*, select how long you want to log events for this area.
. In the drop-down list *Log level*, select the events that you want to log. +
<<#log-levels, What do the log levels mean?>>
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The logging of the events starts. +
→ Logging ends automatically once the duration you set is up. +
*_Important:_* The first log entry only becomes available once the event that you want to log next occurs.
