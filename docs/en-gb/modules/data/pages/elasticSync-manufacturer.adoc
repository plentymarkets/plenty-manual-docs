|Setting |Explanation

| *Manufacturer ID*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the manufacturer IDs? Choose this column here.
This option is useful if you want to _update existing manufacturer data records_.

*_Background info_*: Every new manufacturer automatically receives an ID, which can not be changed.
The ID is used to uniquely identify the manufacturer.
Because the ID is unique, it’s a good way to check whether the imported data record already exists in plentysystems.

| *Manufacturer name*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the manufacturer name? Choose this column here.
This option is useful if you want to _create new manufacturer data records_.

| *External manufacturer name*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the external manufacturer name? Choose this column here.
