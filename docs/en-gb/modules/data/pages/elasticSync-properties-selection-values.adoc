Do you have properties of the type *Selection* or *Multi-selection*?
The unique thing about these two property types is that they have individual _values_ that are available for _selection_.
Such selection values can be created manually or they can be imported.

[IMPORTANT]
.Requirements
====
Make sure you’ve already created properties of the type *Selection* or *Multi-selection*.
This can either be done xref:item:properties.adoc#600[manually] or xref:data:elasticSync-properties.adoc#[via import].
Afterwards, you can import the selection values as described on this page.

In other words, it’s not possible to create the properties and their selection values together in one import.
This needs to be done in two separate imports.

.Matching fields for selection values
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Matching field |Explanation

| *Selection ID*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the selection value IDs?
Choose this column here.
This option is useful if you want to _update existing selection values_.

*_Background info_*: Every new selection value automatically receives an ID, which can not be changed.
The ID is used to uniquely identify the selection value.
Because the ID is unique, it’s a good way to check whether the imported data record already exists in plentymarkets.

| *Selection name*
|Which column of your CSV file contains the selection value’s name?
Choose this column here.
Then select the name’s language from the second drop-down list.
This option is useful if you want to _create new selection values_.

*_Additional settings_*:
This option can only be used together with the matching field *Property ID* or *Property name*. +
Why?
It’s possible to save the same selection name for multiple properties.
The selection name alone isn’t a unique identifier.
Therefore, use the selection name together with the property ID or the property name.

| *Property ID*
|Did you choose *Selection name* as the matching field?
If so, then you’ll also need to use *Property ID* or *Property name*.

*_Background info_*:
It’s possible to save the same selection name for multiple properties.
The selection name alone isn’t a unique identifier.
Therefore, use the selection name together with the property ID or the property name.

Which column of your CSV file lists the property IDs?
Choose this column here.

| *Property name*
|Did you choose *Selection name* as the matching field?
If so, then you’ll also need to use *Property ID* or *Property name*.

*_Background info_*:
It’s possible to save the same selection name for multiple properties.
The selection name alone isn’t a unique identifier.
