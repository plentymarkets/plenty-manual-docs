[IMPORTANT]
.No new features planned for this module
====
The statistics module described on this page will not be developed further. This means that no new functionalities will be added in the future. To process your business data, you can already use the newly introduced <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/myview-dashboard#, dashboard>>. The dashboard is part of the <<business-decisions/plenty-bi#, plentyBI>> module and provides you with even more flexibility for evaluating your statistics.
====

The plentymarkets statistics module allows you to keep track of everything that is happening in your organisation and more importantly to analyse revenue based on your different sales channels. Use filters to adjust the analysis to your needs. You can show the data either as a chart or listed in tables.

Statistics are grouped in tabs. You can create up to 4 statistics per tab.  These tabs help you to group and sort your statistics. The name of these tabs should reflect the statistics grouped in this section.

[NOTE]
.Do not close the statistics tab
====
When you click on the tab’s *X*, the tab is deleted, not closed.

[#10]
== Getting to know the statistic types

This chapter provides an overview and a short description of the statistics available in plentymarkets. The statistics are created based on the data available in your plentymarkets system. The filters allow you to create very specific individual statistics. For example, you can create statistics for individual markets by selecting the relevant order referrers.

[TIP]
.Opening the Statistics menu

| *Shipping costs generated per shipping service provider*
|Shows the shipping costs by shipping service provider for the selected period.  The statistics is based on the date of outgoing items.

| *Shopping cart development*
|Shows the average shopping cart value and the average shipping costs for the selected period. The statistic provides an overview of shopping carts' development month by month. This allows you e.g. to check if high shipping costs often prevent customers from going through with buying the items they placed in the shopping cart.

[#30]
=== General statistics: Processes

The process statistics provide data for order processing activities, e.g. processing times, status changes and dunning.

.Types of *Processes* statistics
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Type of statistic |Explanation

| *Order processing times*
|Shows whether the majority of the order processing time was used in reaching the status *paid* or the status *shipped*. You will also see the percentage of total processing time that was needed.

[#50]
=== General statistics: Items

The item statistics allow you to analyse item data as a whole or filter them based on specific criteria such as flags, categories or referrers.

.Types of *Items* statistics
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Type of statistic |Explanation

| *Sold quantities* / *returns*
|Shows the number of items sold and the number of returns and the revenue for the selected period. All items are shown, i.e. including those items without returns.  The return rate shows you the relationship between how many times an item was sold and how many times it was returned.

| *Tops / Flops*
|Shows the top items, i.e. those sold most often, and/or the flops, i.e. the least sold variations for the selected period.  The variations are shown in descending order. This list will end with whichever top variation was sold the least often.  The list of flops begins with the variation that was sold the least often and progresses with variations that were sold more and more often. +
You can only analyse and export data for a period of 6 months. +
This statistic takes sold quantities into consideration when calculating basic items from item bundles. However, the purchase price and the revenue are not taken into consideration. The statistic shows which items are not lucrative. For example, you may notice that the warehouse and operating costs of an item are higher than the profit.

| *Sold item quantities*
|Shows items in sales ranges based on the number of items sold for the selected period.

.Types of *Customer* statistics
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Type of statistic |Explanation

| *Consumer behaviour*
|Shows how many customers (grouped by order quantity) generated a certain amount of revenue. For example, you can see which customers generate the most revenue: those who rarely purchase in your store or those who make purchases regularly.  The order quantities apply per customer. As such, e.g. the quantity *<3* means that the customers shown have generated less than 3 orders per customer.

| *Top / Flop customers*
|Shows the revenue data sorted by customers who generated the most revenue and those who generated the least revenue in the selected period. The customers will be listed in descending order.
