[#2010]
== Fields for order matching

<<table-matching-fields-order>> explains the fields that are available for matching order data. During the import, plentymarkets checks if the imported data record already exists based on the matching field.

[[table-matching-fields-order]]
.Matching fields for importing orders
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|*Setting* |*Explanation*

|*Orders*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the order IDs? Choose this column here. Optionally, you can decide if you want to define whether you have listed *Order IDs* or *External order IDs*. +
This option is useful if you want to *update existing orders*. +

_Background info_: Every new order automatically receives an ID, which cannot be changed. The ID is used to uniquely identify the order. Because the ID is unique, it’s a good way to check whether the imported order already exists in plentymarkets.

|*Package*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the shipping package IDs? Choose this column here.

|*Order item*
| Which column of your CSV file lists the order items? Choose this column here. Then select whether your CSV file contains *Order item IDs*, *External item IDs* or *External token IDs*.
|====

[[table-supplement-data]]
.Supplement data
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|*Setting* |*Explanation*

|*Variation*
| Which column of your CSV file lists the variation IDs? Choose this column here.  Then select whether your CSV file contains *Marketplace SKUs*, *External variation IDs*, *Variation numbers*, *Manufacturer variation number*, *Barcode: GTIN 13*, *Barcode: GTIN 128*, Barcode: UPC* or *Barcode: ISBN*. +
If you choose this matching field, the information stored in the system about this variation is loaded and added to the order. This, data is supplemented.
|====

[TIP]
.Creating new orders with the import and required fields in the mapping area
====
If you want to create new orders with the import, leave the fields in the *Matching* area empty. But note the required fields marked in the *Mapping* area. These are only relevant for the creation of new orders. If you want to update existing orders, you don't have to fill in all the required fields.

=== Link to order item

Do you want to add order properties, bundle components or set components to the order items of an order? Then use the mapping fields in this area and enter the corresponding values into your CSV file.

[#2710]
==== Link to order item ID

Enter the order item ID into your CSV file in the row of the order property or component you want to import. They are linked to the order item with this ID. You can get the order item ID when you export orders. You can either export orders with the xref:data:catalogues.adoc#[Catalogue] or the xref:data:order-items.adoc#1500[Format type Order items].

*_Default value_*: No default value

*_Permitted import values_*: Numeric

[#2720]
==== Set own identifier

Enter an identifier chosen by you into your CSV file. The identifier can be freely chosen and also include blank spaces and special characters. +
With this mapping field, the identifier is set to the order item. Use the mapping field *Link to own identifier* to also set the identifier to the order property or component. The identifier is then used to link the order item and order property or component. Because of this, you need both mapping fields in your CSV file.

*_Default value_*: No default value

*_Permitted import values_*: Alphanumeric

[#2725]
==== Link to own identifier

Enter the identifier chosen by you into your CSV file. With this mapping field, the identifier is set to the order property or component you want to import. Use the mapping field *Set own identifier* to also set the identifier to the order item to which the imported values are to be added. The identifier is then used to link the order item and order property or component. Because of this, you need both mapping fields in your CSV file.

*_Default value_*: No default value

*_Permitted import values_*: Alphanumeric

==== Example for import with identifier

image::data:order-set-identifier.png[]

In this example CSV file, you can see the order item in the first row and the order property you want to link to it in the second row. +
In the columns *OwnIdentifier* and *LinkToOwnIdentifier* of the CSV file, you can see the identifier *ABC123E*. This identifier can be freely chosen by you. The fields are outlined in red. Because of this identifier, the system knows which order property belongs to which order item. +
The identifier itself is not imported and is therefore not visible in the system after the import. By importing it, the order property is added with all the values given in the CSV file to the order item.
