[IMPORTANT]
.Requirements
====
In order to create or update storage locations via the import, a warehouse has to be created beforehand. +
====

[TIP]
.Practical example: Adjusting storage locations
====
Now and then, the data of storage locations has to be adjusted. How to export warehouse data, adjust the data accordingly and import it back into the system is explained step by step in xref:data:best-practices-elasticsync-storage-locations.adoc#[this practical example].

== Adjusting storage locations

You can adjust storage locations via the import tool and for example change the name or the position of the storage location.

[.instruction]
Adjusting storage locations:

. Go to *Data » Import*.
. Click on the import in the import overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Activate the field *Warehouse Location ID*.
. Select one of the *Import options*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Click on *Mapping*.
. Open the mapping from the overview.
. Expand the area *Warehouse location* on the right-hand side.
. Activate the fields *Storage location name* and *Position*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#2250]
== Creating storage locations

You can use the import tool to create new storage locations. Note that the structure of the warehouse has to be defined beforehand which means that at least one storage location already has to exist.

[.instruction]
Creating storage locations:

. Go to *Data » Import*.
. Click on the import in the import overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Select the field *Level ID*.
. Select one of the *Import options*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Click on *Mapping*.
. Open the mapping from the overview.
. Activate the lines in which the values *Storage location name*, *Purpose*, *Position* and *Status* can be found and select the respective source.
. Expand the area *Warehouse location* on the right-hand side and map the fields *Storage location name*, *Purpose*, *Position* and *Status*. The *Storage location ID* will be assigned automatically. Thus, you cannot create it via import.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#2260]
== Deleting storage locations

You can delete storage locations with the import tool. This only applies to storage locations without stock.

[.instruction]
Deleting storage locations:

. Go to *Data » Import*.
. Click on the import in the import overview. +
→ The settings open.
. Switch to the *Matching* tab.
. Select the field *Warehouse Location ID*.
. Select one of the *Import options*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Click on *Mapping*.
. Open the mapping from the overview.
. Expand the area *Warehouse location* on the right-hand side.
. Activate the field *Delete storage location*.
. You can either delete all storage locations or only specific ones. Carry out the respective settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-deleting-storage-locations>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-deleting-storage-locations]]
.Deleting all storage locations or only specific ones
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|Deleting all storage locations
|All storage location IDs that exist in the CSV file will be deleted. +
 For the Delete storage location value, select *Own value*. +
 Then select *0* (do not delete) or *1* (delete).

|Deleting only specific storage locations
|Here, the CSV file contains two values: on the one hand there are the storage location IDs and on the other hand there are the values *0* (do not delete) and *1* (delete) by which you can determine whether the value should be deleted.
|====

[NOTE]
.Empty dimension is automatically deleted
====
In case all storage locations of a dimension (e.g. Rack 2) are deleted, the dimension (here Rack 2) is automatically deleted, too.
