|Setting |Explanation

| *Facet ID*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the facet IDs? Choose this column here.
This option is useful if you want to _update existing facets_.

*_Background info_*: Every new facet automatically receives an ID, which can not be changed.
The ID is used to uniquely identify the facet.
Because the ID is unique, it’s a good way to check whether the imported data record already exists in plentymarkets.

| *Facet value ID*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the facet value IDs? Choose this column here.
This option is useful if you want to _update existing facet values_.

*_Background info_*: Every new facet value automatically receives an ID, which can not be changed.
The ID is used to uniquely identify the facet value.
Because the ID is unique, it’s a good way to check whether the imported data record already exists in plentymarkets.

| *Facet name*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the facet name? Choose this column here.
This option is useful if you want to _create new facets_.

| *Facet value name*
|Which column of your CSV file lists the facet value name? Choose this column here.
This option is useful if you want to _create new facet values_.

What sort of facet do you want to create?
Allow your customers to filter products by the following criteria: attribute, characteristic, property, brand name, availability, price range.

Enter the appropriate type into the CSV file.
This setting can not be changed once you’ve created the facet.

*_Default value_*: No default value

[cols="1,1,3"]
|====
|Permitted import values in CSV file |Result in the back end |Explanation

|`dynamic`
|Attribute/characteristic
|This type can be used for many different scenarios.
The filter is linked to the attributes, characteristics or properties in your system.
Example: Choose this type if you want to create the filter “Colour” or “Size”.

|`producer`
|Manufacturer
|This type of filter is linked to the manufacturers in your system.
Example: Choose this type if you want to create the filter “Brand name”.

|`price`
|Price
|You do _not_ need to link this type of filter with values.
Example: Choose this type if you want to create the filter “Price range”.
Webshop visitors can individually limit the filter from the lowest to the highest price of a category.

|`availability`
|Availability
|This type of filter is linked to the availabilities in your system.
Example: Choose this type if you want customers to filter for items that ship within 24 hours.

|====
|Permitted import values in CSV file |Result in the back end |Explanation

* Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration
* Setup » Item » Attributes » [Open attribute] » Tab: Values
* Setup » Item » Availability
* Setup » Item » Manufacturers

[TIP]
.How do I link multiple values?
====
Imagine you sell t-shirts in all different colours such as “light blue”, “dark blue” and “turquoise”.
You want all three colours to be found with the blue colour filter.
In this case, you’ll need to link all three attribute values to the facet value.

* *_Preparation_*: Make sure the facet and facet value already exist in your system (see "Matching").
* *_CSV file_*: You will create one line per ID that should be linked.
In other words, the IDs for "light blue", "dark blue" and "turquoise" will be in three separate lines.
* *_Matching_*: You will use the facet ID and facet value ID, assuming that these values already exist (see "Preparation").
If the settings are configured like this, then e.g. the attribute value "light blue" will be linked in the first line and "dark blue" will be linked in the second line.
