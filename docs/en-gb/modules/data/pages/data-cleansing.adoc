This page of the manual describes how to delete certain data records after a certain time period has expired. You determine this time period in the *Setup » Settings » Hosting » Cleansing* menu.

There are 2 main reasons for deleting data using the data cleansing function:

* According to GDPR regulations, you as a seller are obliged to delete personal data saved in your system.
* In addition, you can use the data cleansing function to reduce memory usage. For example, this can help if the free memory capacity included in your plentymarkets edition is exceeded.

== Assigning user rights

Users of the type *Back end* can only access limited areas and menus in the plentymarkets back end. Thus, their access to the system is limited. If users of the type *Back end* should be able to work with the data cleansing menu, a user of the type *Admin* has to assign at least the rights listed in the following to users with *Back end* access.

[.instruction]
Assigning user rights for back end users:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*.
. Use the search function (icon:search[role="blue"]) and open the user account that should be edited.
. Activate in the *Authorisations* area, the options *Data > Cleansing > Show* and *Data > Cleansing > Edit*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
