This page describes the data fields and filters that are available when exporting manufacturer data with the catalogue tool.
This page serves purely as a reference and it assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the xref:data:file-export.adoc#[catalogue tool].

[discrete]
==== Format type: Manufacturers

The format type described on this page is found in the menu *Data » Catalogues*.
When creating a new catalogue, you’ll first select the standard format from the upper drop-down list.
Then you can select the format type *Manufacturers* from the middle drop-down list.

[TIP]
.What’s a standard format?
====

* *_Definition_*:
A standard format is used to export specific data from your plentymarkets system.
Afterwards, you can revise the data and import it again.

* *_Example_*:
Imagine you want to update the addresses and contact information for several manufacturers at once.
You could export a CSV file with the manufacturer data saved in your system.
Afterwards, you could revise the file and import it again.

* *_Differentiation_*:
Note that standard formats only export data from your system.
They do not transmit this data to marketplaces.
