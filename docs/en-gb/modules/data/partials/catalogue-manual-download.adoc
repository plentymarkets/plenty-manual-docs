Have you added at least one data field to the export? Then download the catalogue data manually. The format of the download file depends on the xref:data:export-standard-formats.adoc#format-settings[format settings of the catalogue]. You can export data in CSV, TXT, JSON and XML files.

//tag::single-export[]
There are two ways to manually export the catalogue data:

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Asynchronous download
| The export runs in the background. Once the download is completed, you download the export file from the Notifications (material:notifications[]).

| Live download
| The file is downloaded to your computer automatically. You can follow the export progress in real time. +
*_However:_* Do not close or reload the browser tab or the plentymarkets tab *Data export* while the export is in progress. If you do so, the export will be cancelled.

//tag::async-export[]
For asynchronous downloads, the export runs in the background. So note that there will be _no_ window for downloading the file straight away. Even exporting small amounts of data will take around 30 minutes. When the export is completed, you can download the export file from the Notifications (material:notifications[]).

[.instruction]
Starting an asynchronous download:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Open the catalogue.
. In the toolbar at the top, click on *Download data* (material:file_download[]). +
*_Or:_* Even quicker: Start the download from the *Additional actions* (material:more_vert[]) in the catalogue overview. +
→ The export starts. +
*_Important:_* The export runs in the background. Note that there will be _no_ window for downloading the file straight away. Even exporting small amounts of data will take around 30 minutes. +
Once the export is finished, you will be notified (material:notifications_none[]) that the export file can be downloaded.
. In the notification centre, click on material:link[] *Download*. +
*_Tip:_* The notification is no longer shown? Use the URL shown in the *Download settings* to access the file at any time.

//tag::live-download[]
The live download creates the file and automatically downloads it to your computer. In the tab *Data export*, you can follow the download progress in real time. However:

* When you start the live download, a new browser tab opens. In this browser tab, the plentymarkets tab *Data export* is shown. Do not close or reload the browser tab and the plentymarkets tab *Data export* while the export is in progress. If you do, the export stops and is cancelled.
* You can start live downloads for several catalogues at the same time. However, you can only start a new live download for the same catalogue once the current export is complete.

[.instruction]
Starting a live download:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +
→ The catalogue overview opens.
. Open the catalogue.
. In the toolbar at the top, click on *Live download* (material:play_circle_outline[]). +
*_Or:_* Even quicker: Start the download from the *Additional actions* (material:more_vert[]) in the catalogue overview. +
→ A new browser tab opens. plentymarkets and the tab *Data export* are shown. +
*_No new tab?_* Then you are probably using a pop-up blocker. Allow pop-ups for your system to continue. +
→ The export starts. +
*_Important:_* Do not close or reload the browser tab or the plentymarkets tab *Data export* while the export is in progress. If you do, the export stops and is cancelled. +
→ The progress is shown in real time. +
