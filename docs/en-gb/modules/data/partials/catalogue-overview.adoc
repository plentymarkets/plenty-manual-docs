The catalogue overview is the first thing you see when you open the menu *Data » Catalogues*.

If you have not created any catalogues yet, the list of catalogues will be empty.

[#overview-navigation]
=== Navigation

The navigation allows you to switch between the different views. The view that is currently open is shown in blue font.

| material:menu[]

| icon:search[role="darkGrey"] *Overview*
| At the moment, you are already in the overview. That is why nothing happens when you click here.

| *icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] Create catalogue*
| Create a new catalogue.

| _List of opened catalogues_
| The navigation shows all catalogues that you accessed during your current session. This allows you to quickly switch between the catalogues you are working on at the moment. The catalogue that is currently on view is shown in blue. The names of the other catalogues are shown in grey.

*_Tip:_* If the list gets too long or you find it distracting, point your cursor to a catalogue in the list. An X is shown. Click on that X to close the catalogue.
