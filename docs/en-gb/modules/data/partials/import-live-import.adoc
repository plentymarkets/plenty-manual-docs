If you specified an interval in the import settings, the file is regularly imported automatically. However, you can also start an import manually at any time.

//tag::single-import[]
There are two ways to import the file:

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Import (material:play_circle_filled[role="blue"])
| The import runs in the background.

* *_Advantage:_* You can import large amounts of data. +
* *_Disadvantage:_* You cannot track the progress live.

| Live import (material:play_circle[role="blue"])
| The import starts immediately. The progress is shown in real time.

* *_Advantages:_*
  ** You can follow the import progress in real time.
  ** Results and any errors are shown directly underneath the progress bar.
* *_Disadvantages:_*
  ** The import can run into a timeout if you try to import large amounts of data. If that happens, the import is cancelled. In such cases, use the background import instead.
  ** Do not close or reload the browser tab or the plentymarkets tab *Data import* while the import is in progress. If you do so, the import will be cancelled.
