The catalogue menu is the same for all default formats:

Your catalogue still looks different? Then you probably opened a marketplace format. It is used to export item data to markets and price portals. Also useful and interesting. However, working with marketplace formats is described xref:export-marketplace-formats.adoc#[elsewhere].

[#menu-export-fields]
=== Data fields that are available for export

To the right of the navigation, all plentymarkets data fields that you can export are listed in groups. To add a data field to the export, click on the Plus icon to the light of the data field.

image:data:catalogue-default-data-fields.png[]

*_Tips:_*

* Use the field *Search data field* to quickly find and add data fields.
* In addition to the data fields listed, you can also add own values to the export. The same value is then exported for each record.
* Add the option **Formula** to recalculate numerical values during the export. For example, you could update all exported variation prices during the export.
endif::file-export[]

ifdef::file-export[]
[#menu-added-fields]
=== Data fields added to export

To the right, the data fields that you can add to the export are shown. So these data fields will be exported to your file.
Before you select a data field, you can see the message “No data fields were selected”. In the screenshot, a few the fields are already selected.

image:data:catalogue-default-added-fields.png[]

*_Tips:_*

* You can move the data fields using drag-and-drop. This will change the order in which the data fields are exported.
* You can change the export key. The “Export Keys” are the names of the column headers, as they will appear in your export file. Every “Export Key” needs to be unique.
* You can add fallback data fields. If the data field is empty or invalid, the first fallback data field is checked and the value of that fallback data field is exported instead.

ifdef::marketplace-export[]
[#menu-market-fields]

ifdef::marketplace-export[]
[#menu-plentymarkets-fields]
=== plentymarkets data fields

On the right side of the catalogue, you map the marketplace data fields to appropriate plentymarkets data fields.
Before you map the first data field, all you can see here is a whole lot of icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Add data field* buttons. That’s normal and as it should be.

image:data:catalogue-market-plenty-fields.png[]

*_Tip:_* One field was already mapped in the screenshot.
