Are you just starting out using catalogues? Then you’re in the right place. Get to know the catalogue overview and the catalogue menu before you dip you toes in and start creating catalogues yourself.

[#catalogue-overview]
=== Understanding the catalogue overview

The catalogue overview is the first thing you see when you open the menu *Data » Catalogues*.

// TODO: Insert screenshot of menu.

[#overview-navigation]
==== Navigation

The navigation allows you to switch between the different views. The view that you are currently in is shown in blue font.

// TODO: replace with screenshot of the whole menu with all other areas greyed out
image::data:catalogue-overview-navigation.png[]

[cols="1,2a"]
|===

| material:menu[]
| Show or hide the navigation.

| icon:search[role="darkGrey"] *Overview*
| At the moment, you are already in the overview. That is why nothing happens when you click here.

| *icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] Create catalogue*
| Create a new catalogue.

| _List of opened catalogues_
| The navigation shows all catalogues that you accessed during your current session. This allows you to quickly switch between the catalogues you are working on at the moment. The catalogue that is currently on view is shown in blue. The names of the other catalogues are shown in grey.

*_Tip:_* If the list gets too long or you find it distracting, point your cursor to a catalogue in the list. An X is shown. Click on that X to close the catalogue.

| Search and filters
| You already have a lot of catalogues? Then just filter the list.

* terra:reload[] = Applies the filter settings and reduces the list to those catalogues that match the filters.
* terra:reload[] = Resets the filters so that all catalogues are shown again.

[#overview-toolbar]
==== Toolbar

The toolbar provides actions for the catalogues.

// TODO: replace with screenshot of the whole menu with all other areas greyed out
image::data:catalogue-overview-toolbar.png[]

[cols="1,5a"]
|===
| icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]
| Create a new catalogue.

| material:content_copy[]
| Copy one or more catalogues that you selected in the first column of the list. (xref:data:catalogues-manage.adoc#190[How?])

| material:file_download[]
| Export one or more catalogues that you selected in the first column of the list. (xref:data:catalogues-manage.adoc#270[How?]) +
You can then import the exported catalogues into other plentymarkets systems. At the same time, an export also serves as a backup.

*_Note:_* These settings export the catalogue itself. As such, the import contains information on the settings and data fields the catalogue contains. The import cannot be used to import data for plentymarkets data fields.

| material:file_upload[]
| Import a catalogue. (xref:data:catalogues-manage.adoc#280[How?]) +
You can import catalogues from other plentymarkets systems or catalogues that you saved as a backup.

*_Note:_* These settings import the catalogue itself. As such, the import contains information on the settings and data fields the catalogue contains and not the data that is saved for these data fields in plentymarkets.

| material:history[]
| Restore a previous version of one or more catalogues. (xref:data:catalogues-manage.adoc#250[How?])

_or_

Restore a deleted catalogue. (xref:data:catalogues-manage.adoc#240[How?])

| material:delete[]
| Delete a catalogue. (xref:data:catalogues-manage.adoc#240[How?])

| *Results per page* material:arrow_drop_down[]

| material:arrow_back_ios[] material:arrow_forward_ios[]
| Navigate through the pages of the list.

*_Note_*: When you switch to another page, any catalogues you selected on the previous page are no longer selected.

| icon:cog[role="darkGrey"]
| Open the pop-up window to customise which columns are shown in the list. (<<#overview-customise, How?>>)

[#catalogue-menu]
=== Understanding the catalogue menu for default formats

The catalogue menu is the same for all default formats:

image::data:menu-structure-standard-format.png[]

Your catalogue still looks different? Then you probably opened a marketplace format. It is used to export item data to markets and price portals. Also useful and interesting. However, working with marketplace formats is described xref:export-marketplace-formats.adoc#[elsewhere].
endif::file-export[]

[#catalogue-menu]
=== Understanding the catalogue menu for marketplace formats

The catalogue menu is the same for all marketplace formats:

image::markets:catalogue-menu-colours.png[]

Your catalogue still looks different? Then you probably opened a catalogue with a default format. That is used to export data to a file. Also useful and interesting. However, working with standard formats is described xref:export-standard-formats.adoc#[elsewhere].

[#menu-export-fields]
==== Data fields that are available for export

To the right of the navigation, all plentymarkets data fields that you can export are listed in groups. To add a data field to the export, click on the Plus icon to the light of the data field.

image:data:catalogue-default-data-fields.png[]

*_Tips:_*

* Use the field *Search data field* to quickly find and add data fields.
* In addition to the data fields listed, you can also add own values to the export. The same value is then exported for each record.
* Add the option **Formula** to recalculate numerical values during the export. For example, you could update all exported variation prices during the export.
endif::file-export[]

ifdef::file-export[]
[#menu-added-fields]
==== Data fields added to export

To the right, the data fields that you can add to the export are shown. So these data fields will be exported to your file.
Before you select a data field, you can see the message “No data fields were selected”. In the screenshot, a few the fields are already selected.

image:data:catalogue-default-added-fields.png[]

*_Tips:_*

* You can move the data fields using drag-and-drop. This will change the order in which the data fields are exported.
* You can change the export key. The “Export Keys” are the names of the column headers, as they will appear in your export file. Every “Export Key” needs to be unique.
* You can add fallback data fields. If the data field is empty or invalid, the first fallback data field is checked and the value of that fallback data field is exported instead.
endif::file-export[]

ifdef::marketplace-export[]
[#menu-market-fields]
==== Marketplace data field

To the right of the navigation, all data fields available for the market are listed. Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk (✱).

image:data:catalogue-market-market-fields.png[]

*_Tip:_* In the toolbar, click on the further actions (material:more_vert[]) to show or hide optional data fields.
endif::marketplace-export[]

ifdef::marketplace-export[]
[#menu-plentymarkets-fields]
==== plentymarkets data fields

On the right side of the catalogue, you map the marketplace data fields to appropriate plentymarkets data fields.
Before you map the first data field, all you can see here is a whole lot of icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Add data field* buttons. That’s normal and as it should be.

image:data:catalogue-market-plenty-fields.png[]

*_Tip:_* One field was already mapped in the screenshot.
