.*No file is available through the catalogue’s download URL. Why?*
--

1. Is the catalogue active?
2. Has an export taken place? Check the export settings.
3. Did you use the right URL?

--

[.collapseBox]
.*The download URL leads to the message "Unauthenticated." instead of to file. Why?*
--
You used the admin URL. However, you are not logged into your plentymarkets system as an admin user.

1. Log in as an admin user.
2. Generate a public URL. The file can always be accessed with this URL.

.*Why can I not see the catalogues?*
--

People with xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#10[back end access rights] can only see catalogues if an admin gave them access.

. Find someone who has administrator rights for the plentymarkets system.
. This person will open the menu *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*.
. Then they will open your user account and activate the necessary rights:
  ** *Data > Data exchange > Export > Catalogue > Show*
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. If the problem persists, link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/c/importexport/multichannel/445[ask our support team for help in the forum^].
