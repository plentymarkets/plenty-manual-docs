|Setting |Explanation

| *CSS Class*

| *Alignment*
|Sets the alignment of the element to either left or right.

| *Appearance*
|Determines the background colour of the element. To change the colours, use the <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#205, Ceres design settings>>.

| *Select medium*
a|Determines the type of the element. The following options are available:

* Image
ifeval::["{type}" == "background-overlap"]
* Lottie
endif::[]
* Video

ifeval::["{type}" == "background-overlap"]
Lottie is a file format for animations. For further information on Lottie, refer to the link:https://lottiefiles.com/what-is-lottie[Lottie guide^].
endif::[]

| *Image selection*
|Selects the image from the webspace. For videos, the image is used as a thumbnail. If no image is selected, the widget uses the default thumbnail from Youtube.

ifeval::["{type}" == "background-overlap"]
| *Lottie.js JSON animation file*
|Selects the animation file from the webspace.
endif::[]

| *Video URL*
|Contains the URL of a Youtube video.

| *Show button*
|Toggles the button on or off.

| *Button label*
|Determines the text of the button label.

| *Button class*
|Determines the background colour of the button. To change the colours, use the <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#205, Ceres design settings>>.

| *Button link*
a|Determines the target of the link. The following types are available:

* *Category*
* *External link*
* *File (Webspace)*
* *Variation ID*

Check the option *Open in new tab* to open the target page in a new browser tab instead of the current one.

| *Preload image*
|If you activate this option, the image is prioritised when the page is loaded. You should only activate this option if you place the image in an area of the page that's initially visible.

| *Lazy loading*
|If you activate this option, the image is only loaded when the user navigates to the image. By using lazy loading for images that aren't initially visible, you can improve the overall loading speed of the page.

| *Edit padding*
|Determines the padding of the items the widget contains. In other words, this setting determines how far apart two items are. If you set the padding to *Auto*, it inherits the value from the element that contains the widget.

| *Edit margin*
|Determines the margin of the items the widget contains. In other words, this setting determines how far apart the widget is from other widgets. If you set the padding to *Auto*, it inherits the value from the element that contains the widget.
