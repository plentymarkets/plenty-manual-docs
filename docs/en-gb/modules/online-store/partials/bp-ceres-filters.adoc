In plentyShop LTS, filters are realized by means of attributes and properties. This Best Practice describes how the filter *Colour* with the two values *Red* and *Black* is displayed in the category view of plentyShop. The corresponding filters are only available in the category view if there are items that are linked to the filter values.

[NOTE]
.First things first:
====
* This is a Best Practice for the plentyShop plugin *plentyShop LTS*. *plentyShop LTS* is available in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[plentyMarketplace^] and runs on plentymarkets systems. The filters from *plentyShop LTS* are also displayed in individual theme plugins, as long as these themes did not overwrite them.
* The integration into individual or altered template plugins is possible. This, however, requires individual adjustments which cannot be considered here.
* Filters can be realized by means of xref:omni-channel:faceted-search.adoc#100[facets] through *attributes* and *properties*. This Best Practice exemplifies the setup of filters by means of *attributes*. Filters based on *properties* have to be setup manually. Create a *Property group* in which you organise properties of the type *None*. Properties are linked to facet values.
* For plentymarkets Zero systems, the *Setup » Client » Settings » Online store » Faceted search* menu is only activated in the central login.

== Creating an attribute

We begin with an attribute.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*.
. Click on *New attribute*.
. Enter the internal name, e.g. *Colour*.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The attribute is created and the tab *Basic settings* is displayed.
. Click on the *Name* tab.
. Enter the translations for your attribute.
. Click on the *Values* tab.
. Click on *New value*.
. Enter the internal name, e.g. *Red*.
. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the value *Black*.
. *Save* the settings.

The attribute with the two values *Red* and *Black* is created. You can also create additional values, such as *Vermilion* or *Burgundy*, and link them to the same *Red* facet.

== Linking an attribute with an item

You can link attributes with the main variation of an item when creating the item. When creating additional variations, you can link these variations with attribute values, too. You will now create variations in the *Variations* tab of the item. These variations have to be active in plentyShop, so that the filter will be available later on.

== Setting up facets

In plentyShop, our filters are realized by means of facets. Therefore we have to create a new facet and link the attribute values and the desired client to it.

. Go to *Systems » Client » Settings » Online store » Faceted search*.
. Click on *New* to create a new facet.
. Enter a *Name* for the facet in the default language of your system, e.g. *Colour*.
. Select the type *Attribute/Property*.
. Enter the facet’s position in plentyShop.
. *Save* the settings.

== Linking attribute values to facets

. Go to *Systems » Client » Settings » Online store » Faceted search*.
. Open the facet.
. Click on the *Name* tab.
. Enter the translation for your facet.
. Click on the *Values* tab.
. Click on *Add new value*.
. Enter the name, e.g. *Red*.
. Enter the position.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The facet value is added.
. Enter the translations for the facet value in th *Name* tab.
. Click on the *Link* tab.
. Open the attribute *Attribute » Colour » Red*.
. Click on *Link*.
. Repeat steps 6 to 13 for the value *Black*.
. *Save* the settings.

== Linking clients to facets

. Go to *Systems » Client » Select client » Online store » Facet links*.
. Select the facet.
. Click on *Link facet*. +
→ The facet is linked to the selected client.
. *Save* the settings.

== Deploying plugins

Now you will deploy the plugin set in order to apply the changes. The filters will be available in the *search* and in the *category view*.
