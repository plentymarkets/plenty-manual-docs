== General information

The CMS syntax supports several kinds of functions. These functions can either be used globally or within specific templates.

== Global Functions

This section describes the functions that are used in both the web design and email templates.

Some PHP functions have been integrated into the CMS syntax. Their usage corresponds to that directly in PHP.
