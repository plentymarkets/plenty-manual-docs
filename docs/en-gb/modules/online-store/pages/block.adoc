== General information about blocks

A block contains programming code and can also contain comments. For the xref:omni-channel:cms-syntax.adoc#basics-compiler[compiler] to process programming code, this code needs to be contained in a statement block. Blocks are inserted directly into existing templates. A block can wrap one or several lines of code. The structure of both variations is described below.

== Structure of single-line code blocks

A block is introduced by a left brace (*{*) followed by a percentage sign (*%*). The end of a block is defined using a percentage sign (*%*) followed by a right brace (*}*).

== Structure of multi-line code blocks

Multi-line code blocks are also wrapped by braces and percentage signs (*{% ... %}*). However, a multi-line block contains more than one statement. These statements are not separated by the beginning and end of a block. Instead, the individual statements of multi-line blocks are separated by a semicolon (*;*). if statements are wrapped by braces (*{ }*).

== Raw blocks

The parser does not check and translate the content of raw blocks. They are displayed in their raw format. Raw blocks need to have a start tag *{% raw %}* and an end tag *{% endraw %}*.

== Sections

Programming code can be used in *web design templates*, *categories* and *email templates*. Programming code that is inserted outside of a block will not be processed but printed instead.
