==  Sending an email to a customer once an item is available

Sometimes items are temporarily out of stock and can not be delivered. Customers should be allowed to save their email addresses if they are interested in purchasing an item that can not be delivered at the moment. The email address is then used to inform the customer once the item is back in stock. The email should only be sent once, rather than every time the item's net stock is positive. This case example demonstrates how all this is done.

==  Creating an email template

First, create an xref:omni-channel:cms-syntax.adoc#email-email[email template]. Once the item is back in stock, this email will be sent to all of the customers who saved their email addresses. Below, you will find a list of template variables and template functions that can be used for this email template. We also provide you with an example text, which you can customize as needed.

Possible template variables and template functions for an email template regarding item availability:

==  Linking an email template for automatic emailing

Now link the email template with the option *Notification when item is in stock*. Once the item is back in stock, the template is sent to all interested parties who saved their email addresses. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Linking an email template for automatic emailing:

. Go to *Setup » Assistants » Basic setup*.
. Open the *Email accounts* assistant.
. In the *Automatic despatch* step, select the email template from the drop-down list *Notification when item is in stock*.

==  Editing an inserting the example code for the form

Next you need to insert a form into your design. This form is displayed if an item can not be delivered. At minimum, this form should consist of an entry field and a button. Interested parties enter their email addresses into the field. By clicking on the button, the interested party agrees to receiving an email when the item becomes available. The REST call */rest/positive_stock_notification/* saves the email address and notifies all of the saved email addresses once the item's net stock is positive.

Further below, you will find an example code which is suited to our responsive design *Callisto Light*. Use this code as the basis for inserting the form in your design. Edit the code to meet your needs before you use it in your online store. Proceed as described below to insert the example code in your design.

[.instruction]
Inserting example code into the design:

.  Edit the example code to adjust it to your requirements.
.  Copy the code to the clipboard (*Ctrl + C* or *Cmd + C*).
.  Go to *CMS » Web design » Layout » ItemView » ItemViewSingleItem*.
.  Insert the code example at an appropriate position of the template.
