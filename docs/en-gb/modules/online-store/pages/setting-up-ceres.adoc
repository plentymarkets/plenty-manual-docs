In plentyShop, design and logic are separated from each other. The shop is integrated into your plentymarkets system via 2 plugins.
The *plentyShop LTS* plugin contains plentyShop's standard design and can be customised to meet your needs. The link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/templates/IO_4696[IO^] plugin contains the logic of plentyShop, is a general basis for all design plugins and can also be used by other plugins.
