The ShopBuilder is plentymarkets’ modular construction kit for quickly setting up your link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[plentyShop LTS^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] via drag-and-drop. You require no programming skills. +
The ShopBuilder consists of 2 user interfaces: the content manager and the editor. The *content manager* is the user interface in which you manage ShopBuilder categories and individual contents for these categories, e.g. for creating season-dependent homepages. The *editor* is the view in which you design individual pages and carry out the settings of the widgets on your pages. +

.Requirements for the ShopBuilder

== The content manager

You open the content manager view by opening the **CMS » ShopBuilder** menu. The content manager serves to manage ShopBuilder categories and adding new contents. This section provides an overview over the functions of the content manager; the individual functions are elaborated later on.

|====
|Mark |Element |Explanation

|1
| *Open setting*
|Opens the interface for linking categories to the plentyShop LTS plugin. Here, you link the categories you created for *displaying information about shipping costs*, the *checkout* and the *My Account* area, so that these categories are correctly connected to the *plentyShop LTS* plugin.

|2
| *Regenerate contents*
|If an update of the *plentyShop LTS* plugin includes changes to already existing widgets, this button serves to generate the contents of these widgets again, so that your ShopBuilder contents are displayed correctly after installing the update. If it is necessary to regenerate the contents, we will include a warning in our ink:https://github.com/plentymarkets/plugin-ceres/blob/stable/meta/documents/changelog_de.md[Changelog^] under the header *TODO*.

|3
| *Select a plugin set*
|You can create and manage different ShopBuilder contents for different plugin sets. Select the plugin set from the drop-down list for which you want to edit the ShopBuilder contents. You should always make sure that the correct plugin set is selected when you edit a category or create a new content.

|4
| *Select a language*
|You can create and manage different ShopBuilder contents for different languages. Select the language from the drop-down list for which you want to edit the ShopBuilder contents. It is possible to create homepages with different languages independently of one another. You should always make sure that the correct language is selected when you edit a content. All plentymarkets system languages are available. The language has to be activated in the **Plugins » Plugin overview » plentyShop LTS » Configuration » Languages** menu.

|5
| *Select client (store)*
|If you operate more than one plentyShop via a single plentymarkets system, you can select the client for which you want to edit contents from the *Select client* drop-down list.

|6
| *Category selection*
|The category tree on the left side of the category view lists the categories that you can use in the ShopBuilder. Usually, you would have at least one category for the *homepage*, the *My Account* area, the *checkout*, and your *shipping cost information*. You can also create categories for content pages, such as a *About us* page. As soon as item and category pages can be managed via the ShopBuilder, this list will also include categories of the type item.

|7
| *Header elements*
|In this area, you create and edit new contents for the header. At the moment, the header you create is globally active for all pages that have been created with the ShopBuilder. The same thing applies to the *footer elements*. _*Note*_: This section is collapsed by default.

|8
| *New*
|Clicking the *New* button creates a new page for the currently selected category. You can select one of the 3 types *Content*, *Checkout*, and *My Account*. *Content* pages are used for the homepage and additional static pages, such as a *About us* page. You select the type *Checkout* for setting up your order process. The type *My Account* is used for setting up your customer area. After clicking *New*, you can enter a name for the page and select whether you want to use a *preset* for the page. +

You create new contents for the *header* and *footer* in the same way.

|9
| *Content*
|Every tile represents a page that you created. You need to *activate* the created page if you want to display it in your plentyShop. You *activate* a page by clicking the eye icon on the page’s tile. The tooltip reads *activate* upon mouseover.
