[#shopbuilder-intro]
ShopBuilder is plentymarkets’ modular construction kit for quickly setting up your link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[plentyShop LTS^] via drag-and-drop. You require no programming skills. +

ShopBuilder consists of 2 user interfaces: the content manager and the editor. The *content manager* is the user interface in which you manage ShopBuilder categories and individual contents for these categories, e.g. for creating seasonal homepages. The *editor* is the view in which you design individual pages and carry out the settings of the widgets on your pages. +

[#content-manager]
== Shopbuilder’s content manager

The first thing you see when opening the **CMS » ShopBuilder** menu is the content manager of the ShopBuilder. This is where you manage categories and add **new contents**. A content is an online shop page you design. In the category view you can create, copy, and delete contents. Below, you’ll find an overview of the features of ShopBuilder’s content manager.

[[image-ContentManager-ui]]

* The top bar (highlighted in blue) contains the **global settings**, the **Regenerate all contents** button, the **plugin set selection**, the **language selection**, the **client selection** as well as the safe mode (icon:lock[role="darkGrey"]).
* The area highlighted in orange is the *Category tree*. Here, you can access categories and create and edit new subcategories via the context menu (icon:ellipsis-v[role="darkGrey"]).
* In the area highlighted in red you can manage contents for your shop. You can create, edit, and delete contents for header, footer, and main body of the page. Additionally, you can set the **visibility** of your contents and can see at a glance which content was last edited at what time.

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Global settings*
|Opens the UI for linking categories to plentyShop pages. Here, you link categories for specific pages (e.g. checkout, My Account, ...) so that these are correctly displayed by *plentyShop LTS*.

| *Regenerate contents*
|If a *plentyShop LTS* update contains changes to already existing widgets, you can use this button to regenerate all widgets in all contents at once to effect the changes on these contents. That way, your ShopBuilder contents will be correctly displayed after the update. If it is necessary to regenerate contents, we will highlight it in our  link:https://github.com/plentymarkets/plugin-ceres/blob/stable/meta/documents/changelog_en.md[Changelog^] under the header *TODO*.

| *Select plugin set*
|You can create and manage different ShopBuilder contents for different plugin sets. Select the plugin set from the drop-down list for which you want to edit the ShopBuilder contents. You should always make sure that the correct plugin set is selected when you edit a category or create a new content. The active plugin set is highlighted in green.

| *Select language*
|You can create and manage different ShopBuilder contents for different languages. Select the language from the drop-down list for which you want to edit the ShopBuilder contents. It is possible to create homepages with different languages independently of one another. You should always make sure that the correct language is selected when you edit a content. All plentymarkets system languages are available. The language has to be activated in the **Plugins » Plugin overview » plentyShop LTS » Configuration » Languages** menu.

| *Client selection*
|If you operate more than one online store via a single plentymarkets system, you can select the client for which you want to edit ShopBuilder contents from the *Select client* drop-down list.

| *Safe mode*
|The toggle *Safe mode* serves to access the ShopBuilder and the online store without any external contents. External contents include plugins, such as themes, that are included in the plugin set in addition to plentyShop LTS and IO. The safe mode makes it easier to reliably identify the source of an error. Layout containers filled via container links are also not output in the safemode.

|====

[#category-tree]
=== Category tree

The category tree on the left displays all item and content categories at a glance. Item categories are displayed with a grey tag icon (icon:tag[role="darkGrey"]); content categories are displayed with a yellow file icon (icon:tag[role="darkGrey"]). You can expand parent categories by clicking the chevron left of the category name (icon:chevron-right[role="darkGrey"]) in order to reveal subcategories. +

Categories that are inactive for the selected client are displayed on **grey**.
Categories that are inactive for the selected language are displayed in **cursive**.
Additionally, a tooltip is displayed upon mouseover; the tooltip shows the category’s ID and whether it’s active or inactive. +

The category tree contains 2 buttons: The green button **New category** at the lower end of the tree and the button for opening the context menu (icon:ellipsis-v[role="darkGrey"]), which is displayed upon mouseover. Via the context menu, you can **edit categories**, **Create subcategories**, and **delete categories**.

|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Caption type*
|Select either *default title*, *custom title*, or *no title*. The colour of the title depends on the selected *appearance*. +

==== Background image:

This widget provides an image box in which you can display individual images that can link to categories or variations. Click *Edit* icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] to open the widget settings. +

[[table-background-image]]
.Settings background image
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| **CSS class**
|Add additional CSS classes to customise the widget’s style. You can add any number of CSS classes.

| *Full screen width*
|Activate this option to upsize the background image to the screen size, independent of image size.

| *Increase font size*
|Activate this option to increase the font size of widgets of the widget category *Text* that have been placed in the background image widget.

|*Fix in background*
|Activate this option to fix the background image. If this option is inactive, the image scrolls down when a user scrolls down the page.

|*Colour*
|Select a colour from the drop-down list. The colour is used as the background if no image has been selected for the background widget. If an image has been selected that is smaller than the widget container, the selected colour fills the remaining space. You define the available colour options in the <<#design, Design>> menu.

|*Background image*
|Select the image you want to use as the background image. If you select the option *None*, only the selected *colour* will be used to fill out the background container. The options *Category image 1* and *Category image 2* use the images stored in the category settings of the current category. If you select the option *Custom image*, the image selection is displayed, via which you can upload an image file.

|*Image scaling*
|Select the way in which the selected image is supposed to scale in relation to the screen. Select *Oriented on long side of the image* to scale the selected image to the entire size of the image container, even if parts of the image get cut off in the process. This corresponds to the CSS statement *cover*. Select *Oriented on short side of the image* to always display the image in full, if if this means that it does not completely fill out the background container. This corresponds to the CSS statement *contain*

|*Repeat image*
|Activate this image to continually repeat the image at the end of the background image widget. If this option is inactive, the selected image is only displayed once.

|*Opacity*
|Use the slider to determine the opacity of the selected image. The value 0 fades the image completely.

|*Minimum height*
|Select the background image widget’s minimum height. If you select the option *None*, the background image widget assumes the height of the contained content, i.e. other widgets. The options *xs* to *xl* increase the minimum height to above the height of the contained widgets. The option *Auto* ensures that a background image widget in a grid widget assumes the height of the largest widget contained in the same grid widget.   If the background image widget is not placed in a grid image, the option *Auto* has the same effect as the option *None*.

| *Lazy load the background image*
| Activate to load images that are located in the non-visible area upon page access at a later time. This reduces the initial loading time of the page, thereby improving plentyShop performance. Do not activate this setting for images that are located in the area that is initially visible on the page. You can find additional information about how to use Lazy Loading in our xref:webshop:best-practices.adoc#psi.adoc[PageSpeed Insights Best Practice].
