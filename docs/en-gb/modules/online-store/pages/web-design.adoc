Validators check the details customers enter before these are saved. As soon as the order process data is submitted, the relevant validator template is called. For example, if the invoice address is submitted, the template ValidatorCustomerInvoiceAddress is called. If the customer did not fill in any fields of the invoice address that were defined as mandatory in the template, the respective error messages are returned. The data is not saved while error messages are still returned.
