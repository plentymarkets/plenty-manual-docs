== for loop

for loops can be applied by defining a counter variable and a number range. Alternatively, an iteration can be performed through an <<omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients/_cms-syntax/basics/types#6, array>>.

== Number range

For this variation, a counter variable (in this case$_i) and then a number range (in this case from 1 to 10) need to be defined:

This variation is optional and can e.g. be used to display item images. Item images are made available within the templates as arrays.

If you have saved more than one but no more than five images for some items, the following loop is an interesting option for displaying images:
