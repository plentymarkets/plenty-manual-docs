:description: Displaying item variants dynamically in the online store with surcharges and attribute images
:position: 10020

plentymarkets allows you to assign items to individual attributes. These attributes are then used to create item variations. The individual characteristics of item variations, such as the surcharges and attribute images, can be displayed visually and dynamically in the online store. This means that the displayed information and images will automatically change depending on what is selected.

[IMPORTANT]
.Carry out the settings in all of the relevant templates
====
In order for the dynamic display to function in all of the layouts, you have to carry out the steps described below in all of the relevant templates. For example, the dynamic display will only be applied to the search results list if you have also edited the template under *CMS » Web design » Layout » ItemView » ItemViewSearchResultsList*.
====

== Inserting template variables for displaying attributes

The *$AttributeSelect* template variable displays an item's attributes as a dropdown menu. Use the template variable *$ImageAttributeList* to display the attributes of an item not only in a drop-down list but also in a list of preview images. The options in the drop-down list will be adjusted dynamically. Use the features *Dynamic item price* and *Dynamic item images* as well. In order for the template variable *$ImageAttributeList* to be effective, you need to assign the attributes to images.

Proceed as described below to insert the template variables. Here you can find examples for inserting template variables into the *ItemViewSingleItem* template. However, the same process is used in all other areas where the template variable *$AttributeSelect* can be inserted.

[.instruction]
Inserting template variables:

. Go to *CMS » Web design » Layout » ItemView » ItemViewSingleItem*.
. Insert the template variables *$AttributeSelect* and *$ImageAttributeList* into the template.

== Displaying the item prices dynamically

To display a dynamic item price, replace the template variable *$Price* with *$PriceDynamic* in the template *ItemViewSingleItem*. By using the template variable *$PriceDynamic*, the display of the item price will be adjusted depending on the selected attribute. In order for the item price to be adjusted, items have to be assigned to attributes with suchrcharges. Proceed as described below to display the item price dynamically.

====
Go to xref:omni-channel:item-layouts.adoc#[Setup » Client » Select client » Item layouts » Settings] in order to deactivate the display of surcharges. Choose the setting *Do not show* for the option *Attribute surcharge*.
====

== Displaying item images dynamically

Carry out the following steps in order to display item images dynamically.

=== Activating the image link

If you want the displayed xref:item:managing-items.adoc#460[item image] to match the selected attribute, then activate the *Image link* option for the attributes. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Activating the image link:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*.
. Click on the *plus icon* in front of the attribute that you would like to edit.
. Activate the *Image link*.
. Check whether the necessary attributes were assigned to the desired items and whether the attributes were linked to the item images.

=== Activating the client check

Now activate the xref:omni-channel:item-layouts.adoc#[client check] in order to display the attribute images dynamically.

=== Carrying out layout settings

Go to *CMS » Web design » Layout » ItemView » ItemViewSingleItem*. Check whether the template variable *$AttributeSelect* is included in the template. Also add the following *JavaScript* to the template. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Inserting the code for displaying attribute images into the web design:

. Go to *CMS » Web design » Layout » ItemView » ItemViewSingleItem*.
. Make sure that the template variable *$AttributeSelect* was entered into the template.
. Insert the JavaScript displayed above into the template.
. Edit the value of the variable *dynamic_article_image* if you do not want images to be displayed with medium resolution. Replace the value *"middle"* with *"preview"* if you want preview images to be displayed. Replace it with *"normal"* if you want images to be displayed in the highest resolution.
. Your choice depends on which type of preview image you have selected. You can tell which type was selected by looking at the variable for the item image.

Following is an image of an example code, which contains the JavaScript in lines 5 - 7 and the template variable in line 21.

[TIP]
.Dynamic images
====
Dynamic images are also available to you. They can be found by going to *CMS » Web design » Layout » ItemView » ItemViewCategoriesList*.
====

=== Assigning more than one image per variation

You can link more than one image to a variation's attribute value. This is done in the item's *Images* tab. In order for the images to be correctly displayed in the ItemViewSingleItem layout, the preview images have to be in a DIV container with the ID *PlentyDynamicPreviewImagesContainer*. Furthermore, the images have to be positioned within an a-tag and given the structure shown below:
