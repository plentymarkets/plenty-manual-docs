== General information

Template variables are similar to private variables. However, template variables differ in the following ways:

* The first character of template variables is always a dollar sign ($) followed directly by a capital letter.
* Template variables are predefined variables that can be used in specific templates. As soon as you insert a template variable into a template, it is automatically filled with the relevant content.
* The content of template variables can not be overwritten or changed in any way. To manipulate the content, you need to assign it to a private variable.

== Validity

There are two different types of template variables:

*Global template variables* can be used in all templates. Global template variables are only available for web design and categories. You can find these variables in the _Global_ section of the template variables and functions overview.

*Template variables* that are assigned to a specific template are *only valid within this template*. If such a template variable is used in a different template, it can either not be translated or not filled with the correct content.
