To make sure that you don’t have to select a filter that you use quite often from the list of your <<#apply-saved-filters, saved filters>> every time when opening the *{menu-path}* menu, you can set a created filter as default filter. Every time when you open the *{menu-path}*, this filter will be automatically applied.

You can set the filter as default filter directly when creating it as described in <<#save-current-filter, Saving the current filter>> or you can set the filter as default in the overview afterwards.

[.instruction]
Setting a default filter:

. Go to *{menu-path}*.
. In the line of the saved filter, click on icon:star_border[set=material] *Set as default*.
. If you want to set another filter as default filter, deactivate the currently selected default filter by clicking on icon:star[set=material] *Do not use as default*. +
→ The next time you open the menu, the default filter will be applied automatically.

[TIP]
Use drag-and-drop to arrange the filters in a specific order by clicking on *Move* (icon:drag_indicator[set=material]). Click on icon:delete[set=material] to delete a filter.
