Sticking rows in view sets make it possible for you to make rows stick at the top of your view set. That way, you can make important rows stick at the top in larger view sets and don’t lose track of figures that are important to you. You can make as many rows stick as you want. Only if you scroll past them, they will stick at the top. Every sticky row can be unsticked at any time.
