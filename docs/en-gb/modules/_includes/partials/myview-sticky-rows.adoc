Sticking rows in view sets make it possible for you to make rows stick at the top of your view set. That way, you can make important rows stick at the top in larger view sets and don't lose track of figures that are important to you. You can make any amount of rows stick. Only when you scroll past a row it will stick on top. Every sticky row can be unsticked at any time.
