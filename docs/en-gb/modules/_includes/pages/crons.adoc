.What is a cron?
--
A cron is used to run processes based on a schedule. These are run in individual cron jobs.

So cron jobs are recurring tasks (jobs) that start automatically in set intervals. These intervals are usually specified in minutes. So for example, a "cron 60" runs every 60 minutes.

*_Example:_* Item data is exported to a market once per day. To do that, a "cron 1440" is used. Each export is its own cron job.

Fun fact: Cron stands for "Command Run On Notice". However, the term also alludes to Chronos, the Greek god of time.

Why you need to know what a cron is? Well, actually you don't need to know that at all. All you do is activate the data exchange in plentymarkets. The rest happens automatically. Awesome, right?
