! *HTML*
!A text with formatting can be displayed in the plentyShop.
Appropriate e.g. for creating variation-specific product descriptions.

*_Note_*: This type of property is language-specific.

*_Example of use_*: +
Imagine you sell headphones.
Some of the headphones have a built-in microphone.

! *Multi selection*
!Appropriate for situations where there are multiple choices and several of them apply to the variation.

*_Example of use_*: +
Imagine you sell Bluetooth headphones.
There are many different Bluetooth profiles.
Some of your headphones support all of the profiles, and others support just one or two profiles.
You want to specify which profiles each pair of headphones support, e.g. "Bluetooth profiles: A2DP, AVRCP, HFP, HSP".

. xref:item:properties.adoc#property-selection-values[First]: Create the various options, i.e. all of the Bluetooth profiles.
. xref:item:properties.adoc#1400[Second]: While you link the property to your variations, you’ll specify which headphones support which profiles.
