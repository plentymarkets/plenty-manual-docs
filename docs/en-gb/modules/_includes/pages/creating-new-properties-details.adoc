*_Example of use_*: +
Imagine you sell headphones.
Some of the headphones have a built-in microphone.

//. xref:item:frontend-item-search.adoc#[Third] you’ll create online store filters, which allow your customers to search for variations with a specific water resistance level.

! *Multi selection*
!Appropriate for situations where there are multiple choices and several of them apply to the variation. +
*_Important:_* Properties of the type *Multi selection* are not supported by plentyShop LTS.

Imagine you sell Bluetooth headphones.
There are many different Bluetooth profiles.
Some of your headphones support all of the profiles, and others support just one or two profiles.
