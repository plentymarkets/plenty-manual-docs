Note that only *Admins* can grant rights.

[.instruction]
Assigning rights:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*. +
→ The user accounts are displayed in an overview.
. Click on a user account. +
→ The *Rights* menu item containing the visibilities opens.
. Assign the rights for the respective area by ticking the check boxes indicated above. +
*_Note_*: You can either grant rights for complete areas or limit the rights you grant the user. To only grant limited rights in a certain area, expand the area.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
======
The *Rights* and *Menu visibilities* are linked. This means that if you grant a right in one of the two areas, plentymarkets automatically grants the corresponding rights in the other area.
