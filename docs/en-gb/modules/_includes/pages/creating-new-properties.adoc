*_Note_*: The type of property is language-specific.
In other words, the text is saved separately for each language.

*_Example of use_*: +
Imagine you sell Bluetooth headphones.
There are many different Bluetooth profiles.
Some of your headphones support all of the profiles, and others support just one or two profiles.
You want to specify which profiles each pair of headphones support, e.g. "Bluetooth profiles: A2DP, AVRCP, HFP, HSP".

! *No taxation*
!Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if _VAT should not be calculated_ for the surcharge that was entered.

One possible application is e.g. displaying bottle deposits, which are added to the item price without VAT.
//Characteristics that have this option selected will be displayed as separate items on invoices etc. These items will be displayed with the ID -2.

! *Tax rate from variation*
!Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if _the same VAT_ should be calculated for the surcharge as for the variation.

The exact value of the surcharge is displayed separately.

The exact value of the surcharge is not mentioned separately.

! *Display as multiline input*
!This option is relevant for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties].
This option controls what type of input field your customers will see in the plentyShop, e.g. when they enter the text that should be engraved on an item.

icon:check-square[role="blue"] = A multi-line input field will be displayed.

icon:square-o[role="blue"] = A single-line input field will be displayed.

*_Note_*: This option does not work in the plentyShop yet.

! *Order property*
!Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if the property should be treated as an order property.
xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[What are order properties]?

*_Note_*:
Not all property types are compatible with order properties.
If customers should be able to enter a text (e.g. for engraved items), then you will need to select the type "Character string".
The types "HTML" and "Text" are not compatible with order properties.

! *Pre-selected*
!This option is relevant for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties].

icon:check-square[role="blue"] = The order property is pre-selected in the plentyShop.

icon:square-o[role="blue"] = The order property is not pre-selected in the plentyShop.

! *Required*
!This option is relevant for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties].

icon:check-square[role="blue"] = Customers must select the order property before they can place the item in the shopping cart.

icon:square-o[role="blue"] = Customers can place the item in the shopping cart without having selected the order property.

*_Example of use_*:
This option helps sellers comply with the new German sales laws that went into effect on January 1st, 2022.
The most important change resulting from this law for online shop processes is the shortening of the period of warranty for used goods and the explicit and separate agreement of "defects" in the purchase contract.
This option allows sellers to make an "explicit and separate agreement" with customers directly on an item's product page.
The order property's text can state that the customer accepts possible defects as well as a shortened period of warranty.
The customer has to agree for every item separately.
This allows sellers to simultaneously sell both new and used products.

|Do you want to offer this property for an additional fee?
For example, surcharges can be used for:

* Additional options and services that customers can choose while placing orders.
* Deposits on glass bottles

Enter a value here if a surcharge is to be added for the property.
Surcharges will automatically be added to the item price in the detailed view of an item and in the order process.
