*_Note_*: The drop-down list only includes active referrers.
So if you can’t find a specific market in the list, then open the menu *Setup » Orders » Order referrer* and make sure the market was activated (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

| *Client*
|Should the property only apply to specific clients (stores)? If so, then select all of the clients (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that this property should apply to.
Enter a word into the search bar to narrow down the results in real time.

*_Background info_*: With plentysystems, you can manage several online stores, i.e. xref:online-store:setting-up-clients.adoc#[several clients], with only one software. Consequently, it is possible to manage several different areas of business with one system. That’s a great advantage. But it also means that you’ll always need to tell plentysystems which online store the property applies to.

| *Display everywhere*
|Where should the property be displayed? Choose the areas (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) where your customers should see the property.
