(No effect on plentyShop)
|Is the property something like a weight or a length, e.g. a HDMI cable that is 10m long?
Select the appropriate xref:item:units.adoc#[unit] from the drop-down list.

*_Note_*: Selecting a unit has no effect on the plentyShop.
Instead, give the property a meaningful name, e.g. "Cable length (in metres)".

! *No taxation*
!Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if _VAT should not be calculated_ for the surcharge that was entered.

One possible application is e.g. displaying bottle deposits, which are added to the item price without VAT.
//Characteristics that have this option selected will be displayed as separate items on invoices etc. These items will be displayed with the ID -2.

! *Tax rate from variation*
!Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if _the same VAT_ should be calculated for the surcharge as for the variation.

You can see which VAT rate is saved for the variation by opening the menu xref:item:managing-items#280[Item » Edit item » [Open variation\] » Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Drop-down list: VAT].

! *Tax rate A, B, C, D*
!Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if _a specific VAT rate_ should be applied to the surcharge that was entered.

You can find the individual VAT rates in the menu xref:orders:accounting.adoc#550[Setup » Client » [Select client\] » Locations » [Select location\] » Accounting » Tab: VAT rates » [Open configuration\]].

! *Display as multi-line input* +
(Not currently functional)
!This option is intended for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties].
Currently, this option is not functional.
In the future, this option will control what type of input field your customers will see in the plentyShop, e.g. when they enter the text that should be engraved on an item.

//if this option ever does something in the future, then delete the text above and display the text below instead

//This option is relevant for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties].
//This option controls what type of input field your customers will see in the plentyShop, e.g. when they enter the text that should be engraved on an item.

//icon:check-square[role="blue"] = A multi-line input field will be displayed.

//icon:square-o[role="blue"] = A single-line input field will be displayed.

! *Order property* +
!Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if the property should be treated as an order property.
xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[What are order properties]?

*_Note_*:
Not all property types are compatible with order properties.
If customers should be able to enter a text (e.g. for engraved items), then you will need to select the type "Character string".
The types "HTML" and "Text" are not compatible with order properties.

! *Required*
!This option is relevant for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties].

icon:check-square[role="blue"] = Customers must select the order property before they can place the item in the shopping cart.

icon:square-o[role="blue"] = Customers can place the item in the shopping cart without having selected the order property.

*_Example of use_*:
This option helps sellers comply with the new German sales laws that went into effect on January 1st, 2022.
The most important change resulting from this law for online shop processes is the shortening of the period of warranty for used goods and the explicit and separate agreement of "defects" in the purchase contract.
This option allows sellers to make an "explicit and separate agreement" with customers directly on an item’s product page.
The order property’s text can state that the customer accepts possible defects as well as a shortened period of warranty.
The customer has to agree for every item separately. This allows sellers to simultaneously sell both new and used products.

! *Pre-selected*
!This option is relevant for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties].

icon:check-square[role="blue"] = The order property is pre-selected in the plentyShop.

icon:square-o[role="blue"] = The order property is not pre-selected in the plentyShop.

! *Display as additional costs*
!This option is relevant for xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[order properties].

//stimmt das überhaupt, es ist nur eine Mutmaßung.
icon:check-square[role="blue"] = The surcharge is added to the total.
The exact value of the surcharge is displayed separately.

icon:square-o[role="blue"] = The surcharge is added to the total.
The exact value of the surcharge is not mentioned separately.

!===

| *Surcharge*
|Do you want to offer this property for an additional fee?
For example, surcharges can be used for:

* Additional options and services that customers can choose while placing orders.
* Deposits on glass bottles

Enter a value here if a surcharge is to be added for the property.
Surcharges will automatically be added to the item price in the detailed view of an item and in the order process.
//The value 0.00 is set by default, i.e. no surcharge will be calculated.
