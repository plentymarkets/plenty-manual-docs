Some items like shoes and t-shirts are sold in various sizes and colours.
In plentymarkets, such characteristics are called attributes.
Attributes help you simultaneously characterise your products and create xref:item:structure.adoc#[saleable variations], e.g. the t-shirt in the colour red and the size S.

== Creating attributes manually

First, create attributes like colour or size.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New attribute*.
. Enter an internal name.
. Click on terra:save[role="green"] *Save*. +
→ The attribute is created and the tab *Basic settings* is displayed.
. Carry out the settings in all of the tabs.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#120]
=== Tab: Basic settings

[cols="1,4a"]

Upload an image here (terra:upload[role="purple"]) if you want to visually display the attribute value.

*_Additional settings_*:

* In the basic settings, specify that this attribute should be selected with an image.
* Optionally, enter the maximum image size.

These steps are described in further detail xref:item:attributes.adoc#700[in another chapter].

| *Position*
|Which attribute value should be displayed in the plentyShop first, second, third, etc?
Enter a position number into this field.
The attribute values will be displayed in ascending order according to their position number.

| *Name*
|Enter a name for the attribute value (e.g. “Red”, “Blue” or “Green”).
This name will be visible in your plentyShop.

*_Multilingualism_*:
If your shop is available in multiple languages, then you can enter translations of the name here.

//tag::steps-attribute-value-name-translations[]

. Select a language from the *Show language* drop-down list in the header. +
→ Only the text in the *Name* column will change.
. In the *Name* column, enter the attribute values in the selected language.

//end::steps-attribute-value-name-translations[]

| *Name (internal)*
|Unique name of the attribute value. The internal name is only used in the plentymarkets back end and is not visible in the plentyShop. The internal name can only be assigned once per attribute. The internal name must not contain the following characters, otherwise errors may occur while exchanging data: +

* Comma
* Colon
* Semicolon
* Quotation marks

| *Note*
|Enter an optional note about the attribute value.

*_Tip_*: The note is for internal use only.
The text does not appear in the plentyShop.

| *Percentage*
|Enter the percentages for the automatic distribution of attribute values.
When reordering an item, the quantities of attribute values will automatically be distributed among the total quantity.

*_Note:_* Automatic distribution only takes effect for items with exactly two attribute values.

[#500]
=== Tab: Attribute link

Some markets, such as xref:markets:preparing-variations.adoc#1350[Amazon] and xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#6100[eBay], require you to link your own attribute values with their attribute values.
For example, imagine you sell a turquoise t-shirt. But the market you want to sell it on only accepts the colours green and blue. Link your own attribute values with the ones on the other market. This ensures that your items are displayed correctly.

[TIP]
.Additional settings
====
Should the item image change, e.g. on eBay, depending on which size or colour a customer chooses?
Some markets, such as eBay, require you to also xref:item:attributes.adoc#900[link your variation images with the appropriate attribute values].
====

[#160]
== Creating attributes via import

plentymarkets has an xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool], which you can use to import attributes.
The idea is simple.
Rather than manually saving attribute data in plentymarkets, you’ll enter the same information into a CSV file and then import this file into your system.

. Create attributes (like colour and size) and attribute values (like blue, red, green and S, M, L).
You can do this with the import type xref:data:elasticSync-attributes.adoc#[Attribute].

. Use the attributes to generate variations.
You can do this with the import type xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#2380[Item].
See a xref:item:import.adoc#[practical example including video] to learn how variations are generated.

[TIP]
.Attributes can also be exported
====
* Use the format type xref:data:formatdesigner-attributes.adoc#[Attribute] to export information about the attributes and attribute values.
* Use the format type xref:data:formatdesigner-item.adoc#900[Item / VariationAttributeValues] to see which attribute values are linked with a specific variation.
====

[#300]
== Generating variations

An item’s first variation is called its main variation.
If an item has multiple variations, then the main variation can either be a saleable product or it can be a virtual data record. A virtual main variation is used to manage the other variations of the item with xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inheritance].
How exactly you’ll proceed depends on whether the main variation should be for sale or not.

[tabs]
====
Main variation is not for sale::
+
--
Imagine you sell a t-shirt in the sizes S, M, L and XL.
The main variation is not for sale and it doesn’t correspond to any of these sizes.
The main variation is simply a data container used to manage prices, categories and other product settings.

. xref:item:new-item.adoc#200[First create the item] without selecting any attributes.
This will create the main variation without any attributes.
. Then choose the attributes while you xref:item:new-item.adoc#400[create the necessary variations].

--
Main variation is for sale::
+
--
Imagine you sell a t-shirt in the sizes S, M, L and XL.
The main variation is for sale and corresponds to one of these sizes, e.g. S.

. xref:item:new-item.adoc#200[First create the item] and choose the appropriate attribute value, e.g. the size S.
The main variation will be created with this attribute value.
. Then choose the remaining attributes while you xref:item:new-item.adoc#400[create the other variations].

--
====

[#1100]
== Deleting attributes

Before you can delete an attribute, you have to delete all of the variations that are linked with this attribute.
The xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#300[variation group function] is a useful tool for doing so.

[.instruction]
Deleting variations linked to an attribute:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Set the filters on the left as follows:
.. Set the filter xref:item:search.adoc#intable-table-type[Table type] to *Variations*.
.. Set the filter xref:item:search.adoc#intable-active[Active] to *ALL*.
.. Use the xref:item:search.adoc#intable-all[ALL] filter to select the attribute from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ All variations linked with this attribute are displayed.
. Select all of the variations (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on *Variation group function*. +
→ The *Variation group function* window opens.
. In the *Procedures* area, select the option *Delete variations* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on terra:execute[role="darkGrey"] *Execute*. +
→ The variations are deleted. +
→ The attribute can now be deleted.

[.instruction]
Deleting an attribute:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*.
. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]) in the line of an attribute. +
→ A new window opens.
. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]) again to confirm your decision. +
→ The attribute is deleted.

.*Characteristics, properties and attributes: what’s the difference?*

//könnte hilfreich sein als Erklärung Eigenschaft vs Attribute nachdem die Merkmale wegfallen
//Merkmale und Eigenschaften sind passive Charakteristiken eines Artikels. Das heißt, dass sie nicht an den Warenbestand gekoppelt sind.
//Attribute hingegen erzeugen verkaufbare Varianten, die alle unterschiedliche Lagerbestände haben können. Beispielsweise kann die rote Variante ausverkauft sein, während die blaue noch auf Lager ist.


//tag::faq-attribute-property-characteristic[]

* xref:item:attributes.adoc#[Attributes], for example, are the various colours and sizes that your products are available in.
Attributes help you simultaneously characterise your products and create saleable variations, e.g. a t-shirt in the colour red and the size S.
* Characteristics and properties define products without simultaneously creating saleable variations:
** xref:item:properties.adoc#100[Characteristics] define entire items.
For example, if an item is available in red, blue or green, then the characteristic will apply to all three variations.
Characteristics aren’t very flexible, they’re outdated and they’re gradually being replaced by properties.
** xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Properties] define specific variations.
For example, if an item is available in red, blue or green, then the property can apply to one, two or all three of the variations.
Therefore, properties are much more flexible.

.*Can I retroactively add attributes to my variations?*
--

//tag::faq-add-attribute-existing-item[]

Once you have added attributes to an item, you can no longer add even more attributes to it.
You can only add new values to the existing attributes.

*_Example_*:
Imagine you sell a t-shirt with the attributes size and colour.
Specifically, the t-shirt is available in the variations “Red/S”, “Red/L”, “Blue/S” and “Blue/L”.

* *_What’s possible_*:
You could add new colour and size variations.
For example, you could add the variations “Green/S” and “Green/L”.
* *_What’s not possible_*:
You can not bring new attributes into play.
For example, you can not add the attribute “Material” retroactively.
In this case, we recommend creating a new item so that you don’t run into any problems with pending orders and existing stock levels.
