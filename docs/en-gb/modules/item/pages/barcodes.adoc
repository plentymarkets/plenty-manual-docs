Barcodes are used to uniquely identify items.
They are often displayed e.g. on item labels or on documents like invoices and delivery notes.
This pages helps you configure barcodes step by step in plentymarkets.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

This function is configured in several different steps:

* xref:item:barcodes.adoc#100[Configure the barcode types]: +
Specify whether you need GTIN, ISBN, UPC or QR barcodes and which sales platforms you need the barcodes for.
* xref:item:barcodes.adoc#200[Acquire a pool of barcodes if needed]: +
If you don’t get barcodes directly from your manufacturer, i.e. if you sell your own brand of products, then you’ll need to acquire the actual barcodes from an organisation like GS1.
For example, you might buy a range of 1000 barcode numbers.
You’ll tell plentymarkets which barcodes you’ve bought by saving information about the number range.
* xref:item:barcodes.adoc#300[Assign the barcodes to your items]: +
In other words, you’ll link your barcodes to your item variations.
* Decide where you want the barcodes to be displayed: +
For example, if you want to display barcodes on item labels, then you’ll need to xref:item:barcodes.adoc#900[design the labels] and xref:item:barcodes.adoc#1000[print them out].

[#100]
== Configuring barcode types

Which types of barcodes do you need?
Which sales platforms will you use each type of barcode on?
First, save some basic information about your barcodes.

[.instruction]
Configuring barcodes:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Barcode*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New barcode*. +
→ The *New barcode* window opens.
. Enter the name.
. Select the type. Note <<table-barcode-types>>.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The barcode configuration is automatically given an ID and the settings open in a new tab.
. Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) one or more referrers.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-barcode-types]]
.Barcode types
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *GTIN 8*; +
*GTIN 13*; +
*GTIN 14*; +
*GTIN 128*
|The Global Trade Item Number (formerly European Article Number, EAN) is a product barcode for items.
The GTIN consists of 8, 13, 14 or a maximum of 128 characters and is centrally administered and issued for manufacturers upon request.

13-digit GTINs consist of the basic group, the item reference and the check digit.
The basic group has 7 to 9 digits and contains the GS1 prefix with the country code, for example 500 to 509 for the UK, as well as the company number.
The item reference of the manufacturer consists of 3 to 5 digits (depending on the basic group's length).
The check digit is the last digit.

| *ISBN*
|The International Standard Book Number is a unique number of 10 or 13 characters to register books and other independent, discontinuous publications like multimedia products and software.

| *QR*
|Quick Response Code.
The code contains data such as the version, the data format and other information.

| *CODE 128*
|Alphanumeric barcode.
The Code128 consists of start character, encoded data, check character and stop character.

| *UPC*
|The Universal Product Code is a product barcode for items.
The UPC is a 12-digit number.
By adding a leading *0*, this barcode can be used as a 13-digit GTIN.
|====

[TIP]
.Example: FNSKU barcodes
====
Even though there’s not a specific barcode type for FNSKU, you can still configure FNSKU barcodes in plentymarkets.
Enter a meaningful name and select the desired type, e.g. Code 128.
====

[#200]
== Acquiring barcodes and saving a number range

Do you already have GTINs (barcodes) for your items?
You might not if you directly import items and your manufacturer doesn’t assign GTINs.
In this case, you can acquire GTINs from an organisation like link:https://www.gs1uk.org/[GS1^].
For example, you can buy a range of 1000 barcode numbers.

But how do you get this pool of barcodes into plentymarkets?
You don’t need to import them!
Simply tell plentymarkets how many GTINs you have and which number your range begins with.
Then when you xref:item:barcodes.adoc#300[assign a barcode to an item], the next available barcode will automatically be used.

[.instruction]
Saving a GTIN number range:

. Go to *Setup » Item » GTIN*.
. Enter the starting value. +
→ For 13 digit GTINs this must be a 12 digit value.
The check digit is entered automatically.
. Enter the number of GTINs.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Why doesn't the number range look consecutive?
====
At first glance, it might not look like the numbers always increase by 1.
But don’t forget that the last digit is a check digit.
The 12 places before it are consecutive.
Leave out the check digit when you enter the starting value.
====

[#300]
== Assigning barcodes to products

A barcode is linked to xref:item:structure.adoc#[an individual variation] and not to the item as a whole.
So if you sell a t-shirt in the colours red or blue, for example, then the red and blue t-shirts will each have their own barcode.

There are a few different ways to assign barcodes to products:

[tabs]
====
Manually::
+
--
If you only have a few products, then it will probably be quickest to manually link barcodes.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. Click on the *Settings* tab in the lower row.
. In the *Barcode* area, select the xref:item:barcodes.adoc#100[previously saved barcode configuration] from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The barcode type is added and displayed in the list.
. Enter the code into the *Code* field.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.
--

Import::
+
--

If you have lots of products, then it will probably be quickest to import the barcodes.

plentymarkets has an xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool], which you can use to import several barcodes at once.
The idea is simple.
Rather than manually assigning barcodes to items, you’ll enter the same information into a CSV file and then import this file into your system.

* Instead of selecting the barcode type in the item data record, you’ll xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#1910[use the barcode type as a matching field].
* Instead of manually entering the barcode in the item data record, you’ll xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#2320[enter the barcode in a mapping field].

--

Automatically from the number range::
+
--

If you bought a xref:item:barcodes.adoc#200[range of GTIN 13 barcodes], then plentymarkets can automatically assign the next available barcode to your item.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. Click on the *Settings* tab in the lower row.
. In the *Barcode* area, select the xref:item:barcodes.adoc#100[previously saved GTIN 13 barcode configuration] from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The barcode type is added and displayed in the list.
. Click on *Generate GTIN* (terra:execute[role="darkGrey"]) to automatically insert the next available barcode.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

TIP: Use the xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#300[variation group function] or xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#600[variation batch processing] to generate GTINs for several variations at the same time.

TIP: This function is only available for the type *GTIN 13*. The button is deactivated for all other types.

[#700]
== Troubleshooting: Finding duplicate barcodes

It’s technically possible to save the same barcode for multiple variations.
If you don’t want duplicate barcodes, then you can search for and correct any duplicate codes in the system.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Barcode*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The *Duplicate barcodes* tab opens and displays a list of duplicate barcodes.
. Use the filter options *Variation ID* and *Barcode* to narrow down the search results if needed.
. Click on the variation you want to edit. +
→ The variation opens.
. Edit the variation's code.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[discrete]
=== Modifying the default settings

How precise should the test for duplicate barcodes be?
Do you want to prevent duplicate barcodes altogether?
You can customise the settings to meet the needs of your company.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Settings*.
. Choose the settings for duplicate barcodes. Note <<table-duplicate-barcodes>>.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.The test is only conducted in the UI
====
How do you create barcodes?
Via the UI, import or REST?
The test for duplicate barcodes is only conducted in the UI.
It is possible to link duplicate barcodes via import or REST, regardless of the settings.

.Settings for duplicate barcodes
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Precision of duplicate barcode check*
|How precise should the search be?
This setting controls how closely the system checks for duplicate barcodes.

[cols="1,3"]
!===

! *Barcode Definition*
!There is a check per numeric code.
In other words, the system checks whether a specific code is already saved for a specific definition.

*_Example_*:
If you've saved the barcode 1234 for the definition "GTIN 13_1", then you could still save the same code for the definition "GTIN 13_2".

! *Barcode Type*
!There is a check per barcode type.
For example: duplicate barcodes of the type GTIN.

! *Global*
!There is a check across all barcodes.

!===

| *Behaviour in case of duplicate barcodes*
|How should plentymarkets react if you try to assign a barcode to a product, but the barcode is already in use?

[cols="1,3"]
!===

! *Allow*
!It is possible to save duplicate barcodes.

! *Warn*
!It is possible to save duplicate barcodes.
However, you will see a yellow warning message, which tells you that the barcode is already saved for another variation.

! *Prevent*
!It is not possible to save duplicate barcodes.
You will see a red warning message, which tells you that the barcode was not saved because it is already being used for another variation.

== Labels

Item labels are attached to an item or to the item packaging.
They include information like the price, content, barcode, etc.
First, you’ll xref:item:barcodes.adoc#900[design] your labels with the help of templates.
Then you’ll xref:item:barcodes.adoc#1000[generate] your labels and print them out.

[#900]
=== Designing labels

You’ll design your labels with the help of templates.
Each template includes information about the size of the label, which data should be displayed on the label and where each piece of data should be positioned on the label.
You can create up to 10 label templates.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Labels*.
. Expand the *New template* area (icon:plus-square-o[role="darkGrey"]).
. Customise the settings to meet your needs:
.. xref:item:barcodes.adoc#930[Enter basic information and the label size].
.. xref:item:barcodes.adoc#960[Decide which data should appear on the label].
.. xref:item:barcodes.adoc#980[Configure the appearance of the label].
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

=== Generating and printing labels

There are a few different ways to generate and print labels.

[tabs]
====
A storage location::
+
--

Proceed as follows to manually generate and print labels for a specific storage location:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. Click on the *Warehouse* tab.
. Make sure you’ve selected a storage location in the field *Suggested storage location*.
If no storage location was selected for a variation, then the default storage location will automatically be used as a placeholder instead.
. Click on the label symbol (icon:barcode[role="blue"]) further to the right. +
→ The *Generate labels* window opens.
. Enter the number of labels to generate.
. Select a label template from the drop-down list.
. Click on terra:execute[role="darkGrey"] *Generate labels*. +
→ A PDF file with the selected number of labels is generated.

TIP: Do you only ever see the default storage location on your labels? +
 +
*_Tip 1_*: You might not have saved a suggested storage location for the variation.
Open the variation and click on the *Warehouse* tab.
Make sure you’ve selected a storage location in the field *Suggested storage location*.
If no storage location was selected for a variation, then the default storage location will automatically be used as a placeholder instead. +
 +
*_Tip 2_*: You might have clicked on the wrong label symbol.
Click on the label symbol icon:barcode[role="blue"] further to the right in the *Warehouse* tab.
If you click on the label symbol in the item toolbar further up, then the default storage location will be displayed on your label.
Remember that each variation can be stored in a different location.
In other words, an item can have multiple storage locations.
So if you generate a label for the entire item, then plentymarkets won’t know which storage location is intended. It will use the default storage location instead.

--

A variation::
+
--

Proceed as follows to manually generate and print labels for a specific variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. Click on the label symbol (icon:barcode[role="blue"]) in the lower toolbar. +
→ The *Generate labels* window opens.
. Enter the number of labels to generate.
. Select a label template from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Generate labels* (terra:execute[role="darkGrey"]). +
→ A PDF file with the selected number of labels is generated.


TIP: It’s also possible to generate labels for all variations of an item.
To do so, click on the label symbol icon:barcode[role="blue"] in the upper toolbar.


--

All items in an order::
+
--

Once you’ve finished creating a xref:item:barcodes.adoc#900[label template], a new option will appear.
Use this option to manually generate labels for all of the items that belong to a specific order.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Labels*.
. Expand an existing template (icon:plus-square-o[role="darkGrey"]).
. Enter the order ID.
. Click on *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]). +
→ A PDF file with the labels for the items of this order is generated.

--

With the app::
+
--

Do you use the plentymarkets app?
Then you can use your mobile device to xref:app:item-search.adoc#400[search for items and print labels].

--

While receiving goods::
+
--

Do you want to automatically print labels while receiving goods?
Then create a xref:automation:setting-up-processes.adoc#[plentymarkets process] and add <<automation/processes/procedures#150, the “item label” procedure>> to it.
