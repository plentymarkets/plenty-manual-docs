[#300]
== Which items are part of the special?

[#350]
=== Manual selection

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the item that should be included in the store special.
. Click on the *Global* tab.
. Find the *Online store* area. Use the *Store special* drop-down list to specify whether you want to call this item a special offer, a new item or a top item.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Other ways to select items
====
The instructions above are useful if you only want to select _a few items_.
But what if you need to edit hundreds of items?

* <<item/import-export-create/create/mass-processing#, Item group function or batch processing>>:
Find the area *Multi-Channel*.
Activate the option *Online store special* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and select the appropriate store special from the drop-down list.
* <<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-item#20, Import>>: Use the mapping field *Item / Store special*.

[#400]
=== Automatic selection

Rather than manually selecting items, you can have them automatically added to the store special, e.g. when the price drops.
This is done with the procedure manager.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Procedures*.
. Click on the *New procedure* tab.
. Select the procedure *Link items to an online store special*.
. Configure the settings for the procedure manager.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

*_Note_*: You can select the same language from both lists.

=== Special offer vs. % savings

The following applies to *Special offers*:

* If the item does not have an <<item/settings/prices#200, RRP>>, then the text will be displayed (right).
* If the item has an <<item/settings/prices#200, RRP>>, then the savings will be displayed as a percentage (left).

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I rename the texts? I don’t like “Special offer”, “New item” and “Top item”.*
--

Yes.
You can change the texts to meet your needs.
For example, you could change the text from “Top item” to “Best seller”.
<<item/online-store/store-specials#520, Further information>>.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I highlight individual variations or only entire items?*
--

Store specials can only be used to highlight <<item/introduction/structure#, entire items>>.
Store specials _can not_ be applied to individual variations.

*_Possible workaround_*:
Would you consider using tags instead?
Tags are buzz words or phrases that you can use to highlight specific variations.
However, in contrast to store specials, tags _do not_ appear on the category page.
Rather, they appear in the product details page or in an item list.

There are three steps to the process:

* <<item/settings/flags#500, Create the tags>> that you want to use for your variations, e.g. “Collector’s item”.
During the process, select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the availability *Variation* and the appropriate clients.
* <<item/managing-items#268, Link your variations to the tags>>.
For example, give rare variations the “Collector’s item” tag.
* <<online-store/shop-builder#_item_list, Create an item list>> to display the tagged variations in your plentyShop.
Don’t forget to specify the ID for your “Collector’s item” tag.
