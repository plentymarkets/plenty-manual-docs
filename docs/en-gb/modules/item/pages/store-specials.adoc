.*Can I highlight individual variations or only entire items?*
--

Store specials can only be used to highlight xref:item:structure.adoc#[entire items].
Store specials can not be applied to individual variations.

*_Possible workaround_*:
Would you consider using tags instead?
Tags are buzz words or phrases that you can use to highlight specific variations.
However, in contrast to store specials, tags do not appear on the category page.
Rather, they appear in the product details page or in an item list.
