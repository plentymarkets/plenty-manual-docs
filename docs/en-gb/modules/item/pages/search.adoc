== Searching for items and variations

[.tabs]
====
Default search::
+
--
. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Choose *filters* in the left column. Note <<table-filter-item-variations>>.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The <<item/introduction/search#600, search results>> are displayed in an overview on the right.

--
Searching for items in a category::
+
--
It’s also possible to search for items that belong to a specific <<item/managing-items#300, category>>.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Click on the *Category* tab in the left column.
. Click on a category or a subcategory. +
→ The items in this category or subcategory are displayed in the item overview.
. *_Optional_*: Switch back to the *Filter* tab in the left column.
Select additional filters to limit the search results even further.

[TIP]
.Where do I find the subcategories?
======
Click on a category’s folder icon (icon:folder[role="darkGrey"]) on the far left. This displays the subcategories within.
======

[TIP]
.Searching for items in any category again
======
Click on the *Filter* tab and remove the check mark next to *With categories*. The next search finds items in all of the categories.
======
--
Searching for items in a client::
+
--
Are you responsible for the item data in multiple plentyShops?
Proceed as described below to search for the items that belong to a specific <<item/managing-items#360, client (store)>>.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Click on the *Client* tab in the left column.
. Click on a client. +
→ This client’s items are displayed in the item overview.

[TIP]
.Combining a client with a category and filters
======
Click on a client’s folder icon (icon:folder[role="darkGrey"]) on the far left. Then click on one of the categories within the folder. The search results will be limited to items within a specific category _and_ that belong to a specific client. Use the client search along with the filter settings listed in <<table-filter-item-variations>>. This will limit your search results even further.
======

[TIP]
.Searching for the items that are _not available_ for a client
======
Place a check mark next to the words *Not available* and click on a client. The items that are not available for the client will be displayed in the item overview.
======

--
====

[TIP]
.Why aren’t my items found?
====
Do you see the <<item/introduction/search#intable-active, Active>> filter in the left column? Use this filter to specify whether you only want to search for items and variations that are currently activated for a plentyShop. This filter is set to *Yes* by default. Once you have many items and variations, this filter will help you edit your items quicker. However, it can also cause some confusion in the beginning because inactive items will not be found. Set the filter to *No* or *ALL* and search again.

=== Searching for variations within an item data record

Items always include one or more variations. When you open an item, the first variation, i.e. the <<item/introduction/structure#600, main variation>>, will automatically open as well. But how do you access an item’s additional sub-variations? Proceed as described below to search for an item’s variations.

[.instruction]
Searching for variations within items:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the item.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Select the *Filters*. Note <<table-filter-variations>>.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The filtered variations will be displayed within the item data record.

[[table-filter-variations]]
.Searching for variations within an item data record
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Filter |Explanation

| *ID*
|Enter the ID to search for the variation with this ID.

| *Variation No.*
|Enter the variation number to search for the variation with this number.

| *External variation ID*
|Enter the ID to search for the variation with this external variation ID.

| *Barcode*
|Enter the barcode to search for the variation with this barcode.

[TIP]

====
Use the filters described in <<table-filter-item-variations>> to see variations in the main overview rather than within an item data record. In the <<item/introduction/search#intable-table-type, Table type>> filter, choose the option *Variations* or *Extended*. Also use the *Variation ID* or *Variation number* filter to search for specific variations.
