=== Adding tags to variations

Once you’ve created your tags, you can link them with variations.
Tags can:

* xref:item:managing-items.adoc#268[manually be linked to variations].
* xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#2290[be linked with the help of an import file].
* xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#300[be linked with the help of the variation group function].
* xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#600[be linked with the help of the variation batch processing].

[TIP]
.Inheritance behaviour
====
Tags that you link to the main variation are passed on to the item’s sub-variations. To save other tags for a variation, deactivate inheritance and save different tags.
