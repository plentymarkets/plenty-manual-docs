== Flags

The idea is simple.
Assign each of your items one or two flags.
You’ll see these flags when you access your items in the back end.
Such visual aids help you find the right items at a glance.
You can also xref:item:search.adoc#100[search for items in the back end] that have a specific flag or combination of flags.

Take a look at the different flags that are included in plentymarkets.
By default, flags are named after their ID.
However, you can xref:item:flags.adoc#200[rename them as needed].
Once you’re happy with the names, you can xref:item:flags.adoc#300[link the flags to items].

You’ll see these flags when you access your items in the back end.
Such visual aids help you find the right items at a glance.
You can also xref:item:search.adoc#100[search for items in the back end] that have a specific flag or combination of flags.

== Tags

The idea is simple.
Assign any number of tags to each variation.
These tags serve multiple purposes:

* *_Back end overview_*: you’ll see the tags when you access your items and variations in the back end.
Such visual aids help you find the right variation at a glance.
You can also xref:item:search.adoc#intable-tags[search for variations in the back end] that have a specific tag.
* *_Keywords in the plentyShop_*: you decide which tags should be visible to customers in the plentyShop and which should not.
* *_Other types of data_*: you can even use tags to highlight other types of data, e.g. customers, orders, tickets, etc.

=== Adding tags to variations

Once you’ve created your tags, you can link them with variations.
Tags can:

* xref:item:managing-items.adoc#268[manually be linked to variations].
* xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#2290[be linked with the help of an import file].
* xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#300[be linked with the help of the variation group function].
* xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#600[be linked with the help of the variation batch processing].

[TIP]
.Inheritance behaviour
====
Tags that you link to the main variation are passed on to the item’s sub-variations. To save other tags for a variation, deactivate inheritance and save different tags.
