Categories help you group your products.
How do you want to structure your items in the plentyShop?
Which merchandise groups match your product catalogue?

[discrete]
=== Procedure

* <<item/settings/categories#100, Sketch a category structure>>
* <<item/settings/categories#200, Create the necessary categories and sub-categories>>
* <<item/settings/categories#1300, Sort your products into these categories>>
* <<item/settings/categories#1400, Publish your items and categories in the plentyShop>>

== Defining the structure

////
diese Info befindet sich auch im grünen Box im Schnelleinstieg Kapitel 1-1
////

Spend some time thinking about which categories and sub-categories match your product line.
How will your customers find their way around the plentyShop?
You might find it helpful to draw a category tree and visualise your product groups.
<<table-category-structures-examples>> shows two simplified examples of category structures.

[TIP]
.Decide on a category depth
====
How many categories can be on the first level without overwhelming your customers?
At what depth are your categories no longer visited?
<<online-store/shop-builder#_category_navigation, While setting up your plentyShop>>, you'll decide how many category levels should be displayed in the header.
====

[.collapseBox]
.*Notes for older systems only*
--

If you have an older system, then you can decide how many category levels should function in general. For example, if you choose 4 levels, then it will not be possible to create categories on the 5th level.  Save this setting for each of your clients (stores). This setting applies to the complete category tree, i.e. to all category types.

TIP: This setting only affects older systems. In new systems, this setting is obsolete and is no longer displayed. We recommend that you check whether you have this setting in your system. If so, configure the setting.

[.instruction]
Defining category levels:

. If available, go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Categories » Settings*.
. Select the maximum number of levels in the category navigation.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

--

[#200]
== Creating and editing categories

Have you already thought up a <<item/settings/categories#100, meaningful category structure>>? Then you’re ready to create the main categories and sub-categories that will group your products.

[.tabs]
====
Manual procedure::
+
--
If you only want to create or edit _a few categories_, then it's probably easiest to do so manually.

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New category* in the bottom left corner. +
→ The *Create new category* window opens.
. Enter a name for the category.
. Click on icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"] *Create*. +
→ The category is created and opened for editing.

TIP: Would you rather create a sub-category?
In the settings window, click on icon:dot-circle-o[role="blue"] *Subcategory* and select the category under which you want your new category to appear. Click on a category’s folder icon (icon:folder[role="darkGrey"]) on the far left. This displays the subcategories within.

--
Data import::
+
--
If you want to create or edit _a lot of categories_, then it's probably quickest to import the category data.

The idea is simple.
Rather than manually saving category information in plentymarkets, you’ll enter the same information into a CSV file and then import this file into your system.

* <<data/importing-data/elasticsync-best-practices/best-practices-elasticsync-categories#, Practical example: Importing new categories>>
* <<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-categories#, Directory of matching and mapping fields>>

--
====

[TIP]
.Alternative workflow: Creating categories and items at the same time
====
It’s technically possible to create items and categories at the same time.
In other words, you can create a new category while <<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#200, creating an item>>.
This method can save you a lot of time but it might also cause you to lose track of your category structure.
====

[TIP]
.Alternative workflow: plentyShop and ShopBuilder
====
New plentymarkets systems come equipped with plentyShop LTS and a ShopBuilder tool.
You can use these tools to design an attractive store without having to learn HTML and CSS first.
ShopBuilder helps you create the pages of your website and also the categories.
So if you want to use ShopBuilder to create your plentyShop, then you might also want to <<online-store/shop-builder#20, use ShopBuilder to create your categories>> too.

=== Toolbar

[[table-toolbar]]
[cols="1,4"]
|====
| Icon | Explanation

|Path
|At the very top of the screen, you’ll see the path of the currently open category.
Click on one of the parent categories to open it too.

|icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]
|Saves your changes to the category.
The symbol is greyed out if you haven’t made any changes to the category yet. +
You can recognise <<welcome/customise-system#70, unsaved changes>> because the category tab is flagged with a red triangle.

|ID
|The category ID is automatically assigned and cannot be changed. It uniquely identifies your categories. Do you manage the same category in several different languages or in several plentyShops? All of the client and language-versions of the category share the same ID.

|icon:eye[role="blue"]
|Shows you what the category looks like in your plentyShop.

|icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty, role="yellow"]
|Simultaneously shows you what the category looks like in your plentyShop and allows you to edit the category further.

|icon:code[role="blue"] +
(Not in use)
a|This function is out-dated.
It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.

////
Opens an overview of the <<online-store/online-store/cms-syntax#basics-template-variables, template variables>> and <<online-store/online-store/cms-syntax#basics-template-functions, template functions>>. If you use the old Callisto store, then you can insert template variables and template functions into your <<item/settings/categories#800, category description>>. +
Example functions:

* *&lbrace;% Link(CategoryID) %}* = Links to a different category page +
* *&lbrace;% Link_ShippingCosts() %}* = Links to shipping cost information
////

|icon:lang_multilingual[set=plenty]
|Opens <<item/settings/categories#1500, the category in two different languages>>. Which two languages do you want to see? Select them from the drop-down list at the top of the screen. You can also choose a language that doesn’t have any content yet. You do not necessarily have to open the default language.

|icon:settings_transfer[set=plenty]
a|Do you manage the same category in several different languages or in several plentyShops? This symbol transfers the category’s settings to a different client or language version.

. Choose the options (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be transferred.
. Choose the client and language versions (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be given these options.

|Template function +
(Not in use)
a|This function is out-dated.
It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.

////
If you use the old Callisto store, then you can insert <<online-store/online-store/cms-syntax#basics-template-variables, template variables>> and <<online-store/online-store/cms-syntax#basics-template-functions, template functions>> into your <<item/settings/categories#800, category descriptions>>.
If you want to insert _this category_ somewhere else, then you can find the necessary template function displayed in the toolbar. This function always includes the category ID so that it can be uniquely identified.
////

|Timestamp
|Displays the time when changes were last made and the person who made these changes.

|icon:minus-circle[role="red"]
|Deletes the category.
You will be asked if you want to delete the entire category or only the selected combination of language and client.
|====

[#700]
=== Tab: Settings

First, save some basic information about your category, e.g.:

* <<item/settings/categories#intable-use-case, what do you want to use the category for>>?
* <<item/settings/categories#intable-url, what should the URL be>>?
* <<item/settings/categories#intable-meta-data, does the category have any meta data that is relevant for SEO>>?
* <<item/settings/categories#intable-login, should people only be able to see the category if they’ve logged in>>?

[TIP]
.Why don’t I see some of the settings?
====
The settings will differ slightly depending on <<item/settings/categories#intable-use-case, what you want to use the category for>>.
Most of the settings apply to all of the category types. However, some settings are irrelevant to specific types of categories. Irrelevant settings are not displayed.
====

[[table-category-settings]]
.Category settings
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|[#intable-use-case]*Type*
a|What do you want to use the category for? In plentymarkets, categories can be used to _group products together_ or to create _content pages_ for your plentyShop.

* *Item* (icon:document[set=plenty]) = Product groups that help you structure your merchandise clearly. <<item/settings/categories#300, New categories>> are given the type *Item* by default. +
If you’ve <<item/settings/categories#1300, already linked a category to items>> and you switch the type from *Item* to *Content*, then the item links will not automatically be deleted. However, the category will no longer be displayed in the item data record.
* *Content* (icon:document[set=plenty, role="yellow"]) = Content pages for the plentyShop, e.g. information pages such as terms and conditions, payment information and shipping information.
* *Container* (icon:document[set=plenty, role="red"]) = This type of category is no longer in use. It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.
//Similar to free text field, the content of a category of the type Container can be displayed on a different page, e.g. on a different category. In addition, the order steps of the <<online-store/online-store/cms#web-design-editing-the-web-design-order-process-individual-order-process, individual order process>> are categories of this type.
* *Blog* (icon:document[set=plenty, role="yellow"]) = Do you write a <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#970, blog for your plentyShop>>? You can use blog categories to sort your entries into specific topics like “News” or “About us”.

|[#intable-category-name]*Name*
|Enter a name for the category. +
*_Note_*: You can re-use category names as long as they are used in different categories or on different levels. Within one category, however, the names may only be used once per level. +
*_SEO tip_*: Enter different meta titles and meta descriptions for categories of the same name.

|[#intable-category-tags]*Tags*
|Select <<welcome/general-functions/tags#, tags>> to assign topics to the category.

|[#intable-url]*URL name*
a|If necessary, change the name to be used for the URL. When a category is created, the category name is prefilled as the URL name automatically. You can re-use URL names as long as they are used in different categories or on different levels. Within one category, however, the URL names may only be used once per level. +
*_SEO tip_*: Because no client (store) is selected when the category is created, the automatically created URL is not indexed by search engines. However, in terms of SEO it is best not to change the URL name after the category has been activated for a client. +

*_Important_*:

* URL names cannot consist only of numbers.
* URL names cannot contain special characters. As such, only enter ASCII code.
* Do not enter the following characters at the beginning of a URL name: +
a-, b-, c-, f-, fa-, p-, t- +
These prefixes are deleted automatically. For instance, "a-class" is changed to "class" automatically. For example, for a category named "a-class", you should enter the URL name "aclass".

|[#intable-category-url]*URL*
|The URL of the category. The URL is generated automatically based on the complete path of the category, i.e. domain plus category levels plus URL name.

|[#intable-canonical]*Canonical*
|If necessary, enter the URL of a category with the same content to prevent duplicate content.

|[#intable-short-description]*Short description*
|Enter a short description of the category. Template variables are used to insert the short description into the plentyShop's design.

|[#intable-position]*Position*
|Enter a number to specify which category is displayed first, second, third, etc on this level.

*_Tip_*: Enter position numbers in increments of ten.
This will allow you to add new categories in between later without having to re-do all of the position numbers.

|[#intable-client]*Client (store)*
a|Which plentyShops should the category be visible in? Choose one, several or all of the clients in the list (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

Have you also saved _sub-categories_ underneath this category? Then the following also applies:

* Activate the option *Apply visibility to subcategory* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if you want to make the sub-categories visible for the selected clients too.
* The option *Apply visibility to subcategory* only affects the next save. In other words, the check mark disappears when you save your changes. You’ll need to re-check the option if you want to use it again in the future.
* If a sub-category is visible, then the category above it _must_ be visible too. This means:
** If you make a sub-category visible, then the categories above it will be made visible too.
** If you make a category invisible, then the sub-categories below it will be made invisible too.

|[#intable-meta-data]*Meta title*
|Enter a meta title. The meta title is displayed in the tab title of the browser and in search engine results. If you leave this field blank, the category name is used as the title. +
*_SEO tip_*: Pay attention to the length of the title. Longer titles are cut off in the tabs. Currently recommended: max. 50 characters

|[#intable-meta-description]*Meta description*
|Enter a meta description (max. 350 characters). The meta description is analysed by search engines. As such, it is especially important for the homepage. +
*_SEO tip_*: The meta description should contain the most important content in one sentence.

|[#intable-meta-keywords]*Meta keywords*
|Enter keywords that potential customers are likely to enter into search engines and that relate to the content of the category.

|[#intable-sitemap]*Sitemap*
a|Should the category be included in the sitemap?

* *Display* = Category is included in the sitemap.
* *Do not display* = Category is not included in the sitemap.

|[#intable-robots]*Robots*
a|These values tell search engine crawlers how to deal with the page and any links on the page.

* *all* = Include the website of the category in the search engine index and follow links on the page.
* *index* = Include in the search engine index.
* *nofollow* = Do not follow links on the page.
* *noindex* = Do not include in the search engine index.
* *nofollow, noindex* = Do not follow links and do not include webpage in the search index.

|[#intable-template-page]*Template page* +
(Not in use)
|This function is out-dated. It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.
//Select a template. The template that is selected here provides the framework for the category. This option is not available for categories of the type *Container*.

|[#intable-template-list]*Template list* +
(Not in use)
|This function is out-dated. It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.
//Select a template. The template determines what the category overview looks like for the current category. This option is only available for categories of the type *Item*.

|[#intable-template-product]*Template product* +
(Not in use)
|This function is out-dated. It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.
//Select a template. The template determines how individual items will be displayed within this category. This option is only available for categories of the type *Item*.

|[#intable-full-text-search]*Full text search* +
(Not in use)
a|This function is out-dated. It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.

////
Should the category be added to the store’s category search index? +
*_Note_*: The template plugin plentyShop LTS and FINDOLOGIC ignore this setting.

* *Yes* = Open the menu *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Online store » Forwarding* and check whether the option *Redirect for categories* is set to *Carry out content search*. If it is, then the category data will be searched if a customer tries to open an invalid category URL. +
The category data is also added to the store’s category search index. When customers enter a search term in the online store, the category’s name, description 1, description 2 and meta title are searched for this term. +
*_Note_*: Before you can search categories, you will need to make some changes to the code in the Calisto template *CategoryViewContentSearchResultsList*. +
* *No* = The category will not be added to the category search index.
////

|[#intable-in-link-list]*In link list*
a|Should the category be displayed in the plentyShop's navigation?

* *Display* = Category is displayed in the plentyShop's navigation.
* *Do not display* = Category is not displayed in the plentyShop's navigation.

*_Note_*: If a sub-category is displayed in the navigation, then the category above it _must_ be displayed in the navigation too.
In other words, if you select the option *Display* for a sub-category, then make sure you also selected the option *Display* for the category above it.

|[#intable-login]*Visible*
a|Should the category only be visible for users who have logged in?

* *Public* = Category is visible to all visitors of the plentyShop.
* *After login* = Category and all of its sub-categories are only visible to people who have logged in. Visitors that are not logged in will be redirected to the login page.

|[#intable-elmar-category]*Elmar category*
|Select an Elmar category.

|[#intable-variables-functions]*Translate template variables and template functions*
a|Should template variables and template functions be translated?

* *Yes* = All template variables and template functions are translated.
* *Template variables and template functions for links only* = Only template variables and template functions for links are translated.
* *No* = No template variables and template functions are translated.
|====

[#800]
=== Tab: Description 1 and 2

Compose one or two texts per category and decide where these texts should appear in the plentyShop.

*_Practical example_*:

* You want to use description 1 for a category description.
This description should appear at the top of the page.
* You want to use description 2 for SEO texts, search terms and keywords.
These SEO texts should appear at the bottom of the page.

[.instruction]
Displaying category descriptions in the plentyShop:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Open the category.
. Click on the tab *Description 1* or *Description 2*.
. Insert the text and format it as needed.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.
. Open the assistant *plentyShop LTS* and navigate to the step *Displayed information » Settings for the category view*.
. Use the drop-down lists to specify which description should appear above the item list and which description should appear below the item list.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Which editor should I use?
====
Do you see the drop-down list on the far right side of the tab *Description 1* and *Description 2*?
Use this drop-down list to specify which editor you want to edit the template with.
You can use the <<online-store/online-store/cms#_editor, Editor>>, the HTML editor *Text field* or the <<online-store/online-store/cms#_syntax_editor, Syntax editor>>.
Categories of the type *Container* can only be edited with the HTML editor *Text field* and the *Syntax editor*.
====

[#850]
=== Tab: Template

This tab is only relevant for categories of the type “Content”.
Insert HTML code here to create an <<item/online-store/callisto-templates#, item template>>.

[#900]
=== Tab: Documents

Add images and files to your categories.
You can upload the data formats JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, PDF, DOC, ODC, OTH, XLS, XML, HTML, HTM, CSS, JavaScript, ZIP, JSON and GZIP.

*_Practical example_*:

* You upload a pool of 10 different images for the category, e.g. regular images and seasonal images.
* You select one or two of these images.
These are the images that should _currently_ be displayed for the category.
So if you regularly switch out your category images, then it’s not necessary to delete the images that are not currently in use.
* You use a ShopBuilder widget to display image 1 or image 2 in your plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Displaying category images in the plentyShop:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Open the category.
. Click on the *Documents* tab.
. Add documents by clicking on the icon:upload[set=plenty, role="purple"] *Upload file* button or by dragging and dropping them into the tab.
. Move your cursor over an image and select it (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on icon:item_image_selected_1[set=plenty, role="blue"] *Image 1*. +
→ The image is outlined in red and designated with the number *1*.
. If needed, repeat the procedure to select a second category image. This time, click on icon:item_image_selected_2[set=plenty, role="blue"] *Image 2*.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.
. Go to *CMS » ShopBuilder*.
. Open the category’s <<online-store/shop-builder#55, editor view>>.
. Insert the ShopBuilder widget <<online-store/shop-builder#_background_image, Image » Background image>>.
. Open the drop-down list *Background image* and select the option *Category image 1* or *Category image 2*.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Deselecting the category image
====
You can remove a category image by selecting the image again (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and clicking on icon:item_image_selected_1[set=plenty, role="blue"] *Image 1* or icon:item_image_selected_2[set=plenty, role="blue"] *Image 2*.

You will be able to click on the greyed out buttons in the toolbar once you have selected one or more images with a check mark. By selecting images with check marks, you can see a preview, download or delete several images at the same time.
====

[#1000]
=== Tab: Note

Save helpful information about a category in the *Note* tab. For example, you can specify which sources your information comes from or let colleagues know that changes should not be made to specific paragraphs. The information saved in this tab is only visible in plentymarkets and is not displayed in the plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Saving a note:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Open the category.
. Click on the *Note* tab.
. Enter the note in the editor.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the note. +
→ The note is saved and shown in a yellow speech bubble.

[#1100]
=== Context menu

The so-called _context menu_ helps you manage your categories. Want to move, copy or delete a category? No problem! You can also open the context menu if you want to create new items or sub-categories.

[.instruction]
Opening the context menu:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Point your cursor over a category name.
. Click on the small triangle (icon:caret-down[role="darkGrey"]). +
→ The context menu is displayed.

image::item/assets/category-context-menu.png[]

* icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] *Edit category* = opens the category and lets you <<item/settings/categories#500, edit it further>>.
* icon:ticket_folder_move[set=plenty] *Move category* = moves the category, e.g. from a main category to a sub-category. Do you want to control which category is displayed first, second, third, etc? Simply change the <<item/settings/categories#intable-position, position number>>.
* icon:copy[set=plenty] *Copy category* = creates a copy of the category. Use this function, e.g. to create a similar category somewhere else. Copy the category with all of its settings and then make changes to individual options like the name, description and position.
* icon:item_plus[set=plenty] *Create new item* = opens the <<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#200, menu where you can manually create a new item>>.
* icon:minus-circle[role="darkGrey"] *Delete category* = asks you to confirm your decision to delete the category. The category will be completely deleted. In other words, if you manage the category in several different languages or plentyShops, then _all_ of the different client and language-versions will be deleted. If you only want to <<item/settings/categories#600, delete the category for specific language and client>>, then click on the delete symbol in the toolbar instead.
* icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Create subcategory* = creates a new category underneath this category.

[#1270]
== Searching for categories in the back end

You can find previously created categories in the menu *Item » Category*. They are displayed in the navigation tree on the left.

image::item/settings/assets/Categories-search.png[]

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Search* (1)
|Are you looking for a specific category?
Enter the name of the category into the search field in the upper left corner.
Search results appear while you enter the name.

| *Default* (2)
|Are you responsible for multiple plentyShops?
Select a client from this drop-down list.
Only the categories that are linked to this client will be displayed in the navigation tree on the left.

| *English* (3)
|Is your plentyShop available in multiple languages?
Select a language version from this drop-down list.

*_Category names in cursive font_*:
The font style indicates which categories are available for the selected language.
If the category name is displayed in cursive font, then the category does not exist in the selected language.

| *ALL* (4)
|Do you see category names displayed in various colours?
Don’t worry!
The colour simply indicates which <<item/settings/categories#intable-use-case, type of category>> it is.

Select a category type from this drop-down list.
Only this type of category will be displayed in the navigation tree on the left.
|====

[#1300]
== Sorting items into categories

Every item _must_ belong to a category. It’s not technically possible to create an item without a category. As such, items are sorted into categories while they are created. It doesn’t matter if you:

* <<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#200, create the item manually>>
* <<welcome/assistants#, create the item with the help of our assistant tool>>
* <<item/import-export-create/import#, import the item>>

[TIP]
.Do several categories apply?
====
Sometimes it makes sense to list an item in several different categories. You can <<item/managing-items#300, manually link categories in the item data record>> or you can enter category IDs <<item/import-export-create/import#700, comma-separated in the import files>>.

=== Creating multilingual category pages

If you want to make your plentyShop available in several different languages, you also need to create categories in these languages. This chapter explains how to create multilingual categories of the type *Content*, the type *Item* and the type *Container*. We assume that these categories already exist in your plentyShop's default language and that you’ve already met a few <<online-store/online-store/multilingual-online-store#, requirements>>.

There are two ways to create multilingual categories. You can choose between a multilingual or a monolingual editor. Use the monolingual editor to edit one language version after another. Use the multilingual editor to edit two languages at a time. Both procedures are described below.

==== Creating multilingual categories in the monolingual editor

Proceed as described below to create a language version of an existing category.

====
In order for a category to be displayed within the directory tree in the *Item » Category* menu, you must have already created this category in the system's default language. In other words, you must have at least entered a page name in the default language.

Creating language versions of a category (monolingual):

. Go to *Item » Category*.
