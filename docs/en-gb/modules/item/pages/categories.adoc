Categories help you group your products.
How do you want to structure your items in the plentyShop?
Which merchandise groups match your product catalogue?

[discrete]
=== Procedure

The configuration is divided into four steps:

== Defining the structure

//tag::category-structure-plan[]
Spend some time thinking about which categories and sub-categories match your product line.
How will your customers find their way around the plentyShop?
You might find it helpful to draw a category tree and visualise your product groups.
//end::category-structure-plan[]

The following table shows two simplified examples of category structures.

[cols="2a,2a", width=100%]
|===
|Example structure 1 |Example structure 2

* Women
  ** Shoes
  ** Accessories
  ** Clothing

* Men
  ** Shoes

[TIP]
.Decide on a category depth
====
How many categories can be on the first level without overwhelming your customers?
At what depth are your categories no longer visited?
xref:online-store:online-store.adoc#[While setting up your plentyShop], you'll decide how many category levels should be displayed in the header.
====

[#200]
== Creating and editing categories

Have you already thought up a meaningful category structure?
Then you’re ready to create the main categories and sub-categories that will group your products.

[.instruction]
Manually creating a category:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New category* in the bottom left corner. +
→ The *Create new category* window opens.
. Enter a name for the category.
. If you want to create a sub-category, then click on icon:dot-circle-o[role="blue"] *Subcategory* and select the category under which you want your new category to appear. +
*_Tip_*: Click on the category's folder icon (icon:folder[role="darkGrey"]) on the far left. This displays the subcategories within.
. Click on terra:save[role="green"] *Create*. +
→ The category is created and opened for editing.

[TIP]
.Other methods of creation
====

* *_Data import_*:
If you want to create or edit a lot of categories, then it's probably quickest to import the category data.
The idea is simple.
Rather than manually saving category information in plentysystems, you’ll enter the same information into a CSV file and then import this file into your system.

* xref:data:best-practices-elasticsync-categories.adoc#[Practical example: Importing new categories]
* xref:data:elasticSync-categories.adoc#[Directory of matching and mapping fields]

* *_plentyShop and ShopBuilder_*:
New systems come equipped with a plentyShop and a ShopBuilder tool.
You can use these tools to design an attractive store without having to learn HTML and CSS first.
It's not only possible to create the pages of your website with ShopBuilder, but also the categories.
So if you use the ShopBuilder tool to create your plentyShop, then you might also want to xref:online-store:shop-builder.adoc#create-category[use ShopBuilder to create your categories].

=== Toolbar

image::item:category-toolbar.png[]

[[table-toolbar]]
[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Icon | Explanation

|Path
|At the very top of the screen, you’ll see the path of the currently open category.
Click on one of the parent categories to open it too.

|terra:save[role="green"]
|Saves your changes to the category.
The symbol is greyed out if you haven’t made any changes to the category yet. +
You can recognise xref:welcome:customise-system.adoc#70[unsaved changes] because the category tab is flagged with a red triangle.

|ID
|The category ID is automatically assigned and cannot be changed. It uniquely identifies your categories. Do you manage the same category in several different languages or in several plentyShops? All of the client and language-versions of the category share the same ID.

|icon:eye[role="blue"]
|Shows you what the category looks like in your plentyShop.

|terra:design_inline_edit[role="yellow"]
|Simultaneously shows you what the category looks like in your plentyShop and allows you to edit the category further.

|icon:minus-circle[role="red"]
|Deletes the category.
You will be asked if you want to delete the entire category or only the selected combination of language and client.
|===

[#700]
=== Tab: Settings

First, save some basic information about your category, e.g.:

* what do you want to use the category for?
* what should the URL be?
* does the category have any meta data that is relevant for SEO?
* should people only be able to see the category if they’ve logged in?

[TIP]
.Why don’t I see some of the settings?
====
The settings will differ slightly depending on what you want to use the category for.
Most of the settings apply to all of the category types.
However, some settings are irrelevant to specific types of categories. Irrelevant settings are not displayed.
====

:manual:

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

|[#intable-use-case]*Type*
|
include::partial$type.adoc[]

|[#intable-category-name]*Name*
|
include::partial$name.adoc[]

|[#intable-category-tags]*Tags*
|Select xref:item:flags.adoc#400[tags] to assign topics to the category.

|[#intable-url]*URL name*
|
include::partial$url-name.adoc[]

|[#intable-category-url]*URL*
|The URL of the category. The URL is generated automatically based on the complete path of the category, i.e. domain plus category levels plus URL name.

|[#intable-canonical]*Canonical*
|If necessary, enter the URL of a category with the same content to prevent duplicate content.

|[#intable-short-description]*Short description*
|Enter a short description of the category. Template variables are used to insert the short description into the plentyShop's design.

|[#intable-position]*Position*
|Enter a number to specify which category is displayed first, second, third, etc on this level.

*_Tip_*: Enter position numbers in increments of ten.
This will allow you to add new categories in between later without having to re-do all of the position numbers.

|[#intable-client]*Client (store)*
|Which plentyShops should the category be visible in? Choose one, several or all of the clients in the list (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

Are there sub-categories underneath this category? Then the following also applies:

* Activate the option *Apply visibility to subcategory* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if you want to make the sub-categories visible for the selected clients too.
* The option *Apply visibility to subcategory* only affects the next save. In other words, the check mark disappears when you save your changes. You’ll need to re-check the option if you want to use it again in the future.
* If a sub-category is visible, then the category above it must be visible too. This means:
** If you make a sub-category visible, then the categories above it will be made visible too.
** If you make a category invisible, then the sub-categories below it will be made invisible too.

|[#intable-meta-data]*Meta title*
|
include::partial$meta-title.adoc[]

|[#intable-meta-description]*Meta description*
|
include::partial$categories-meta-description.adoc[]

|[#intable-meta-keywords]*Meta keywords*
|
include::partial$categories-meta-keywords.adoc[]

|[#intable-sitemap]*Sitemap*
|Should the category be included in the sitemap?

* *Display* = Category is included in the sitemap.
* *Do not display* = Category is not included in the sitemap.

|[#intable-robots]*Robots*
|These values tell search engine crawlers how to deal with the page and any links on the page.

* *all* = Include the website of the category in the search engine index and follow links on the page.
* *index* = Include in the search engine index.
* *nofollow* = Do not follow links on the page.
* *noindex* = Do not include in the search engine index.
* *nofollow, noindex* = Do not follow links and do not include webpage in the search index.

|[#intable-template-page]*Template page* +
(Not in use)
|This function is out-dated. It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.

|[#intable-template-list]*Template list* +
(Not in use)
|This function is out-dated. It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.

|[#intable-template-product]*Template product* +
(Not in use)
|This function is out-dated. It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.

|[#intable-full-text-search]*Full text search* +
(Not in use)
|This function is out-dated. It only applied to the old "Callisto" shop.

|[#intable-in-link-list]*In link list*
|Should the category be displayed in the plentyShop's navigation?

* *Display* = Category is displayed in the plentyShop's navigation.
* *Do not display* = Category is not displayed in the plentyShop's navigation.

*_Note_*: If a sub-category is displayed in the navigation, then the category above it must be displayed in the navigation too.
In other words, if you select the option *Display* for a sub-category, then make sure you also selected the option *Display* for the category above it.

|[#intable-login]*Visible*
|Should the category only be visible for users who have logged in?

* *Public* = Category is visible to all visitors of the plentyShop.
* *After login* = Category and all of its sub-categories are only visible to people who have logged in. Visitors that are not logged in will be redirected to the login page.

|[#intable-elmar-category]*Elmar category*
|Select an Elmar category.

|[#intable-variables-functions]*Translate template variables and template functions*
|Should template variables and template functions be translated?

* *Yes* = All template variables and template functions are translated.
* *Template variables and template functions for links only* = Only template variables and template functions for links are translated.
* *No* = No template variables and template functions are translated.
|===

[#800]
=== Tab: Description 1 and 2

Compose one or two texts per category and decide where these texts should appear in the plentyShop.

*_Practical example_*:

* You want to use description 1 for a category description.
This description should appear at the top of the page.
* You want to use description 2 for SEO texts, search terms and keywords.
These SEO texts should appear at the bottom of the page.

[.instruction]
Displaying category descriptions in the plentyShop:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Open the category.
. Click on the tab *Description 1* or *Description 2*.
. Insert the text and format it as needed.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Which editor do you prefer?
====
Do you see the drop-down list on the far right side of the tab *Description 1* and *Description 2*?

=== Tab: Documents

Add images and files to your categories.
You can upload the data formats JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, PDF, DOC, ODC, OTH, XLS, XML, HTML, HTM, CSS, JavaScript, ZIP, JSON and GZIP.

*_Practical example_*:

* You upload a pool of 10 different images for the category, e.g. regular images and seasonal images.
* You select one or two of these images.
These are the images that should currently be displayed for the category.
So if you regularly switch out your category images, then it’s not necessary to delete the images that are not currently in use.
* You use a ShopBuilder widget to display image 1 or image 2 in your plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Displaying category images in the plentyShop:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Open the category.
. Click on the *Documents* tab.
. Add documents by clicking on the terra:upload[role="purple"] *Upload file* button or by dragging and dropping them into the tab.
. Move your cursor over an image and select it (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on terra:item_image_selected_1[role="blue"] *Image 1*. +
→ The image is outlined in red and designated with the number *1*.
. If needed, repeat the procedure to select a second category image. This time, click on terra:item_image_selected_2[role="blue"] *Image 2*.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Go to *CMS » ShopBuilder*.

. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Deselecting the category image
====
You can remove a category image by selecting the image again (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and clicking on terra:item_image_selected_1[role="blue"] *Image 1* or terra:item_image_selected_2[role="blue"] *Image 2*.

You will be able to click on the greyed out buttons in the toolbar once you have selected one or more images with a check mark. By selecting images with check marks, you can see a preview, download or delete several images at the same time.
====

[#1000]
=== Tab: Note

Save helpful information about a category in the *Note* tab. For example, you can specify which sources your information comes from or let colleagues know that changes should not be made to specific paragraphs. The information saved in this tab is only visible in plentysystems and is not displayed in the plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Saving a note:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Open the category.
. Click on the *Note* tab.
. Enter the note in the editor.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the note. +
→ The note is saved and shown in a yellow speech bubble.

[#1100]
=== Context menu

The so-called context menu helps you manage your categories. Want to move, copy or delete a category? No problem! You can also open the context menu if you want to create new items or sub-categories.

[.instruction]
Opening the context menu:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Point your cursor over a category name.
. Click on the small triangle (icon:caret-down[role="darkGrey"]). +

|Opens the category and lets you edit it further.

| terra:ticket_folder_move[role="darkGrey"] *Move category*
|Moves the category, e.g. from a main category to a sub-category. Do you want to control which category is displayed first, second, third, etc? Simply change the xref:item:categories.adoc#intable-position[position number].

| terra:copy[role="darkGrey"] *Copy category*
|Creates a copy of the category. Use this function, e.g. to create a similar category somewhere else. Copy the category with all of its settings and then make changes to individual options like the name, description and position.

| icon:minus-circle[role="darkGrey"] *Delete category*
|Asks you to confirm your decision to delete the category. The category will be completely deleted. In other words, if you manage the category in several different languages or plentyShops, then all of the different client and language-versions will be deleted. If you only want to xref:item:categories.adoc#600[delete the category for specific language and client], then click on the delete symbol in the toolbar instead.

| icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Create subcategory*
|Creates a new category underneath this category.

[#1270]
== Searching for categories in the back end

You can find previously created categories in the menu *Item » Category*. They are displayed in the navigation tree on the left.

image::item:Categories-search.png[]

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Search* (1)
|Are you looking for a specific category?
Enter the name of the category into the search field in the upper left corner.
Search results appear while you enter the name.

| *Default* (2)
|Are you responsible for multiple plentyShops?
Select a client from this drop-down list.
Only the categories that are linked to this client will be displayed in the navigation tree on the left.

| *English* (3)
|Is your plentyShop available in multiple languages?
Select a language version from this drop-down list.

*_Category names in cursive font_*:
The font style indicates which categories are available for the selected language.
If the category name is displayed in cursive font, then the category does not exist in the selected language.

| *ALL* (4)
|Do you see category names displayed in various colours?
Don’t worry!
The colour simply indicates which xref:item:categories.adoc#intable-use-case[type of category] it is.

Select a category type from this drop-down list.
Only this type of category will be displayed in the navigation tree on the left.
|===

[#1300]
== Sorting items into categories

Every item must belong to a category. It’s not technically possible to create an item without a category. As such, items are sorted into categories while they are created. It doesn’t matter if you:

* xref:item:new-item.adoc#200[create the item manually]
* xref:welcome:assistants.adoc#[create the item with the help of our assistant tool]
* xref:item:import.adoc#[import the item]

[TIP]
.Do several categories apply?
====
Sometimes it makes sense to list an item in several different categories. You can xref:item:managing-items.adoc#300[manually link categories in the item data record] or you can enter category IDs xref:item:import.adoc#700[comma-separated in the import files].
====

[#1400]
