|Setting |Explanation

| *Field name*
|Enter a name for the free text field. The field name cannot contain special characters. If the field name of a free text field is changed, its content will not be deleted automatically. The field's content must be changed manually or with the help of a CSV file.

| *Data type*
a|Select a data type

* *Small number* = For numerical values between 0 and ± 127. +
* *Number* = For numerical values between 0 and ± 2147483647. +
* *Character string* = For alphanumerical values with a maximum length of 142 characters. +
* *Text* = For text entries with a maximum length of 65535 characters. +
* *Checkbox* = GUI element for activating and deactivating functions.

| *Characters*
|Enter the maximum number of characters. The character length is especially important for character strings. With a greater character length, the search for values in this data field will be slower. You should not simply enter the maximum available character length, but rather a realistic length. This will help you save database resources.

Once you’ve defined free text fields, you’ll need to <<item/managing-items#70, activate them>> for the appropriate items.
