In cross-selling, you subtly encourage customers to spend more money.
This is done by offering additional products that relate to the purchased product.
For example:

* The cashier at a fast food restaurant asks if you want fries with your cheeseburger.
* The sales person in an electronics store suggests a memory card that would work with the digital camera.

In e-commerce, you can't directly ask your customers if they want to buy additional products.
However, you can display a list of related items on the product pages in your plentyShop.

=== Procedure

In just two steps, you can generate additional sales through cross-selling:

* xref:item:cross-selling.adoc#200[Create cross-selling links].
* xref:item:cross-selling.adoc#700[Publish the cross-selling list in the plentyShop].

dynamisches Cross-Selling soll irgendwann mit plentyShop LTS funktionieren
ist-zustand - dynamisches cross-selling geht noch nicht mit plentyShop LTS
[TIP]
.Hast du einen Callisto Webshop?
====
If you use an older Callisto store, then you’ll also need to configure a few additional settings.
Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Online store » Settings* and use the *Cross-selling* setting to specify xref:online-store:item-sorting.adoc#_setting_up_cross_selling_templates[which type of cross-selling] you want to use.

Then use the *Dynamic cross-selling* setting to specify whether you want to use so-called xref:online-store:item-sorting.adoc#_setting_up_dynamic_cross_selling[dynamic cross-selling]. In this case, items will automatically be linked to each other if customers have purchased them at the same time.
Note that dynamic cross-selling is only possible with older Callisto stores.
It is not currently possible to set up dynamic cross-selling for newer plentyShop LTS stores.

== Creating cross-selling links

Which items should be linked together?
You can link an item to any number of other products from your portfolio.
For example, imagine you want to link a guitar to a pack of replacement strings, a song book and a guitar strap.

[tabs]
====
Manual::
+
--
. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the main item, e.g. the guitar.
. Open the tab *Cross-selling » Add item(s)*.
. Search for items again in this tab.
. Select all the accessories (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be linked to the main item, e.g. select the replacement strings, the song book and the guitar strap.
. Click on the appropriate relationship (icon:cubes[role="green"]). +
→ The links will be created and they xref:item:cross-selling.adoc#600[can be changed any time].

--
Data import::
+
--
Would you prefer to import cross-selling links, rather than create them manually?

plentymarkets has an xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool].
The idea is simple. Rather than manually saving cross-selling links in plentymarkets, you’ll xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#2310[enter the same information into a CSV file] and then import this file into your system.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Similar* (icon:item_plus[set=plenty, role="green"])
|The selected items are similar to the opened item.

| *Accessory* (icon:item_plus[set=plenty, role="green"])
|The selected items are accessories of the opened item.

| *Replacement part* (icon:item_plus[set=plenty, role="green"])
|The selected items are replacement parts for the opened item.

| *Item bundle* (icon:item_plus[set=plenty, role="green"])
|The selected items are suitable to be sold as a bundle together with the opened item.

| *Copy* (icon:copy[set=plenty, role="yellow"])
|Copies the cross-selling links and applies them to other main items.

*_Example_*:
Imagine you don’t just want to link one guitar to a pack of replacement strings, a song book and a guitar strap.
Rather, you have 50 additional guitars that should also have these cross-selling links.
It would take forever to manually link every single item.
Instead, copy the existing cross-selling links from the first main item and apply them to all 50 other main items simultaneously.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the previously linked main item, e.g. the first guitar.
. Open the tab *Cross-selling » Add item(s)*.
. Search for items again in this tab.
. Select all of the main items (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should also have these links, e.g. the 50 other guitars.
. Click on the copy symbol (icon:copy[set=plenty, role="yellow"]). +
→ The links of the opened item are transferred to all of the selected items.

| *Add to selection* (icon:check-square[role="blue"])
|Select this option if you want to link the other way around.
So for example, if you want to link a replacement part or accessory to a main item.

*_Example_*:
Imagine you want to link a pack of replacement strings to several different guitars.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the replacement part, e.g. the replacement guitar strings.
. Open the tab *Cross-selling » Add item(s)*.
. Search for items again in this tab.
. Select all of the main items (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be linked to the replacement part, e.g. select the guitars.
. Click on *Add to selection* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on the appropriate relationship (icon:cubes[role="green"]). +
→ The links will be created and they xref:item:cross-selling.adoc#600[can be changed any time].

[.instruction]

. Go to *CMS » ShopBuilder*.
. Click on the appropriate category.
. Use the toggle button (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]) to activate the content. +

Within a grey item category, you can create many different contents of the type *Item view*.
The contents can be activated or deactivated as needed.
For example, this allows you to create different pages for each season of the year.

Activating one content automatically deactivates another content of the same type.
