In cross-selling, you subtly encourage customers to spend more money.
This is done by offering additional products that relate to the purchased product.
For example:

* The cashier at a fast food restaurant asks if you want fries with your cheeseburger.
* The sales person in an electronics store suggests a memory card that would work with the digital camera.

In e-commerce, you can't directly ask your customers if they want to buy additional products.
However, you can display a list of related items on the product pages in your plentyShop.

=== Procedure

In just two steps, you can generate additional sales through cross-selling:

* xref:item:cross-selling.adoc#200[Create cross-selling links].
* xref:item:cross-selling.adoc#700[Publish the cross-selling list in the plentyShop].

dynamisches Cross-Selling soll irgendwann mit plentyShop LTS funktionieren
ist-zustand - dynamisches cross-selling geht noch nicht mit plentyShop LTS
[TIP]
.Hast du einen Callisto Webshop?
====
If you use an older Callisto store, then you’ll also need to configure a few additional settings.
Go to *Setup » plentyShop » (Select client) » Online Store Settings* and use the *Cross-selling* setting to specify xref:online-store:item-sorting.adoc#_setting_up_cross_selling_templates[which type of cross-selling] you want to use.

Then use the *Dynamic cross-selling* setting to specify whether you want to use so-called xref:online-store:item-sorting.adoc#_setting_up_dynamic_cross_selling[dynamic cross-selling]. In this case, items will automatically be linked to each other if customers have purchased them at the same time.
Note that dynamic cross-selling is only possible with older Callisto stores.
It is not currently possible to set up dynamic cross-selling for newer plentyShop LTS stores.

== Creating cross-selling links

Which items should be linked together?
You can link an item to any number of other products from your portfolio.
For example, imagine you want to link a guitar to a pack of replacement strings, a song book and a guitar strap.

[tabs]
====
Manual::
+
--
. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the main item, e.g. the guitar.
. Open the tab *Cross-selling » Add item(s)*.
. Search for items again in this tab.
. Select all the accessories (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be linked to the main item, e.g. select the replacement strings, the song book and the guitar strap.
. Click on the appropriate relationship (icon:cubes[role="green"]). +
→ The links will be created and they xref:item:cross-selling.adoc#600[can be changed any time].

--
Data import::
+
--
Would you prefer to import cross-selling links, rather than create them manually?

plentysystems has an xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool].
The idea is simple. Rather than manually saving cross-selling links in plentysystems, you’ll xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#2310[enter the same information into a CSV file] and then import this file into your system.

| *Similar* (terra:item_plus[role="green"])
|The selected items are similar to the opened item.

| *Accessory* (terra:item_plus[role="green"])

Imagine you don’t just want to link one guitar to a pack of replacement strings, a song book and a guitar strap.
Rather, you have 50 additional guitars that should also have these cross-selling links.
It would take forever to manually link every single item.
Instead, copy the existing cross-selling links from the first main item and apply them to all 50 other main items simultaneously.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the previously linked main item, e.g. the first guitar.
. Open the tab *Cross-selling » Add item(s)*.
. Search for items again in this tab.

→ The links of the opened item are transferred to all of the selected items.

| *Add to selection* (icon:check-square[role="blue"])
|Select this option if you want to link the other way around.
So for example, if you want to link a replacement part or accessory to a main item.

*_Example_*:
Imagine you want to link a pack of replacement strings to several different guitars.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the replacement part, e.g. the replacement guitar strings.
. Open the tab *Cross-selling » Add item(s)*.
. Search for items again in this tab.
. Select all of the main items (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be linked to the replacement part, e.g. select the guitars.
. Click on *Add to selection* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on the appropriate relationship (icon:cubes[role="green"]). +
→ The links will be created and they xref:item:cross-selling.adoc#600[can be changed any time].

Activating one content automatically deactivates another content of the same type.
