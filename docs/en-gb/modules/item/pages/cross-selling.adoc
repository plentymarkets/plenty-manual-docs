In cross-selling, you subtly encourage customers to spend more money.
This is done by offering additional products that relate to the purchased product.
For example:

* The cashier at a fast food restaurant asks if you want fries with your cheeseburger.
* The sales person in an electronics store suggests a memory card that would work with the digital camera.

In e-commerce, you can't directly ask your customers if they want to buy additional products.
However, you can display a list of related items on the product pages in your plentyShop.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

In just three steps, you can generate additional sales through cross-selling:

. Make sure your items meet the <<item/online-store/cross-selling#100, requirements>> for cross-selling.
. Create <<item/online-store/cross-selling#200, cross-selling links>> in plentymarkets.
. Publish the cross-selling list in your <<item/online-store/cross-selling#700, plentyShop>>.


[#100]
== Requirements

The following requirements have to be met in order for direct cross-selling items to be displayed in your plentyShop:

* <<item/online-store/checklist-categories-visibility#, The cross-selling item’s category must be activated>>.
* <<item/online-store/checklist-items-visibility#, The items must be visible in the plentyShop>>.

dynamisches Cross-Selling soll irgendwann mit plentyShop LTS funktionieren

[TIP]
.Do you have a Callisto store?
====
If you use an older Callisto store, then you’ll also need to configure a few additional settings.
Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Online store » Settings* and use the *Cross-selling* setting to specify <<online-store/online-store/item-sorting#_setting_up_cross_selling_templates, which type of cross-selling>> you want to use.

Then use the *Dynamic cross-selling* setting to specify whether you want to use so-called <<online-store/online-store/item-sorting#_setting_up_dynamic_cross_selling, dynamic cross-selling>>. In this case, items will automatically be linked to each other if customers have purchased them at the same time.
Note that dynamic cross-selling is only possible with older Callisto stores.
It is not currently possible to set up dynamic cross-selling for newer plentyShop LTS stores.

== Cross-selling links

There are a few different ways to create and edit cross-selling links.

* You can <<item/online-store/cross-selling#250, manually create and edit>> the links directly within an item data record.
* You can enter information about the cross-selling links into a CSV file and then <<item/online-store/cross-selling#650, import this file into plentymarkets>>.

[#250]
=== Manually creating and editing links

[#300]
==== Creating new links

Which items should be linked together? You can link an item to any number of other products from your portfolio. For example, imagine you want to link a guitar to a pack of replacement strings, a song book and a guitar strap.

[.instruction]
Linking a main item to accessories:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the main item, e.g. the guitar.
. Open the tab *Cross-selling » Add item(s)*.
. Search for items again in this tab.
. Select all the accessories (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be linked to the main item, e.g. select the replacement strings, the song book and the guitar strap.
. Click on the appropriate relationship (icon:cubes[role="green"]). Note <<table-cross-selling-relationship>>. +
→ The links will be created and they <<item/online-store/cross-selling#600, can be changed any time>>.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Add to selection* (icon:check-square[role="blue"])
|Select this option if you want to <<item/online-store/cross-selling#500, link the other way around>>.

| *Similar* (icon:item_plus[set=plenty, role="green"])
|The selected items are similar to the opened item.

| *Accessory* (icon:item_plus[set=plenty, role="green"])
|The selected items are accessories of the opened item.

| *Replacement part* (icon:item_plus[set=plenty, role="green"])
|The selected items are replacement parts for the opened item.

| *Item bundle* (icon:item_plus[set=plenty, role="green"])
|The selected items are suitable to be sold as a bundle together with the opened item.

| *Copy* (icon:copy[set=plenty, role="yellow"])
|<<item/online-store/cross-selling#400, Copies the cross-selling links>> and applies them to other main items.
|====

[#400]
==== Copying links

<<item/online-store/cross-selling#300, The instructions above>> taught you how to link _one main item_ to several accessories or replacement parts.
For example, how to link a guitar to a pack of replacement strings, a song book and a guitar strap.

But what if you have 50 other guitars that should _also_ have these cross-selling items? It will take forever to manually link every single item.

Instead, copy the existing cross-selling links from the first main item and apply them to all 50 other main items simultaneously.

[.instruction]
Copying cross-selling links:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the previously linked main item, e.g. the first guitar.
. Open the tab *Cross-selling » Add item(s)*.
. Search for items again in this tab.
. Select all of the main items (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should also have these links, e.g. the 50 other guitars.
. Click on the copy symbol (icon:copy[set=plenty, role="yellow"]). +
→ The links of the opened item are transferred to all of the selected items.

[#500]
==== Linking the other way around

<<item/online-store/cross-selling#300, The instructions above>> taught you how to link _one main item_ to several accessories or replacement parts.
For example, how to link a guitar to a pack of replacement strings, a song book and a guitar strap.

But it’s also possible to link _one replacement part_ to several main items. For example, to link a pack of replacement strings to several different guitars.
The procedure is nearly identical to the instructions above.

First, search for and open the replacement strings. Then click on the tab *Cross-selling » Add item(s)* and search for all of the guitars.
Finally, check the option *Add to selection* and then click on the appropriate relationship.

[#600]
==== Modifying the links at a later time

Once you’ve <<item/online-store/cross-selling#300, created a cross-selling link>>, you’ll see it in an overview within the item data record.
In other words, you’ll see which accessories or replacement parts were linked to a particular main item.
The links can be modified or deleted any time.

[.instruction]
Modifying or deleting cross-selling links:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the main item.
. Open the tab *Cross-selling » Cross-selling items*. +
→ You will see a list of all the accessories or replacement parts that were linked to this item.
. *_Modify_*: Choose a different relationship from the drop-down list.
. *_Delete_*: Select all of the items that should be deleted (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and click on *Delete link*.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[#650]
=== Importing links

Would you prefer to _import_ cross-selling links, rather than <<item/online-store/cross-selling#250, create them manually>>?

plentymarkets has an <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#, import tool>>.
The idea is simple. Rather than manually saving cross-selling links in plentymarkets, you’ll <<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-item#2310, enter the same information into a CSV file>> and then import this file into your system.

== Displaying the cross-selling list in the plentyShop

Use _ShopBuilder_ and so-called _item lists_ to display cross-selling items in your plentyShop.
This video provides a short demonstration (German only).
