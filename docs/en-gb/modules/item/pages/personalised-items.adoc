With plentymarkets, you can sell personalised items in your plentyShop.
For example, your end customers could:

* upload an image that should be printed on a t-shirt.
* choose additional options, e.g. gold or diamond trim for a wedding ring.

==== Order properties vs. Order characteristics

In plentymarkets, personalised items are sold with the help of _order properties_ or _order characteristics_.
You can use either method in your plentyShop.
However, you can not use both at the same time.

[cols="1,4a"]
|======
|Method |Explanation

| *Order properties*
|
* *_Specifications_*:

** Order properties are a special type of <<item/settings/properties#, property>>.
Customers can choose them in the plentyShop and order them along with the product.
** Order properties are newer and more flexible than order characteristics.
However, order properties are still in the beta phase of development.
** Use order properties if you want to make <<item/introduction/structure#, specific variations>> customisable.

* *_Example_*:
Your customers should be able to upload a photo that is printed on a t-shirt.
With order properties, you can specify that the photo can only be printed on a white t-shirt, but not on a colour t-shirt.

| *Order characteristics*
|
* *_Specifications_*:

** Order characteristics are a special type of <<item/settings/properties#, characteristic>>.
Customers can choose them in the plentyShop and order them along with the product.
** Order characteristics are older and less flexible than order properties.
However, thanks to their stable status, they are also less prone to errors.
** You can only make <<item/introduction/structure#, entire items>> customisable with order characteristics.

* *_Example_*:
Your customers should be able to upload a photo that is printed on a t-shirt.
With order characteristics, you can _not_ specify which t-shirt colour variation the image can be printed on.
The order characteristics apply to the entire item, i.e. to all of the variations.

.Item-specific surcharge
====
You might have already saved a surcharge <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#130, while creating the characteristic>>.
But what should you do if not every item should be given the same surcharge?
Once you’ve linked the characteristic to an item, you can enter an item-specific surcharge, which overwrites the surcharge that was saved for the characteristic as a whole.
