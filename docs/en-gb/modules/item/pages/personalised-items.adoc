With plentymarkets, you can sell personalised items in your plentyShop.
For example, your end customers could:

* upload an image that should be printed on a t-shirt.
* choose additional options, e.g. gold or diamond trim for a wedding ring.

==== Order properties vs. Order characteristics

In plentymarkets, personalised items are sold with the help of order properties or order characteristics.
You can use either method in your plentyShop.
However, you can not use both at the same time.

[cols="1,4a"]
|======
|Method |Explanation

| *Order properties*
|
* *_Specifications_*:

** Order properties are a special type of xref:item:properties.adoc#[property].
Customers can choose them in the plentyShop and order them along with the product.
** Order properties are newer and more flexible than order characteristics.
However, order properties are still in the beta phase of development.
** Use order properties if you want to make xref:item:structure.adoc#[specific variations] customisable.

* *_Example_*:
Your customers should be able to upload a photo that is printed on a t-shirt.
With order properties, you can specify that the photo can only be printed on a white t-shirt, but not on a colour t-shirt.

| *Order characteristics*
|
* *_Specifications_*:

** Order characteristics are a special type of xref:item:properties.adoc#[characteristic].
Customers can choose them in the plentyShop and order them along with the product.
** Order characteristics are older and less flexible than order properties.
However, thanks to their stable status, they are also less prone to errors.
** You can only make xref:item:structure.adoc#[entire items] customisable with order characteristics.

* *_Example_*:
Your customers should be able to upload a photo that is printed on a t-shirt.
With order characteristics, you can not specify which t-shirt colour variation the image can be printed on.
The order characteristics apply to the entire item, i.e. to all of the variations.
