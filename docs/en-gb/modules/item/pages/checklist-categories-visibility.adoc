You’ve finished <<item/settings/categories#, creating a category>> and now you want to see what it looks like in your plentyShop. But where is it? Why isn't it visible?
Work through this checklist and make sure your category meets all of the requirements for being visible in the plentyShop.

This checklist helps you find any possible errors that are preventing your categories from being displayed. Our example screenshots show the settings as they appear in a default system. Your own settings may differ.

[#100]
== Is the right client linked to the category?

//tag::mandant[]
With plentymarkets, you can manage several online stores, i.e. <<online-store/setting-up-clients#, several clients>>, with only one software. Consequently, it is possible to manage several different areas of business with one plentymarkets system.
That’s a great advantage. But it also means that you’ll always need to tell plentymarkets which online store a category should appear in.

[.instruction]
Linking a client to the category:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Click on the category in the directory tree on the left. +
→ The category opens and the *Settings* tab is visible.
. Scroll down to the *Client (store)* option and choose whichever store (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the category should appear in.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[#200]
== Have you chosen the correct settings for the link list?

//tag::linkliste[]
You can decide which categories should appear in your plentyShop's navigation. If a category is hidden, then logically, you won’t be able to see it in the plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Making a category visible in the link list:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Click on the category in the directory tree on the left. +
→ The category opens and the *Settings* tab is visible.
. Scroll down to the *In link list* option and choose *Display* from the drop-down list.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Sub-categories
====
If a sub-category is displayed in the navigation, then the category above it _must_ be displayed in the navigation too.
In other words, if you select the option *Display* for a sub-category, then make sure you also selected the option *Display* for the category above it.
====
//end::linkliste[]

[#300]
== Is a variation linked to the category?

//tag::variante[]
A category will only be visible if it’s linked to at least one <<item/online-store/checklist-items-visibility#, variation that’s visible in the plentyShop>>.

[.instruction]
Linking a variation to a category:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#400, Search for and open the variation>>.
. Click on the *Categories* tab.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *Link category*. +
→ The *Link category* window opens.
. Select a category or subcategory.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *Link category*. +
→ The category is linked and displayed in the *Linked categories* area.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[#500]
== Have you saved the category texts for every client?

//tag::texte-mandant[]
Do you work with multiple clients?
If so, then make sure that you've correctly configured the category texts _for every client_, not just for the default client.

Category texts are things like the name, URL, description and keywords.
Such information needs to be saved for every client separately.

[.instruction]
Saving category texts for additional clients:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Select the client from the left drop-down list.
. Click on the category in the directory tree on the left. +
→ The category opens and the *Settings* tab is visible.
. Enter the category texts for the client (name, URL, etc.).
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

//end::texte-mandant[]

[#600]
== Could it be a cache problem?

//tag::cache[]
Even if the category is configured correctly, it can still take an hour before the category becomes visible in the plentyShop. This is due to the cache.
//end::cache[]

[#400]
== Notes for older systems only

[.collapseBox]
.*Is the category activated in the system settings?*
--

//tag::systemeinstellungen[]
By default, categories are already activated once they’ve been created. But if a category was deactivated for one reason or another, then it won’t be visible in the plentyShop.

TIP: This setting only affects older systems. In new systems, this setting is obsolete and is no longer displayed. We recommend that you check whether you have this setting in your system. If so, activate the setting.

[.instruction]
Activating a category:

. If available, go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Categories » Activate*.
. Choose all of the categories (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be activated.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[.collapseBox]
.*Have you correctly defined the number of category levels?*
--

//tag::ebenentiefe[]
First decide how many category levels should function in general. For example, if you choose 4 levels, then it will not be possible to create categories on the 5th level.  Save this setting for each of your clients (stores). This setting applies to the complete category tree, i.e. to all category types.

TIP: This setting only affects older systems. In new systems, this setting is obsolete and is no longer displayed. We recommend that you check whether you have this setting in your system. If so, configure the setting.

[.instruction]
Defining category levels:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Categories » Settings*.
. Select the maximum number of levels in the category navigation.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.
