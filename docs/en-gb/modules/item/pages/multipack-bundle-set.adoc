plentysystems offers a variety of ways to combine products and sell them as a single unit.
This page explains the basic concept and teaches you how to manually create multipacks, item bundles and sets.

[TIP]
.Manual creation vs. Import
====
This page teaches you how to manually create the data records.
But plentysystems also includes an import tool, which you can use to import multipacks, item bundles and sets.
Further information can be found in the xref:item:multipack-bundle-set.adoc#400[FAQ area].

[#100]
== Multipacks

*_Example_*: 1 bottle of water, a package containing 6 bottles and a package containing 12 bottles.

*_Technical specifications_*:

* Multipacks are different quantities of the same variation.
* The main variation is the smallest sales unit of the product, e.g. 1 bottle.
* All of the other variations are combinations of this smallest sales unit, e.g. 6 or 12 bottles.
* Stock is managed for the main variation only.
* All variations of a multipack have the same attributes.

[#110]
=== Creating a new multipack

Create the multipack data record by entering some basic information about the product.
After creating the multipack, you will add further product information and then activate the multipack when it is ready to be sold.

//#gif#

[.instruction]
Creating a new multipack:

. Go to *Item » Items*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] and select *Multipack item*.
. A pop-up window opens. This window is divided into several steps. Carry out the settings in each step.

[.collapseBox]
.*Step: Name*
--

//ToDo - füge die Tabelle stattdessen mit ein Include-Tag ein

:manual:

[cols="1,4a"]
|===

| *Item name* +
[red]#(Mandatory field)#
|Enter a name for the item.

*_Note_*:
Once you’ve created the item, you can translate the name into other languages or save additional names, e.g. if you want the item to have a different name on marketplaces.

|===

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Step: Categories*
--

//ToDo - füge die Tabelle stattdessen mit ein Include-Tag ein

[cols="1,4"]
|===

| *Choose categories* +
[red]#(Mandatory field)#
a|Which category should the item be sorted into?

. Click on *Choose categories*. +
→ A pop-up window opens.
. Expand the entries (icon:chevron-right[role="darkGrey"]) and select all of the categories (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that the item should appear in.
This list only includes the xref:item:categories.adoc#[categories] that you’ve already created in plentysystems.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The selected categories will be displayed as a table.
Click on material:delete[role="darkGrey"] to remove a category from this list or click on icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] *Choose categories* to add further categories.

|===

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Step: Main variation*
--

An item’s first variation is called its main variation.

* For multipacks, the main variation is the smallest sales unit of the product, e.g. 1 bottle.
* All of the other variations are combinations of this smallest sales unit, e.g. 6 or 12 bottles.
* Stock is managed for the main variation only.

[cols="1s,4"]
|===

| Variation number
|Enter a number for the main variation.

| Content +
Unit
|Enter a numerical value for the main variation and choose a unit from the drop-down list, e.g. 500ml or 150g.

| Choose attributes
a|The main variation can have attributes, but it is not required to.

. Click on *Choose attributes*. +
→ A pop-up window opens.
. Expand the attributes (icon:chevron-right[role="darkGrey"]) and select the attribute values (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that you want to use for the main variation, e.g. “carbonated”.
This list only includes the xref:item:attributes.adoc#[attributes and values] that you’ve already created in plentysystems.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The selected attribute values will be displayed as a table.
Click on material:delete[role="darkGrey"] to remove an attribute value from this list or click on icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] *Choose attributes* to add further attribute values.

*_Note_*: All variations of a multipack have the same attributes.
So, for example, you cannot create a multipack where some water bottles are carbonated and others are non-carbonated.

=== Creating the necessary quantities

Multipacks are different quantities of the same variation.
For example, customers can buy 1 bottle of water, a package containing 6 bottles or a package containing 12 bottles.

//#gif#

[.instruction]
Creating the necessary quantities:

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open multipack] » Variation overview*.
. Click on *Create variations* (icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]).
. A pop-up window opens. This window is divided into several steps. Carry out the settings in each step.

=== Adding further product data

While creating the data record, you entered some basic information.
Now add further product data.
For example, what should the multipack look like?
Which images and texts should be displayed?

[.collapseBox]
.*Sales price*
--

How much should the multipack cost when it is sold as a 1, 6 or 12-pack?
Decide which price should apply for each quantity.
You will have to deactivate the inheritance of sales prices and then save the price separately for each quantity.

---

[.instruction]
Saving a price for the main variation:

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open multipack] » [Open main variation] » Element: Sales prices*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]. +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. Select the sales prices (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be linked to the variation.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The data will be displayed as a table.
. Enter the monetary price.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

---

[.instruction]
Saving a price for a sub-variation:

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open multipack] » [Open sub-variation]*.
. Click on *Inheritance* (terra:item_variation_inheritance[role="darkGrey"]) in the upper toolbar.
. Deactivate the inheritance of sales prices.
. Click on *Execute*.
. Navigate to the element *Sales prices*.
. Enter a different monetary price for the sub-variation.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.
. Repeat the process for the other quantities.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Stock*
--

Stock is managed for the main variation only.
That means, the other variations’ stock is purely informative.
When the stock level of the main variation changes, the stock for all other variations of the item is recalculated.

[#140]
=== Viewing the multipack in the front end

//mit ein Include-Tag einbinden

Are you curious what the new product will look like in your plentyShop or on Amazon?
See a preview of the item and find out where you need to add further product data or adjust the settings.

//#gif#

[.instruction]
Viewing a preview of the item:

. Click on *Product link* (material:open_in_new[role="darkGrey"]) in the toolbar. +
→ A pop-up window opens.
. Carry out the settings.
. Click on material:open_in_new[role="darkGrey"] *Open*. +
→ A preview of the item is shown.

[TIP]

[#150]
=== Putting the multipack up for sale

//mit ein Include-Tag einbinden

Variations are not visible to customers in the plentyShop until they have been activated.
In other words, you can work on inactive variations without your customers noticing.
You activate the variation when you’re ready for it to be visible in your plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Activating a variation:

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open variation] » Element: Availability and visibility*.
. Select the option *Active* (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]).
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Complete checklist for item visibility
====
Not only do items need to be activated, but they also need to have a price, a category and positive net stock.
Otherwise customers wouldn’t be able to buy the item.
Work through xref:item:checklist-items-visibility.adoc#[this checklist] and make sure your item meets all of the requirements for being visible in the plentyShop.
This checklist helps you find any possible errors that are preventing your items from being displayed.

[#200]
== Item bundles

*_Example_*: A beard care kit consisting of scissors, a brush, beard oil and beard wax.

*_Technical specifications_*:

* The components (e.g. scissors, brush, oil, wax) can:
** be sold separately as individual items.
** be sold together as a bundle.
End customers buy the entire bundle.
They can not decide which components are included in the bundle.
For example, they can not buy the beard care kit without the beard wax.
* It’s possible to make the bundle price cheaper than the sum of all the individual prices.
* It’s possible to combine variations with different tax rates together in one bundle.
* All of the components must be stored in the same warehouse.
* The bundle’s stock level is determined by the component with the lowest stock.
You do not manage stock for the bundle itself.

[#210]
=== Creating a new item bundle

Let’s stick with the example that you want to create a beard care kit consisting of scissors, a brush, beard oil and beard wax.
This is done in three steps:

. You create the individual components, e.g. the scissors, brush, beard oil and beard wax.
. You create the bundle itself, e.g. the beard care kit.
. You add the components to the bundle.

[.collapseBox]
.*Creating the individual components*
--

The components can be purchased as individual items and/or as a bundle.
Example: the scissors can be purchased individually.
They can also be part of a bundle.

[.instruction]
Creating a component:

. Go to *Item » Items*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] and select *Standard item*.
. A pop-up window opens. This window is divided into several steps. Carry out the settings in each step.
xref:item:manually-create-item.adoc#200[Further information about the settings].

[TIP]
.Add further product data to the components
====
What should the component look like when it is sold individually?
Which image and text should be displayed?
How much should the individual item cost?
Add further information for when the component is sold as an individual item.
For example, you can:

* xref:item:directory.adoc#40[Upload images]
* xref:item:directory.adoc#50[Write product texts]
* xref:item:directory.adoc#340[Save prices]
* xref:item:directory.adoc#30[View stock information]
====

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Creating the bundle itself*
--

Now create an item that represents the bundle itself.
You do not manage stock for the bundle itself.
The bundle’s stock level is determined by the component with the lowest stock.

[.instruction]
Creating a new item:

. Go to *Item » Items*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] and select *Standard item*.
. A pop-up window opens. This window is divided into several steps. Carry out the settings in each step.
xref:item:manually-create-item.adoc#200[Further information about the settings].
. Finally, you add the components to the bundle.

[TIP]
.Using an existing item as a bundle
====
Instead of creating a new bundle item, you can also use an existing item and add components to this item.
Note that the bundle item to which components are added must not have stock.
====

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Adding the components to the bundle*
--

Select all of the components that should be sold together as a bundle.
It’s possible to combine variations with different tax rates together in one bundle.
But all of the components must be stored in the same warehouse.

//ToDo - als Include von der Verzeichnis-Seite einbinden (oder andersrum, also hier ausgeschrieben und als Include in die Verzeichnis-Seite, siehe auch da die ToDo) - Attribute verwenden, um Variante öffnen in Paket öffnen > Varianten-Ebene zu ändern

[.instruction]
Adding components to the bundle:

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open bundle] » [Variation level] » Element: Bundle*.
. Within the element, click on icon:ellipsis-v[role="darkGrey"] and then on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Add bundle component*. +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. Choose which variations (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) should be added to the bundle.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The data will be displayed as a table.
. Enter the quantity.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

--

[#220]
=== Adding product data for the bundle

What should the bundle look like when it is sold as a whole?
Which image and text should be displayed?
How much should the entire bundle cost?
Now add further information for when the bundle is sold as a whole.

[.collapseBox]
.*Sales price*
--

The bundle price is saved separately from the prices of the individual components.
For example, you can make the bundle price cheaper than the sum of all the individual prices.

//ToDo - als Include von der Verzeichnis-Seite einbinden - Attribute verwenden, um Variante öffnen in Paket öffnen > Varianten-Ebene zu ändern

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open bundle] » [Variation level] » Element: Sales prices*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]. +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. Select the sales prices (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should be linked to the variation.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The data will be displayed as a table.
. Enter the monetary price.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

While processing the order, only the bundle price will be displayed.
The components will be displayed without their individual prices.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Stock*
--

The bundle’s stock level is determined by the component with the lowest stock.
You do not manage stock for the bundle itself.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Weight and purchase price*
--

//ToDo - als Include von der Verzeichnis-Seite einbinden (oder andersrum, also hier ausgeschrieben und als Include in die Verzeichnis-Seite, siehe auch da die ToDo) - Attribute verwenden, um Variante öffnen in Paket öffnen > Varianten-Ebene zu ändern

An item bundle is made up of various components.
Each component has its own key figures, such as a weight and a purchase price.
But how do these key figures come together for the entire bundle?
You could enter a weight and purchase price for the entire bundle as a whole.
But there’s also a way to have plentysystems automatically calculate these figures for you.

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open bundle] » [Variation level] » Element: Bundle*.
. Within the element, click on icon:ellipsis-v[role="darkGrey"] and then on icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] *Configure bundle automatics*. +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. Select the automatic functions as needed (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]).
. Click on *Apply*.

[cols="1,3"]
|===

| *Bundle gross weight: Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|The gross weight is automatically calculated based on the individual components.
That means, the field xref:item:directory.adoc#180[Gross weight in grams] will be greyed out within the element *Content / Dimensions*.

| *Bundle net weight: Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|The net weight is automatically calculated based on the individual components.
That means, the field xref:item:directory.adoc#180[Net weight in grams] will be greyed out within the element *Content / Dimensions*.

| *Bundle net purchase price: Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|The net purchase price is automatically calculated based on the individual components.
That means, the field xref:item:directory.adoc#190[Net purchase price] will be greyed out within the element *Costs*.

| *Bundle moving average purchase price (net): Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|The moving net purchase price is automatically calculated based on the individual components.
That means, the field xref:item:directory.adoc#190[Net moving average purchase price] will be greyed out within the element *Costs*.

|===

[TIP]
.Using automatic calculation by default
====
Do you only have a few items that should be excluded from the automatic calculation?
No problem!
You can activate the automatic calculation by default.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Settings*.
. Decide which key figures should be calculated by default.
Use the following options:
* *Bundle automatic for gross weight*
* *Bundle automatic for net weight*
* *Bundle automatic for purchase prices*
* *Bundle automatic for moving average purchase prices*

[#300]
== Sets

*_Example_*: A football uniform composed of a jersey, shorts and socks. End customers can put their own uniforms together by selecting the appropriate size and colour for each of the three components.

*_Technical specifications_*:

* Sets consist of multiple items (jersey, shorts, socks).
* While placing an order, the end customer chooses the appropriate variation (size, colour) for each item.
* The main variation is virtual. This means that the main variation cannot be sold.
* The set function is only intended for the plentyShop.
** It’s not possible to sell item sets on marketplaces like Amazon and eBay.
** It’s not possible to sell item sets with POS or pick them with the app.

[#305]
=== Preparation: Components

[discrete]
==== Theory

A set consists of multiple items (jersey, shorts, socks).
While placing an order, the end customer chooses the appropriate variation (colour, size) for each item.
It can be helpful to sketch out the items and variations that will be included in the set.

[discrete]
==== Practice

If the necessary items and variations do not already exist in your system, then you will need to create them first.

. Go to *Item » Items*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] and select *Standard item* since the components are normal items and variations.
. A pop-up window opens. This window is divided into several steps. Carry out the settings in each step.

xref:item:manually-create-item.adoc#200[Further information about creating items].

[#310]
=== Preparation: Prices

[discrete]
==== Theory

The unique thing about sets is that you don't know in advance exactly how end customers will combine the variations. Therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to save fixed prices for sets.
Instead, plentysystems calculates the price of the cheapest possible combination and saves this information for the set.
This minimum price can be displayed in the plentyShop and in the back end. For example: "Available from € 99.99".

plentysystems regularly checks the prices of all the variations in the set and calculates the cheapest possible combination.
plentysystems checks the prices:

* when you add a component to a set
* when you remove a component from a set
* when you manually update the "from-price"

==== Practice

. xref:item:prices.adoc#200[Create a sales price for sets].
Choose the type *Set price*.

*_Note_*: Set components are normal variations.

[TIP]
.Can items be cheaper if they’re purchased together as a set?
====
It’s possible to make a set cheaper than the sum of its components.
There are two ways to do this:

* On the one hand, you could save lower monetary prices for the set sales price than for the normal sales price.
* On the other hand, you could xref:item:multipack-bundle-set.adoc#345[enter a percentage of discount] that applies to the entire set.

=== Creating a new set

Have you already decided which items and variations should be included in the set?
Have you created a sales price especially for sets?
Then you’re ready to start creating sets.

[.instruction]
Creating a new set:

. Go to *Item » Items*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] and select *Item set*.
. A pop-up window opens.
This window is divided into several steps.
Carry out the settings in each step.

[.collapseBox]
.*Step: Name*

|Enter a name for the set.

*_Note_*:
Once you’ve created the set, you can translate the name into other languages or add further names.

[red]#(Mandatory field)#
a|Which category should the set be sorted into?

. Click on *Choose categories*. +
→ A pop-up window opens.
. Expand the entries (icon:chevron-right[role="darkGrey"]) and select all of the categories (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that the set should appear in.
This list only includes the xref:item:categories.adoc#[categories] that you’ve already created in plentysystems.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The selected categories will be displayed as a table.
Click on material:delete[role="darkGrey"] to remove a category from this list or click on icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] *Choose categories* to add further categories.

|===

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Step: Item set*
--

Which items should be included in the set?

. Click on *Add item set components*. +
→ A pop-up window opens.
. Search (icon:search[role="darkGrey"]) for the items that you want to add to the set. +
→ The items are listed.
. Select the items (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) you want to add to the set.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The selected items will be displayed as a table.
Click on material:delete[role="darkGrey"] to remove an item from this list again.
. If needed, enter the maximum and minimum order quantities for each component.

[TIP]
.Minimum quantity / Maximum quantity
====
Imagine you sell football uniforms, consisting of a jersey, shorts and socks.
You only want to sell the uniforms to teams that will buy at least 10 jerseys, shorts and socks at one time.
In this case, you’ll enter 10 as the minimum order quantity for each component.

[TIP]
.Minimum quantity can not be 0
====
It's not possible to sell sets with optional components.
That means:

* End customers always buy the entire set.
They can not decide which components should be included in the set.
For example, they can not buy the football uniform without the socks.
* While it's technically possible to enter 0 into the field *Minimum quantity*, this does not affect the minimum order quantity in the plentyShop.
The minimum order quantity will still be displayed as 1 in the plentyShop.
====

[TIP]
.Items with / without variations
====
* If you add an item with variations to the set, then your customers will be able to choose which variation they want to buy.
* If you add an item without variations to the set, i.e. an item that only consists of a main variation, then your customers won’t be able to select anything.

[TIP]
.What’s the main variation for?
====
A main variation is automatically created when you create a new set.
This main variation is linked to the set. It can only be created or deleted together with the set.
The main variation:

* is purely virtual and does not correspond to a physical product.
* helps you manage settings for the entire set.

==== Managing the stock

The stock of a set depends on the variation with the lowest stock.
This means:

* You do not manage stock for the set itself.
* You manage stock for the set components.

[#340]
==== Optional: Manually updating the “from-price”

plentysystems regularly checks the prices of all the variations in the set and calculates the cheapest possible combination.
plentysystems checks the prices whenever a component is added to a set or removed from a set, as well as every night.
But you can also manually update the “from-price” at any time.

[.collapseBox]
.*Updating the "from price" for one variation*
--

.*Updating the "from price" for multiple variations*
--

. Go to *Item » Items*.
. xref:item:item-search.adoc#100[Set search filters as needed and start the search].
. Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the items to be edited.

→ The action is added to the lower part of the window.
. Select the option *Update price from in sets* in the lower part of the window (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Execute the group function.
--

[#345]
==== Optional: Granting discounts

By default, the price of an item set is equivalent to the sum of the individual prices of all set components. However, you can offer a discount in % on the total price of the set.

[.instruction]
Saving a discount for an item set:

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open set] » [Open item level] » Element: Set discounts*.
. Enter a percentage.
The total price will be discounted by this percent.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings. +
→ The discount is applied.

==== Adding further product data

This page only describes the functions that apply specifically to sets.
But there are lots of other settings and options that you can also configure in the data record.
For example:

* xref:item:directory.adoc#40[Images]
* xref:item:directory.adoc#50[Descriptive texts]
* xref:item:directory.adoc#60[Basic item data]
* xref:item:directory.adoc#120[Cross-selling links]

These settings correspond to the same ones available for regular items, e.g. items of the type *Standard*.
You can find explanations of these settings in the xref:item:directory.adoc#[directory of item data fields].

[#360]
=== Displaying sets in the plentyShop

[#365]
==== Creating content of the type “Item set”

. Go to *CMS » ShopBuilder*.
. Click on a grey item category on the left. +
*_Note_*: Item sets are not compatible with the yellow content categories.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *Add content*.
. Choose the type *Item set*.
. Enter a name and choose a preset if desired.
. Click *Create*. +
→ The new content is displayed in the overview.

image::item:set-create-content.gif[]

[TIP]
.Preset: pro and con
====
We provide a template, which you can modify and adapt to your product portfolio as needed.
Of course, you can also work without a template if you would prefer to design the view from scratch.
====

[#370]
==== Designing the content

Set components are displayed with the widget *Item / Components for item sets*.
This widget is special because you can place other item widgets inside it, e.g. for descriptions and images.

Depending on the placement - inside or outside the widget - item information such as name, image and description relate to the entire set or to a set component.
For example, you can display one image for the entire set and other images for each component.

How do you design the layout, add widgets and modify the widget settings?
You can find this information on the xref:online-store:shop-builder.adoc#editor-view[ShopBuilder page of the manual].

image::item:set-design-content.gif[]

[#375]
==== Activating the content

In order for the content to be displayed in the plentyShop, it needs to be activated.
Active contents are highlighted in blue.

[.instruction]
Activating contents:

. Go to *CMS » ShopBuilder*.
. Click on the appropriate category.
. Use the toggle button (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]) to activate the content. +
→ A pop-up window opens.
. Decide which item sets the content should apply to (icon:dot-circle-o[role="blue"]).
For example, you can design the layout differently for each category.
. Click on *Activate*. +
→ The content is activated and is now highlighted in blue.

[TIP]
.Only activate one content of the same type
====
Within a grey item category, you can create many different contents of the type *Item set*.
The contents can be activated or deactivated as needed.
For example, this allows you to create different pages for each season of the year.
However, only one content of the type “Item set” can be activated simultaneously.
Activating one content automatically deactivates another content of the same type.
====

[#380]
==== Viewing the set in the front end

//mit ein Include-Tag einbinden

Are you curious what the new set will look like in your plentyShop?
See a preview of the set and find out where you need to add further product data or adjust the settings.

//#gif#

[.instruction]
Viewing a preview of the set:

. Click on *Product link* (material:open_in_new[role="darkGrey"]) in the toolbar. +
→ A pop-up window opens.
. Carry out the settings.
. Click on material:open_in_new[role="darkGrey"] *Open*. +
→ A preview of the set is shown.

[TIP]
.Product links for items or variations

Variations are not visible to customers in the plentyShop until they have been activated.
In other words, you can work on inactive variations without your customers noticing.
You activate the variation when you’re ready for it to be visible in your plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Activating a variation:

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open variation] » Element: Availability and visibility*.
. Select the option *Active* (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]).
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

[TIP]

====
Not only do items need to be activated, but they also need to have a price, a category and positive net stock.
Otherwise customers wouldn’t be able to buy the item.
Work through xref:item:checklist-items-visibility.adoc#[this checklist] and make sure your item meets all of the requirements for being visible in the plentyShop.
This checklist helps you find any possible errors that are preventing your items from being displayed.

[.collapseBox]
.*Standard item vs. Multipack item vs. Set item*
--

* *Standard item*: This type is suitable for:
** Normal items and variations.
Example: a t-shirt that’s available in the colours red, blue and green.
xref:item:manually-create-item.adoc#200[Further information about creating this type of item].
** Bundles.
Example: a beard care kit consisting of scissors, a brush, beard oil and beard wax.
xref:item:multipack-bundle-set.adoc#200[Further information about creating this type of item].
* *Multipack item*: This type is suitable for multipacks.
Example: 1 bottle of water, a package containing 6 bottles and a package containing 12 bottles.
xref:item:multipack-bundle-set.adoc#100[Further information about creating this type of item].
* *Set item*: This type is suitable for sets.
Example: a football uniform composed of a jersey, shorts and socks. End customers can put their own uniforms together by selecting the appropriate size and colour for each of the three components.
xref:item:multipack-bundle-set.adoc#300[Further information about creating this type of item].

*_Note_*: This setting can not be changed once you’ve created the item.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Manual creation vs. Import*
--

This page teaches you how to manually create the data records.
But plentysystems also includes an xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool], which you can use to import multipacks, item bundles and sets.
The idea is simple.
Rather than manually saving item data in plentysystems, you’ll enter the same information into a CSV file and then import this file into your system.

* Use the import type *Item*.
* Use the mapping field xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#250[Item / Type] to specify what type of item you want to import.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I created a set, but I can’t select a price. What should I do?*
--
A set doesn’t have a fixed price that you define yourself.
Rather, plentysystems checks the price of each component and then calculates the cheapest possible price for the entire set.
For example: "Available from € 99.99".

[.instruction]
Configuring set prices:

. xref:item:prices.adoc#200[Create a sales price for sets].
Choose the type *Set price*.
. xref:item:prices.adoc#900[link this sales price] to all of the set components and enter a monetary price for each component. +
*_Note_*: Set components are normal variations.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I created a set and I want to control the order in which the components are displayed in the plentyShop. How do I do that?*
--
There is not currently a setting to control which component is displayed first, second, third, etc.
However, we’re planning to implement a position field in the future.

*_Workaround_*:
Add the components in whichever order they should be displayed in the plentyShop.
--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I create a set with optional components?*
--

No. It's not possible to sell sets with optional components.
That means:

* End customers always buy the entire set.
They can not decide which components should be included in the set.
For example, they can not buy the football uniform without the socks.
* While it's technically possible to enter 0 into the field *Minimum quantity*, this does not affect the minimum order quantity in the plentyShop.
The minimum order quantity will still be displayed as 1 in the plentyShop.

==== Mehrere Pakete in einem Artikel abbilden

Item variations also can be bundles with multiple components. In this way, you can design very complex item bundles that meet your individual needs.

*_Example of bundle variations_*: Let's assume that you want to sell a bundle consisting of a hand towel and a larger bath towel. You also want to offer this bundle in different colours. To do so, the following steps are necessary:

* Create an attribute with the colours you want to offer, for example red and blue.
* Create an item that will serve as the bundle item, for example towel bundle.
* Create variations of the bundle item and link the attribute values.
* Create items for the bundle components, for example hand towel and bath towel.
* Create variations of the bundle components, for example red hand towel, blue hand towel etc.
* Add the bundle components to the variations of the item bundle.

In doing so, you can sell the item *towel bundle* in your plentyShop and offer the bundle colours *red* and *blue*.
