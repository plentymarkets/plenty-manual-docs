|Setting |Explanation

| *ID*
|The IDs 1-10 are automatically assigned by plentymarkets and cannot be changed.

*_Use case_*: Imagine you want to xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#550[import lots of item data with the help of a CSV file]. Among other things, you want to specify the availability of each item. You can use the IDs 1-10 to specify the availability of each item.

| *Backend icon*
|The system’s availability icons are displayed here. These icons are set by default and can be replaced with individual icons.

| *Name*
|Enter a name or a description for the delivery time, for example “delivery within 2-4 days”.

*_Note_*: Not all wording is permitted.
It’s a good idea to look up the current legal requirements regarding delivery times in e-commerce.
Consult your legal advisor if you have any questions about the current legal requirements.

*_Tip_*: Choose a different language from the drop-down list if you want to save the availability texts in multiple languages.

| **Average delivery period**
|Enter the average delivery time in days. These values will be analysed by search engines.

*_Tip_*: Enter realistic delivery times, as this information is considered to be a promise and it is also relevant in terms of competition law.

| *Online store icon*
|Here you’ll see three buttons.
Click on the button on the far left to open a detailed view of the symbol.

== Setting the availability of a variation

In plentymarkets, the availability information can either be static or dynamic.

* *Static*: You select a processing time that is always true for the variation, e.g. ready to be shipped within 3 days.
* *Dynamic*: You select one processing time that applies if the variation is in stock, e.g. ready to be shipped within 3 days.
And you select another processing time that applies if the variation is not in stock, e.g. ready to be shipped within 2 weeks.

=== Static setting

You select a processing time that is always true for the variation, e.g. ready to be shipped within 3 days.

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Availability*.
. Select the appropriate availability level (symbols 1-10).
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Do you need to edit lots of variations?
====

If you want to save the availability for lots of variations, then it is probably fastest to do so via import, group function or batch processing.

* *_Data import_*:
Use the mapping field *Item variations / Availability*.
