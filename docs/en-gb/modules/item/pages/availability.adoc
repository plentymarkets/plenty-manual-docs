=== Procedure

This function is configured in two steps:

* xref:item:availabilities.adoc#100[Define the ten availability levels]
* xref:item:availabilities.adoc#150[Set the availability of each variation]

[#100]
== Defining the availability levels

Enter the availability texts one-time only in the plentymarkets back end. You can also replace the default availability icons with your own icons.

[.instruction]
Setting the availability options:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Availability*.
. Carry out the settings. Note <<table-define-availability>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

|Setting |Explanation

| *ID*
|The IDs 1-10 are automatically assigned by plentymarkets and cannot be changed.

*_Use case_*: Imagine you want to xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#550[import lots of item data with the help of a CSV file]. Among other things, you want to specify the availability of each item. You can use the IDs 1-10 to specify the availability of each item.

| *Backend icon*
|The system’s availability icons are displayed here. These icons are set by default and can be replaced with individual icons.

| *Name*
|Enter a name or a description for the delivery time, e.g. ships within 48 hours, 3-5 business days, etc.

*_Tip_*: Choose a different language from the drop-down list if you want to save the availability texts in multiple languages.

| **Average delivery period**
|Enter the average delivery time in days. These values will be analysed by search engines.

*_Tip_*: Enter realistic delivery times, as this information is considered to be a promise and it is also relevant in terms of competition law.

| *Online store icon*
|Here you’ll see three buttons.
Click on the button on the far left to open a detailed view of the symbol.

== Setting the availability of a variation

Manually::
+
--
If you only want to save the availability for a few variations, then it makes sense to do this manually.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. Click on the *Settings* tab in the lower row and find the *Availability* area.
. Select the appropriate availability level (symbols 1-10).
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

--
Import::
+
--
If you want to save the availability for lots of variations, then it makes sense to do this via import.
Use the mapping field *Item variations / Availability* to do so.

Group function or batch processing::
+
--
If you want to save the availability for lots of variations, then it makes sense to do this with the variation group function or batch processing.

[discrete]
===== Variation group function

include::page$mass-processing.adoc[tag=variation-group-function]

. Activate the option with the symbols 1-10 (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and select the appropriate availability level (icon:dot-circle-o[role="blue"]).
. Click on icon:execute[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"] *Execute* to apply the settings to the variations.

[discrete]
===== Batch processing

include::page$mass-processing.adoc[tag=variation-batch-processing]

. On the right, activate the option with the symbols 1-10 (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and select the appropriate availability level (icon:dot-circle-o[role="blue"]).
. Click on icon:execute[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"] *Apply* to apply the settings to the variations.

[TIP]
.Does the availability depend on the stock level?
====
The availability is a static setting.
In other words, the availability level selected in the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Availability » Symbols 1-10* does not change depending on the actual stock level.

Alternatively, you can have the availability change dynamically.
In other words, you can have one availability level when the item is in stock and another availability level when the item is sold out.
This automation is configured in the warehouse settings.

. Go to *Setup » Stock » Warehouse » [Open warehouse] » Settings*.
. Select the appropriate availability level (symbols 1-10) for the settings *Availability with stock* and *Availability without stock*.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"]) the settings.
