== General questions

[.collapseBox]
.*What does PIM mean?*
--

include::item:partial$item-introduction.adoc[tag=pim-preamble]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*What’s the difference between items and variations?*
--

You can think of items as data containers.
They always include one or more variations.
That is, one or more saleable versions of a product.

*_Example_*: You sell a shirt in the sizes 50, 52 and 54.

* All of the sizes together form the item.
* Each individual size is a variation of the item.

[.collapseBox]
.*What does the term "Inheritance" mean?*
--

include::page$inheritance.adoc[tag=inheritance-preamble]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I just booked a test system. Where can I see a few example items?*
--

Your plentymarkets system includes several example items and variations.
This example data helps you learn how items and variations are structured before you start entering your own data.

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Choose *filters* in the left column.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The search results are displayed in an overview on the right.

xref:item:search.adoc#[Further information].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I don’t understand a field in the item data record. Can I look up its function?*
--

//ToDo - sobald die neue Artikel-UI als standard eingebunden wird, dann den Link anpassen, damit es zur neuen Verzeichnis-Seite weiterleitet und auch den Text ab Satz 2 als include einbinden aus der Intro der neuen Verzeichnis-Seite

Yes.
Take a look at the xref:item:import-export-create-directory.adoc#[directory of data fields].
This page serves as a reference.
It explains the various tabs and data fields within an item data record.
Links direct you to further information and step-by-step instructions for using the individual data fields in a larger context.

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I limit which item data my employees can edit? They shouldn’t be able to change sensitive information.*
--

//ToDo - sobald die neue Artikel-UI als standard eingebunden wird, dann stattdessen die Frage aus der Seite artikel:verzeichnis (FAQ Kapitel) nehmen und als include an beide Stellen einbinden

Yes.
People with back end access rights can only manage items, if an admin has granted them access:

. Find someone who has administrator rights for the plentymarkets system.
. This person will open the menu *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*.
. Then they will open the user account and grant the necessary rights.
* *_Tip_*: Which exact rights you need to activate depends on what exactly the employee should be able to do.
Below you can find an example of useful rights for an employee in the content department.
* *_Tip_*: Before you grant employees rights across the board, you should test the configuration in a back end user account and make sure it meets your needs.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"]) the settings.
. If the problem persists, contact our link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/c/item/18[support team in the forum^].

== Prices

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I save different prices for each variation?*
--

Yes.
Prices are saved for each individual variation, and not for the item as a whole.
Example: if you sell a t-shirt in S, M, L and XL, then you can decide whether the XL variation should be a bit more expensive than the rest.

xref:item:prices.adoc#900[Further information].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can my prices vary depending on the situation? For example, can a product cost a bit less on specific markets or for specific customers?*
--

Yes.
Sales prices define the conditions under which a variation is sold at a specific price. For example, you can sell products for a lower price in the plentyShop than on Amazon. Or you can sell products cheaper to B2B customers than to B2C customers.

xref:item:prices.adoc#[Further information].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*My supplier sent me a list of new purchase prices. How do I import the new purchase prices?*
--

//Frage ist auch im Bereich Massenbearbeitung zu finden.

plentymarkets has an import tool.
The idea is simple.
Rather than manually saving information in plentymarkets, you’ll gather the same information in a CSV file and then import this file into your system.

* xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[Further information about the import tool].
* xref:videos:importing-data-with-elasticsync.adoc#[Video tutorial with example for importing purchase prices].
* xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#2450[Directory of available matching and mapping fields].

[.collapseBox]
.*I want plentymarkets to automatically calculate my prices for me. Is that possible?*
--

include::page$prices.adoc[tag=faq-price-calculation]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*An item was sold for the wrong price. How can I tell who changed the price and when?*
--

include::page$prices.adoc[tag=faq-change-history]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*How do I display the RRP as a strikethrough price in the webshop?*
--

include::page$prices.adoc[tag=faq-strikethrough-price]

.*I’m required to display the lowest price of the last 30 days. How do I do that?*

== Attributes

[.collapseBox]
.*Characteristics, properties and attributes: what’s the difference?*
--

include::page$attributes.adoc[tag=faq-attribute-property-characteristic]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*My attributes can’t be deleted. Why not?*
--

include::page$attributes.adoc[tag=faq-attribute-delete]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I don’t see the option “Market attribute link”. Where is it?*
--

include::page$attributes.adoc[tag=market-attribute-link]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I accidentally deleted my attributes. Can I restore them?*
--

include::page$attributes.adoc[tag=faq-attribute-restore]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I retroactively add attributes to my variations?*
--

include::page$attributes.adoc[tag=faq-add-attribute-existing-item]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I want to create variations. But I’m not being shown all of the attributes to choose from. What’s the problem?*
--

While creating the item, you probably chose attributes for the main variation.
Although this is technically possible, it is not recommended.

* *_Why?_*:
If you link attributes while creating a new item, then all of the following variations will have to be created from the same attributes too.
This is not the case if you do not link attributes while creating the item.
In other words, it makes you much more flexible in the future.
* *_What can you do now?_*:
** If you’ve recently created the item and haven’t started selling it yet, then it’s probably easiest to delete the item and create it again.
** If you’ve already started selling the item, i.e. it has stock and it was already ordered, then it probably makes sense to create a new item so that you don’t run into any problems with pending orders and existing stock levels.

--

//Sobald die Limits pro Edition variieren, müsste das angepasst werden.

[#500]
== Item texts and images

[.collapseBox]
.*How many images can I upload per item?*
--

* *Item » Edit item*:
Do you use this menu?
Then you can upload up to 100 images per item, i.e. per item ID.
This is a hard limit in the user interface.
If you were to upload e.g. 150 images, then only the first 100 would appear in the user interface.
Note that the limit applies to the entire item, i.e. to all of the variations together.
* *Item » Item UI*:
Do you use this menu?
Then you can upload as many images as you want.
There is no limit in this menu.
But keep in mind that lots of images require lots of performance.
Having too many images can negatively affect your system's performance.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I need to upload lots of images. How do I do that most efficiently?*
--

//denk auch an die fast gleiche Frage under Massenbearbeitung

. Save the item images on a webspace of your choice, e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive or similar.
The images saved there need to be accessible via URL.
. Use a CSV file to import the item images.
In the CSV file, you’ll match the item ID to the corresponding images and their positions.

*_Input format_*:
`Image1url;positionImage1,Image2url;positionImage2`

*_Example CSV file_*:
[cols="1,4a"]

|Item ID	|Image URLs

.*Can the image change in the plentyShop depending on which colour a customer chooses?*
--

include::page$attributes.adoc[tag=attribute-images-dynamic]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Not all of my items have an image. How do I control which placeholder image is displayed for them in the plentyShop?*
--

//diese Frage ist auch im Bereich plentyShop zu finden

. Go to *Setup » Item » Images » Settings*. +
→ The menu is divided into several areas.
. Carry out the settings in the *Placeholder images* section.
This area relates to placeholder images.
If an item does not have its own image, then the placeholder image will be displayed instead.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

include::page$images.adoc[tag=itemimages-placeholder]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I want to customise my image URLs. How do I do that?*
--

include::page$images.adoc[tag=personalise-itemimage-urls-preamble]

xref:item:images.adoc#200[Further information].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I want to change an item’s descriptive text. How do I do that?*
--

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Texts*.
. Choose the appropriate language from the left drop-down list.
. Enter the item texts in this language.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

xref:item:import-export-create-directory.adoc#50[Further information].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I save variation-specific texts?*
--

The texts that are saved in the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Texts* apply to the entire item. In other words, the texts apply to all of the variations.
It’s also possible to save variation-specific texts.

. First, you’ll create xref:item:properties.adoc#500[properties] of the type *Text* or *HTML*.
. Then you’ll xref:item:properties.adoc#1400[link these properties] with the appropriate variations.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Practical example: my manufacturer renamed a part. How do I change the name in all of my item texts?*
--

The search & replace function helps you globally change a word or phrase in all of your item texts.
You search for a specific item text in the database and replace the results with a new text.

.*I don’t understand a mapping field for the import. Can I look up its function?*
--

Yes.
Take a look at the xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#[directory of matching and mapping fields].
This page serves as a reference.
It explains the various fields that are available when importing item and variation data.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I use a REST-API interface for exchanging data with plentymarkets?*
--

Yes.
Essentially the REST-API lets you use external calls for sending data to the plentymarkets system or retrieving data from the system.

[.collapseBox]
.*I already sell on Amazon but I’m new to plentymarkets. Can I import my item data from Amazon?*
--

TIP: There’s no way to directly transmit your item data from Amazon to plentymarkets.
You’ll have to use a workaround.
If you already sell on eBay, then it will be much easier for you to import your item data from eBay rather than from Amazon.

. Export your item data from Amazon.
How exactly you export the data is up to you.
For example, if you want to request a so-called "reverse feed" file or use a different method.
. Use the import tool to import the data into plentymarkets.
.. Make sure that the import file includes all of the mandatory fields for new items and variations.
.. Match the information in your file with the corresponding data fields in plentymarkets.

If you’re not familiar with the import tool yet, then you should take a look at the various xref:item:faq-pim.adoc#400[support materials].
There you will find detailed instructions and practical examples.

.*I already sell on eBay but I’m new to plentymarkets. Can I import my item data from eBay?*
--

Yes.
There’s a tool that you can use to import your eBay listings into the system and create items.

. Create the property.
. Link the property to the appropriate variations.
. Display the property in your plentyShop.

xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Further information].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*How can I display a cross-selling list in my plentyShop?*
--

In just two steps, you can generate additional sales through cross-selling:

. First, open the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Cross-selling* and create the cross-selling links.
In other words, decide which items should be linked together.
. Then publish the cross-selling list in the plentyShop.
In other words, add the widget *Item » Item list* and configure the widget settings.

== Specific use cases

[.collapseBox]
.*How can I find out which of my items are sold most often?*
--

Take a look at the “Tops/Flops” statistic.
It shows you which variations were sold most and least often during a specific time period.

xref:data:statistics.adoc#[Further information about the statistic].

[.collapseBox]
.*I want to offer customers a promotional gift or free give-away if they spend a certain amount of money. How do I do that?*
--

Create an event procedure, which automatically adds a promotional gift to orders exceeding a specific value.

xref:item:give-aways.adoc#[Further information about the process].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I sell items with serial numbers. Can plentymarkets track which serial number belongs to which order?*
--

Yes.
Every time you sell an item with a serial number, plentymarkets can keep a record of which copy was sold.

xref:item:serial-numbers.adoc#[Further information].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I sell items with an age restriction. Some items can only be purchased with proof of age 18+. What do I need to do?*
--

. First, open the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Global » Area: Basic settings* and select the appropriate age rating for every item.
. Then consider how items with an age rating of 18+ should be shipped.
You will need to link a shipping profile, which has the option *PostIdent* activated.
