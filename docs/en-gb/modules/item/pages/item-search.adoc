======
This page describes the new item UI, which was released as a closed beta phase in September, 2021.

* Closed beta means that the new item UI will initially be tested by a small group of participants.
* Once the new item UI is sufficiently developed, the open beta phase will begin.
* For further information, refer to link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/neue-artikel-ui-teilnehmer-fuer-geschlossene-beta-gesucht-new-item-ui-participants-wanted-for-closed-beta/649947[this forum thread]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

| icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]
|
////
Activates/deactives the advanced search mode.

*_Standard vs. Advanced search_*:

* The standard search mode is easier to use, but it’s also less flexible.
* The advanced search mode supports <<item/new-ui/search#intable-advanced-elements, links>>, <<item/new-ui/search#intable-advanced-elements, AND/OR relationships>> and <<item/new-ui/search#intable-advanced-elements, operators>>.
////

Advanced search mode:

. Go to *Item » New item UI*.
. Click on icon:filter[role="darkGrey"] and add filters as needed (icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]).
. Click on *Advanced* (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]). +
→ The advanced search mode appears.
. Use the advanced filter options to narrow down the search results:
.. Select the search relationship *AND* or *OR*.
.. Link the search fields as needed (icon:link[role="darkGrey"]).
.. Select the operator.
. Once you’ve started the search, click on a line in the results to open the <<item/new-ui/detail-view#, detail view>>.
There you can modify the item’s settings.

*_Note_*:
All of the advanced search elements will be reset when you deactivate the advanced search mode.
<<item/new-ui/search#900, Further information>>.

2+|[#intable-advanced-elements]*Advanced elements*

| *AND*; +
*OR*
|Do you want to search for products that fulfil one or both of the criteria?
Select the appropriate search relationship from the drop-down list.

[cols="1,4a"]
!===
!Relationship !Explanation

! *AND*
! The product must fulfil _both criteria_.
Example: Search for items that ship within 24 hours AND are listed on the platform eBay.

! *OR*
! The product must fulfil _one of the criteria_.
Example: Search for items that are supplied by the company A OR B.
Filters are automatically linked together if you select the OR relationship (further information below).

!===

| icon:link[role="darkGrey"]
|Search filters can be linked together to show how they relate to each other.
This is equivalent to adding parentheses to a formula.
Example:
//Compare the following two examples:

* `A AND (B OR C)`
//* `(A AND B) OR C`

On the one hand, filters are linked and separated when you click on icon:link[role="darkGrey"].
On the other hand, filters are automatically linked when you select the OR relationship.

You can tell which filters are linked because a black line is displayed on the left and parentheses are displayed up top.

image::item/new-ui/assets/join-filters.png[]

| *Operator*
|Select the appropriate operator.

*_Tip_*: Add the same filter several times to create a range of values.
Example: Search for items that have an ID _greater_ than 100 and _less_ than 200.

[cols="1,4a"]
!===
!Operator !Explanation

! *EQUAL*
! Is equal to.
Example: Search for the item with the ID 100.

! *LIKE*
! Contains.
Example: Search for all of the items that have an ID containing the number 100, e.g. 1001, 410037, 100, 32100.

! *GREATER THAN*
! Greater than.
Example: Search for all of the items that have an ID greater than 100, e.g. 101, 102, 103.

! *GREATER OR EQUAL*
! Greater than or equal to.
Example: Search for all of the items that have an ID greater than or equal to 100, e.g. 100, 101, 102, 103.

! *LESS THAN*
! Less than.
Example: Search for all of the items that have an ID less than 100, e.g. 97, 98, 99.

! *LESS OR EQUAL*
! Less than or equal to.
Example: Search for all of the items that have an ID less than or equal to 100, e.g. 97, 98, 99, 100.

!===

2+| *Filter*

| *Variation IDs*
|Enter one or more IDs to search for the variations with these IDs.

*_Note_*:
Use commas without spaces to separate multiple IDs.
Example: `1001,1002,1003`

//kann sein, dass es irgendwann mit Leerzeichen zwischen den Kommas auch geht, also soll diese Stelle regelmäßig geprüft werden

| *Item ID*
|Enter an ID to search for the item with this ID.

| *Variation number*
|Enter a variation number to search for the variation with this number.

| *Type*
|Do you want to search for a particular type of item?
This filter limits the search results so that they only include default items, <<item/use-cases/combining-products#, sets or multipacks>>.

*_What about item bundles?_*
It’s also possible to search for item bundles or individual bundle components.
Use the <<item/new-ui/search#intable-bundle, Bundle>> filter to do so.

| *Main variation*
| * *Yes* = The search results only include <<item/introduction/structure#600, main variations>>.
* *No* = The search results only include <<item/introduction/structure#600, sub-variations>>.

| *Availability*
|Select an availability level from the drop-down list.
The search results only display products that are <<item/managing-items#200, linked to this availability level>>.

|[#intable-bundle]*Bundle*
|Do you want to search for <<item/use-cases/combining-products#, item bundles>> or individual bundle components?

* *Yes* = The search results will only include items and variations that are the _main item of a bundle_.
* *No* = The search results will include items and variations that are neither the main item nor a component of a bundle.
* *Component* = The search results will only include items and variations that are _components of a bundle_.

| *Client (store)*
|Select a client (store) from the drop-down list.
The search results only display products that are <<item/managing-items#360, linked to this client>>.

| *Sales price*
|Select a sales price from the drop-down list.
The search results only display products that are <<item/managing-items#240, linked to this sales price>>.

*_Requirement_*: Have you already <<item/settings/prices#, configured sales prices in plentymarkets>>?
This drop-down list only includes the sales prices that already exist in plentymarkets.

| *Supplier*
|Select a supplier from the drop-down list.
The search results only display products that are <<item/managing-items#310, linked to this supplier>>.

*_Requirement_*: Have you already <<crm/managing-contacts#100, created supplier data records in plentymarkets>>?

When you start a search, you’ll see the results in an overview.
The overview provides information about the items at a glance.
For example, you can see an image of the item, whether the item is active or inactive, its IDs, prices, tags and timestamps.
From here, you can:

* click on an item ID to open the item level.
* click somewhere else in the line to open the variation level.
* select multiple items (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and click on the pencil icon (icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"]).

[.collapseBox]
.*I don't see a drop-down list with views in the upper right corner. Why not?*
--

Have you already <<item/new-ui/search#500, opened an item data record>>?
The drop-down list with views (default view and custom views) is _not visible in the overview_.
It only appears once you have opened an item data record.

[#800]
=== Searching for items

[.collapseBox]
.*What are the default search settings? Are only active items searched by default?*
--

No filters are set by default.

* If you start the search without setting any filters, then all items will appear in the results.
* Both active and inactive items are included in the search results by default.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I use the same search filter multiple times?*
--

Yes.
If needed, add the same filter several times (icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]).
For example, you could add the "Item ID" filter twice if you want to search for the IDs 123 and 125.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I import and export the search filter settings?*
--

There is not currently an import / export function.
However, you can <<item/new-ui/search#200, save your frequently used search settings>>.

--

[#900]
=== Advanced search

[.collapseBox]
.*What’s the difference between the standard search mode and the advanced search mode?*
--

* The standard search mode is easier to use, but it’s also less flexible.
* The advanced search mode supports <<item/new-ui/search#intable-advanced-elements, links>>, <<item/new-ui/search#intable-advanced-elements, AND/OR relationships>> and <<item/new-ui/search#intable-advanced-elements, operators>>.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Advanced mode: What happens if I use both AND and OR relationships within the same group?*
--

The search query `(A AND B OR C)` will be interpreted as `A AND (B OR C)`.
It is not currently possible to use double parentheses.

//What is the grouping `(A AND B OR C)` good for?
//It is not currently possible to use multiple sets of parentheses.
//In other words, it’s not possible to write a search query like this:
//`[A AND (B OR C)] AND [D AND (E OR F)]`.
//Rather, it needs to be written like this:
//`(A AND B OR C) AND (D AND E OR F)`.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*What happens if I use the advanced search and switch back to the standard search mode?*
--

All of the advanced search elements will be reset.
This is because the standard search mode does not support links, AND/OR relationships and operators.
The elements will be reset as follows:

* All of the links will be removed.
* All of the relationships will be set to AND.
* All of the operators will be set to EQUAL.

--
