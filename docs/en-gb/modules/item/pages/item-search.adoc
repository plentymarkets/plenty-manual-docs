==== Search filters

[cols="1,4a"]
|====
|Filter |Explanation

| *Full text search*
|Enter item data, e.g. the item’s name, model, or an appropriate keyword.
The search results display products that match this data.

*_Note_*: The following item parameters are searched:

* Item ID
* Variation ID
* Variation number
* Variation name
* Model
* Manufacturer (external name)
* Supplier item number
* Name 1, Name 2, Name 3
* Short description
* Description
* Technical data
* Meta keywords
* Barcodes

*_Note_*: This is an "and" filter.
That means, the search results will only list items that match all of the words entered.
For example, if you enter the words "Nike Sweatshirt Tracksuit", then you will only find items that match the terms "Nike" AND "Sweatshirt" AND "Tracksuit".

| *Availability*
|Select one or more availability levels from the drop-down list (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
The search results only display products that are linked to one of these xref:item:managing-items.adoc#200[availability levels].

|Select one or more clients (stores) from the drop-down list (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

[cols="1,4a"]
!===

| *Variation number*
|Enter a variation number to search for the variation with this number.

[cols="1,4a"]
!===

! *Is equal to (=)*
!
Example: Search for the variation with the number 100.

! *Contains (≈)*
!
Example: Search for all of the variations that have a number containing 100, e.g. 1001, 410037, 100, ABC-41003-D.

!===

!===

| *Has lowest price*
|Limits the search results to variations that either have a value saved in the field "lowest price of the last 30 days" or that do not.

*_Example of use_*:
Are you worried that you might have forgotten to save the lowest price of the last 30 days for some of your discounted products?

| *Categories*
|Click on icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] and select one or more categories from the category tree (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
The search results only display products that are sorted into this _exact_ category.

*_Note_*: If you select a main category, then the sub-categories _will not automatically_ be selected too.

*_Example_*:
Imagine you have the category path "Clothing » Tops » T-Shirts".
If you only select the main category "Clothing", then the sub-category "Clothing » Tops » T-Shirts" _will not be selected too_.
Your search query would only relate to items that are sorted into the main category "Clothing".

*_How do I select sub-categories?_*:
Click on icon:chevron-right[role="darkGrey"] to open a main category and see its sub-categories.

*_Note_*: This is an "or" filter.
That means, the search results will only list items that are included in all of the categories entered.

*_Example of use_*:
You can also receive a list of variations, which are linked to sales channel A but not to sales channel B.
To do so, use this filter together with the filter *Linked to sales channel*.

| *Attributes*
|Click on icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] and select one or more attribute values from the tree structure (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

== FAQ

[.collapseBox]
.*What are the default search settings? Are only active items searched by default?*
--

No filters are set by default.

* If you start the search without setting any filters, then all items will appear in the results.
* Both active and inactive items are included in the search results by default.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*I modified an item. But the search results didn't change accordingly. Why not?*
--

The ElasticSearch index is used for the search.
This means, the data first needs to be saved in the index after a change has been made.
This can take up to 5 minutes.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*The overview of results is missing a piece of information that is relevant for me. Can I customise the table?*
--

Yes.
You can customise the overview to meet your needs.
xref:item:item-search.adoc#530[Further information].

.*The item ID is displayed in the left navigation bar. Can I display other info instead?*
--

Yes.
You can decide which information should be displayed in the left navigation bar.
