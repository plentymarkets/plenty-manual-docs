== Creating new units

Units help you define the size or measurements of your products.
There are 52 units saved according to their ISO code in plentymarkets by default.
However, you can create additional units of measure as needed.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Units*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]. +
→ A pop-up window opens. This window is divided into several steps.
. Carry out the settings in each step.

[TIP]
.Units can not be created via import
====
Units can only be created manually, as described here in the instructions.
It is not possible to create units with the import tool.

*_Example of use_*:
Units can be displayed in the back end, e.g. sorted by their position number.

| *Decimal numbers*
|Should decimal numbers be allowed for this unit of measure?

*_Example of use_*:
For example, half a litre makes sense.
But half a container would not make sense.

|Setting |Explanation

| *ID*
| The unit ID is automatically assigned and cannot be changed.
It is used to uniquely identify your units.

*_Use case_*: Unit links can be imported.
For example, while you import item and variation data, you can also directly link the appropriate units.
This is done, e.g. by specifying the unit ID.

| *Name DE* +
*Name FR* +
*Name IT* +
etc.
|Is your plentyShop available in multiple languages?
The variation’s content and unit is visible to customers in the plentyShop, e.g. 1 piece, 500 grams, 2.4 litres, etc.
If your online store is available in multiple languages, then the unit names should also appear in these languages.

. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] and select a language version from the drop-down list.
. Enter a translation of the name.

== Specifying the unit and content of your variations

Once you have finished initially configuring the units, you can link them to variations.
This can be done manually or via import.

[.collapseBox]
.*Manually*
--

If you only want to specify the content for a few variations, then it makes sense to do this manually.

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Dimensions » Option: Content*.
. Enter a number into the field on the left.
. Select a unit from the drop-down list on the right.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Import*
--

If you want to specify the content for lots of variations, then it makes sense to do this via import.

. Go to *Data » Import*.
. Create a new import of the type *Item*.
. Use the mapping fields:
* xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#1810[Content value] and xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#1800[Content unit]. +
+
or
* xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#1810[Content value] and xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#1820[Content measuring unit (ISO)].

xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[Further information about the import tool in general].

== Combining units to generate variations

You can create variations by combining units with different quantities.
Example: A bottle of soap that’s available in 100ml, 250ml and 500ml.

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Variations*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New*. +
→ The *Create new variations* window opens.
. In the *Content* field, enter the quantity and unit for the first variation, e.g. 100ml.
. Click on terra:execute[role="darkGrey"] *Create variations*.
. Repeat the procedure for 250ml and for 500ml.

[#300]
== Displaying the unit price on sales channels and labels

Surely you’ve seen an item’s unit price displayed on a store shelf.
The unit price tells you how much the item costs per kilogram, litre or other unit of measure.
It’s calculated based on the variation’s unit, content and price.

*_Background info_*:
A new link:https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/P-R/novelle-der-preisangabenverordnung-pangv.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4[regulation on specifying prices^] went into effect on May 28th, 2022.
§ 4 states that sellers, who offer products based on weight, volume, length or area, are required to indicate the unit price.
The unit price must be specified per 1 kilogram, 1 litre, 1 cubic metre, 1 metre or 1 square metre.

---

*_What sellers need to do_*:

The unit price can be displayed in the plentyShop, on sales channels like Amazon and eBay or on item labels.

[.collapseBox]
.*plentyShop*
--

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Dimensions » Option: Content*.
* Make sure that a numerical value was entered and that an option was selected from the drop-down list.
. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Sales prices*.
* Make sure that a price was entered.
. Go to *CMS » ShopBuilder » [Open content]*
* Make sure that the widget *Item / Item price* is included in the layout.

[TIP]
According to § 5 of the link:https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/P-R/novelle-der-preisangabenverordnung-pangv.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4[regulation on specifying prices^], the unit price must be specified per 1 kilogram or 1 litre.
But that doesn’t mean that you can only enter kilograms or litres into the plentymarkets back end.
You can also enter grams or millilitres.
plentymarkets will convert the values into kilograms or litres and display the result in the plentyShop.
Example: A variation that has a unit price of 1.20 EUR / 100 gram will automatically be displayed as 12 EUR / kilogram in the plentyShop.

.*Sales channels*

Refer to the following pages of the manual for instructions on displaying the unit price on a marketplace:

* xref:markets:preparing-variations.adoc#860[Amazon]
* xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#4000[eBay]
* xref:markets:otto-market.adoc#1302[OTTO]
* xref:markets:plus-gartenxxl.adoc#365[Netto]

[.collapseBox]
.*Item labels*
--

You’ll design your labels with the help of templates.
Each template includes information about the size of the label, which data should be displayed on the label and where each piece of data should be positioned on the label.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Labels*.
. Expand the template (icon:plus-square-o[role="darkGrey"]).
. Find the field *Unit price* and make sure that X/Y coordinates were entered here.
