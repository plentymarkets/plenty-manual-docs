This page serves purely as a reference.
It explains the various tabs and data fields within an item data record.
Links direct you to further information and step-by-step instructions for using the individual data fields in a larger context.

[IMPORTANT]
.Settings differ for each item type
====
Depending on which xref:item:new-item.adoc#intable-type[type of item] you’re working with, you might see some of the settings described on this page and not others. Don’t worry!
plentymarkets automatically displays the settings that are relevant to your item type and hides the rest.
====

[discrete]
=== Tab: Item ID

When you open an item, the item's ID is displayed in the tab by default.
But you can decide if you’d rather see the item’s name or number in the tab.
Of course you can change this setting again any time.

image::item:item-id.png[]

[.instruction]
Customising the item tab:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open an item. +
→ The item data record opens in a new tab.
. Right-click on the item tab. +
→ A drop-down list opens.
. Click on icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] *Rename*. +
→ The *Select tab title* window opens.
. Decide which data should be displayed.
. Click on terra:save[role="green"] *Save*.

TIP: If you select the setting *Variation name of main variation* or *Variation number of main variation* and this information is not saved for an item, then the *Item ID* will be shown instead.

TIP: The item's tab title only changes once you have reloaded the item.

An item is a complete data record that always includes one more more variations. An item is composed of general data that applies to all of the item variations (item data) as well as data that is managed separately for each variation (variation data).

In the item data record, you’ll find the item data displayed in the upper row of tabs and variation data displayed in the lower row of tabs.
In other words, the upper row of tabs includes general data that applies to all of the item’s variations.

image::item:upper-tab-row.png[]

[#40]
=== Global

This tab includes a wide range of basic item options.
Here you’ll also find a timestamp, which tells you when the item data record was created and when it was last modified.

[.instruction]
Saving global item data:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the item.
. Click on the *Global* tab in the upper row. This tab is divided into several areas.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

=== Tab: Variation ID

When you open a variation, the variation's ID is displayed in the tab by default.
But you can decide if you’d rather see the variation's name or number in the tab.
Of course you can change this setting again any time.


[.instruction]
Customising the variation tab:

TIP: The variation's tab title only changes once you have reloaded the item.

TIP: If the drop-down list doesn’t appear when you right-click, then switch to the tab of the main variation.

[#43]
=== Set

[IMPORTANT]
This tab is only visible for xref:item:new-item.adoc#intable-type[items of the type Set].

////

Open this tab to:

* xref:item:combining-products.adoc#3500[Add items to a set].
* Edit various xref:item:combining-products.adoc#3500[settings for the set].

[#45]
=== Multi-Channel

You’ll need to save settings in this tab if you’re preparing items to be sold on marketplaces like xref:markets:amazon.adoc#[Amazon], xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#[eBay] or xref:markets:neckermann-at-setup.adoc#[Neckermann.at].

[.instruction]
Saving settings for marketplaces:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the item.
. Click on the *Multi-Channel* tab in the upper row. This tab is divided into several areas.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

==== Amazon

These settings are only relevant if you want to xref:markets:amazon.adoc#[sell on Amazon].

==== Listing default settings

These settings relate to xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#5500[listing templates].
The basic idea is simple. Rather than individually configuring the settings for every single eBay, Hood or Ricardo offer, you create a template, which includes the typical offer settings.

[cols="1,3"]

*Store category 2*
|
include::partial$ebay-store-category.adoc[]

|====

==== eBay title

Enter the eBay listing’s title here. This links the listing title to the item.

*_Background info_*: Listings are retrieved on an hourly basis.
While being retrieved, the listing is assigned to an item.
xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#10400[Listings and items are matched] smoothly if the listing was created with plentymarkets or if the item has the same name as the listing title.

If the item name differs, you can enter the listing title.
This improves the matching accuracy.
This link also makes it possible to import listings that were set up with other tools into plentymarkets and have them automatically assigned to the correct item.

==== Category link

////
Portlet fällt vermutlich weg in die neue Artikel-UI, da Rakuten DE geschlossen ist
////

This setting is only relevant if you sell on Rakuten.
Here you’ll link the item with a Rakuten category.

Either enter the category ID directly into the text field. Or choose a main category from the drop-down list and then use the pop-up window to figure out the category ID.

==== Neckermann.at Enterprise

////
zukunftsmusik - ausführlicher machen
////

These settings are only relevant if you want to xref:markets:neckermann-at-setup.adoc#[sell on Neckermann.at].

[#50]
=== Texts

In this tab, you’ll save item texts like a preview text, technical data and keywords.

[TIP]
.Would you rather save variation-specific texts?
====
The texts in this tab apply to the entire item. In other words, the texts apply to all of the variations.
It’s also possible to save variation-specific texts.

. First, you’ll create xref:item:properties.adoc#500[properties] of the type *Text* or *HTML*.
. Then you’ll xref:item:properties.adoc#1400[link these properties] with the appropriate variations.
====

[.instruction]
Saving item texts:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the item.
. Click on the *Texts* tab in the upper row.
. Choose the appropriate language from the left drop-down list.
. Enter the item texts in this language.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-enter-item-texts]]
.Entering item texts
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Language*
|Select a language from the drop-down list *Open language*. This allows you to see and edit the item texts for this language.
The same language is automatically selected under *Save as*.

*_Alternative workflow_*:
While translating, you may find it helpful to initially see the source text and then overwrite it with your translation.
To do so, proceed as follows.

. Select the source language from the drop-down list *Open language*.
. Overwrite the source text with your translation.
. Select the target language from the drop-down list *Save as*.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the changes.

| *Delete language texts*
|Deletes all of the text fields for whichever language was selected under *Open language*.
You will be asked to confirm your decision.

| *Name 1*
|
include::partial$name1.adoc[]

| *Name 2*
|
include::partial$name2.adoc[]

| *Name 3*
|
include::partial$name3.adoc[]

| *Preview text*
|
include::partial$preview-text.adoc[]

| *Item text*
|
include::partial$item-text.adoc[]

| *Technical data*
|
include::partial$technical-data.adoc[]

| *URL path*
|The item’s *URL path* in the plentyShop.
By default, the URL path consists of the categories and the item name.
plentymarkets automatically assigns the path when the item is created. The path is displayed as part of the URL when the item is viewed in the plentyShop.

| *Meta description*
|
include::partial$meta-description.adoc[]

| *Meta keywords*
|
include::partial$meta-keywords.adoc[]

| *Item template*
|Not recommended. It’s technically possible to select a xref:item:callisto-templates.adoc#[template] to alter the design of the detail view of an item.
However, we don’t recommend doing so for two reasons:

* Item templates overwrite your “normal” product pages and are therefore not particularly useful in real life situations.
* This procedure is more complicated than link:https://vimeo.com/360260315[designing product pages with ShopBuilder] (see German video starting from minute 12:17).
|====

[#70]
=== Fields

////
zukunftsmusik - die Beschreibungen hier und unter vorbereitende Einstellungen etwas ausführlicher machen
////

Add free text fields to the detailed view of an item. Customers can then enter values into the free text fields, such as an additional request or dimensions.

Once you’ve xref:item:free-text-fields.adoc#[defined free text fields], you’ll activate them here for the appropriate items.

[.instruction]
Activating free text fields:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the item.
. Click on the *Fields* tab in the upper row.
. Enter the values into the required free text fields.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#80]
=== Characteristics

include::partial$link-characteristic-to-item.adoc[]

[#90]
=== Images

First, you’ll upload images of the item and its variations here. For example, you could upload images of a t-shirt in red, blue and green.
Then you’ll assign the images to the appropriate variations. This causes customers e.g. to automatically see an image of the green t-shirt when selecting this variation in the plentyShop.

[IMPORTANT]
.100 images can be uploaded per item
====
You can upload up to 100 images per item, i.e. per item ID.
This is a hard limit in the user interface.
If you were to upload e.g. 150 images, then only the first 100 would appear in the user interface.
Note that the limit applies to the entire item, i.e. to all of the variations together.
====

[#92]
[discrete]
==== Uploading images

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Images*.
. Drag & drop images into the appropriate area or click on terra:upload[role=purple] *Select files* and upload the images.
. Carry out the additional settings. Note <<table-upload-item-image>>.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-upload-item-image]]
.Uploading an item image
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *0*
|The first image automatically receives the position number 0. Additional images are then given the position numbers 1, 2, 3 etc.
Enter different position numbers if you want to sort the images in your plentyShop.
Alternatively, click on the symbols icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"] *Down* or icon:chevron-up[role="darkGrey"] *Up* to change the order of the images.

|[#intable-availability]*Availability*
|Which sales channels should this image appear on?
Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the appropriate clients and/or markets.

|[#intable-market-attribute-link]*Market attribute link*
|Select an attribute value to link the item image for marketplaces with this attribute value.
The image will only be transferred to marketplaces where item variations have this attribute value.

*_Note_*: This option is only shown if:

* xref:item:managing-items.adoc#94[the image is linked to at least one variation].
* xref:item:managing-items.adoc#intable-availability[you have made the images available for the marketplace].
* xref:item:attributes.adoc#intable-allow-image-link[you have allowed image links in the basic settings].

| *Alternative text*
|Enter an alternative text for the image.
If an image can not be displayed (e.g. due to the browser settings, firewall, etc.), then the customer will see the alternative text instead.
The alternative text is not relevant for SEO.
It is simply displayed as an alternative to the image.

*_Note_*:
The alternative text is limited to 256 characters.

| *Name*
|Enter a name for the image.
The name is relevant for SEO, i.e. it helps search engines index the item.
Use appropriate keywords in the image names to make the images more relevant to search engines.
This also increases traffic on the page, for example if the image is found with the Google image search.

*_Note_*:
The image name is limited to 256 characters.

| *Size*
|Displays the image size in pixels and kilo bytes.

===== Technical specifications

[cols="1,3"]
|====

| *File formats*
|The file formats supported for images are: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG

| *File names*
a|Image file names may contain the following characters:

* Letters (a-z, A-Z) excluding umlauts
* Numbers (0-9)
* Underscores (_)
* Hyphens (-)

Spaces and special characters such as umlauts are not permitted. When you upload images, spaces and special characters are replaced by hyphens (-).

| *Image sizes*
a|Every time an item image is uploaded, plentymarkets creates the following versions:

* High-resolution item image
* Medium-sized item image
* Item attribute image
* Two preview images

Since plentymarkets does not scale up images, the source image must have at least the size and quality specified in the xref:item:images.adoc#500[Sizes] area. Larger images will be scaled down to the specified size.

| *Original images*
|Original images are no longer accessible after they have been uploaded.
When you upload an image, plentymarkets uses it to generate the image sizes that are accessible via URL.
The original image will no longer be accessible - also not via URL.

|====

[#94]
[discrete]
==== Linking images with variations

Once you’ve uploaded the images, you’ll match them with the appropriate variations.
This causes customers e.g. to automatically see an image of a green t-shirt when selecting the green variation in the plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Linking images with variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Images*. +
→ You’ll see a list of all the images saved for the item.
. Select the images (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that you want to link.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *Variation link*. +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. If needed, use the filters on the left to find specific variations.
. Select whichever variations (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) you want to link to the chosen images.
. Click on icon:check[role="green"] *Link*. +
→ The images will be linked to the selected variations.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ If a customer selects the variation in the plentyShop, then he will automatically see the appropriate item image.

[TIP]
.Removing the link again
====
Underneath an image, click on icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"] *Variation link* to see which variations were linked to the image.
Select the variations (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that should no longer be linked and click on icon:exclamation-circle[role="darkGrey"] *Unlink*.
====

[TIP]
.Alternative: upload images in the lower row of tabs
====
Search for and open a variation. Then click on xref:item:managing-items.adoc#330[Images] in the lower row of tabs.
Here you can upload an image for the currently opened variation. In other words, the image is simultaneously uploaded and linked to the variation.
====

[#95]
=== Stock

////
zukunftsmusik - includes verwenden, um die inhalte auch hier anzuzeigen
////

In this tab:

* you’ll see an xref:stock-management:managing-stocks.adoc#400[overview of the item’s stock levels]. In other words, you’ll see how many copies of each variation are in stock.
* you can xref:stock-management:managing-stocks.adoc#700[reorder] items that are running out of stock.
* you can xref:stock-management:managing-stocks.adoc#500[redistribute stock], i.e. move stock to a different storage location.

This tab is no longer supported.
Files that you upload in this tab can not be used for the plentyShop.
Instead of uploading files in this tab, xref:item:properties.adoc#500[create a property] of the type "File".
====

This tab is only relevant for the outdated Callisto webshop.
Here you can upload files such as product information or brochures.
Your customers can then download these files from the product page or from the "my account" area.
The files that you upload in this tab must meet the following requirements:

* The file must be intended for the old Callisto webshop
* *_Permitted file formats_*: PDF, EXCEL, X_EXCEL, DOC, DOCX, MSWORD, RTF, TEXT, RICHTEXT, ZIP, HTML, SWF
* *_Maximum file size_*: 10 MB per file

An item is a complete data record that always includes one more more variations. An item is composed of general data that applies to all of the item variations (item data) as well as data that is managed separately for each variation (variation data).

In the item data record, you’ll find the item data displayed in the upper row of tabs and variation data displayed in the lower row of tabs.
In other words, the lower row of tabs contains data that applies to a specific variation.
Namely, the variation whose ID is currently displayed in the upper tab row.

Keep in mind that the xref:item:structure.adoc#300[main variation] can pass data onto its sub-variations, i.e. they can xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inherit] its data.
You can deactivate the inheritance function if you would prefer to modify the variations individually.

[#180]
=== Settings

This tab includes a wide range of basic options for the variation.
Here you’ll also find a timestamp, which tells you when the variation was created and when it was last modified.

==== Sales prices

Here you can link xref:item:prices.adoc#[existing sales prices] to the variation and enter monetary prices.
The monetary prices can be:

* manually entered for the variation.
* automatically calculated with the help of an xref:item:prices.adoc#1000[existing price calculation].

[tabs]
====
Manual entry::
+
--

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Sales prices*.
. Select the previously created xref:item:prices.adoc#[sales price] from the left drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The sales price is added and displayed in the list.
. Enter the monetary price into the *Price* field.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

--
Price calculation::
+
--

//tag::apply-price-calculation[]
. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Sales prices*.
. Choose a previously created xref:item:prices.adoc#1000[price calculation] from the right drop-down list.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Reload the item data record if needed. To do so, right-click on the item tab and then click on icon:undo[role="darkGrey"] *Reload*. +
→ The sales price and the automatically calculated monetary price will be displayed in the list.

[TIP]
.plentymarkets works with gross prices
====
Behind the scenes, plentymarkets works with gross prices.
Technically, you can use the middle drop-down list to decide whether you want gross prices or net prices to be displayed in the item data record.
But this only affects how the prices are displayed.
Only gross prices are saved internally in the database.
====

[TIP]
.Deleting the link again
====
Open the variation and click on *Delete* (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]) in the line of a sales price.
This deletes the link between the sales price and the variation.
The sales price itself is not deleted.
The sales price is simply removed from the variation.
Afterwards, the sales price will be available in the left drop-down list again.
====

[TIP]
.Inheritance behaviour
====
If xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inheritance] is active, then combinations of sales price and monetary price will be passed down from the main variation to the sub-variations.
If you want to maintain individual prices for the sub-variations, deactivate the inheritance and then add the sales price.
====

[#250]
==== Barcode

Barcodes such as GTIN, ISBN, UPC and QR are used to identify items in plentymarkets. Link xref:item:barcodes.adoc#[barcodes] with your item variations.

[.instruction]
Manually linking barcodes with variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. Click on the *Settings* tab in the lower row.
. In the *Barcode* area, select the xref:item:barcodes.adoc#100[previously saved barcode configuration] from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The barcode type is added and displayed in the list.
. Enter the code into the *Code* field.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Automatically assigning barcodes from the number range
====
If you bought a xref:item:barcodes.adoc#200[range of GTIN 13 barcodes], then plentymarkets can automatically assign the next available barcode to your item.

To do so, proceed as described above. Rather than manually entering the barcode into the *Code* field, click on *Generate GTIN* (terra:execute[role="darkGrey"]).

==== ASIN/ePID/MOIN

[cols="1,3a"]

|ID |Explanation

| *ASIN*
|The "Amazon Standard Identification Number" is a 10-digit, alphanumeric product identification that is provided by xref:markets:amazon-setup.adoc#[Amazon].
The ASIN and ISBN are identical for books.
The ASIN can be found on Amazon's product page.

| *ePID*
|The "eBay Product ID" is a product identification that is provided by xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#[eBay].

| *MOIN*
|The "My OTTO Identification Number" is an alphanumeric product identification that is provided by xref:markets:otto-market.adoc#[OTTO Market].
Starting August 11th, 2021, every product on OTTO Market must have a MOIN.

*_Note_*: The MOIN is assigned by OTTO Market.
You do not create it yourself.
If you sell a product on OTTO Market and it’s also available through other sellers, then all of the offers will have the same MOIN.
|====

[.instruction]
Manually linking the ASIN, ePID or MOIN with a variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: ASIN/ePID/MOIN*.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ A new entry is added to the list.
. Select *ASIN*, *ePID* or *MOIN* from the right drop-down list.
. If needed, select the country platform from the left drop-down list.
. Enter the ASIN, ePID or MOIN into the field.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

==== Tags

Here you can link the variation to any number of xref:item:flags.adoc#400[tags].

. Click in the text field.
. Select the tag from the drop-down list or enter the first few letters of the tag’s name and then use the auto-complete function.
. The tag will be linked to the variation when you save your changes. +
→ Use the xref:item:search.adoc#intable-tags[tag filter] to search for all of the variations that have this tag.

*_Note_*: Here you can only link the tags that were made available for the *Variation* area.

[TIP]
.Inheritance behaviour
====
Tags that you link to the main variation are passed on to the item’s other variations. To save other tags for a variation, deactivate inheritance and save different tags.

If you remove all tags from a variation, inheritance is not activated. This behaviour differs from other inheritance settings in the system. Instead, the variation is saved without any tags.

By default, the main variation’s properties and values are passed down to the sub-variations.
If you want to use other properties for the sub-variations, then deactivate the inheritance function and then link the property.

Properties and values are inherited all together. In other words, you can either have all or none of the values be inherited.

=== Availability

Where do you want to sell this variation? Answer the question by selecting the corresponding marketplaces and plentyShops.

[.instruction]
Choosing sales channels for the variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. Click on the *Availability* tab in the lower row. This tab is divided into several areas.
. Carry out the settings.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Additional availability settings
====
Note that there is also the xref:item:managing-items.adoc#200[Tab: Settings » Area: Availability], which you’ll use to specify when the variation should be visible or purchasable.
====

[#350]
==== Markets

Which marketplaces do you want to sell the variation on?

. Click in the text field and select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the appropriate marketplaces from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]).

[TIP]
.Your market isn’t in the list?
====
The drop-down list only includes active referrers.
So if you can’t find a specific market in the list, then open the menu *Setup » Orders » Order referrer* and make sure the market was activated (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
====

[TIP]
.The markets do not affect the online store.
====
The markets control the visibility on the marketplaces themselves.
They do not affect the visibility in the plentyShop.
There are a few different settings that control the visibility of an item in the plentyShop.
You can learn more about these settings in our xref:item:checklist-items-visibility.adoc#[checklist for item visibility in the plentyShop].
====

[#360]
==== Client (store)

With plentymarkets, you can manage several online stores, i.e. xref:online-store:setting-up-clients.adoc#[several clients], with only one software. Consequently, it is possible to manage several different areas of business with one plentymarkets system. That’s a great advantage. But it also means that you’ll always need to tell plentymarkets which online store a variation should appear in.

[.instruction]
Linking a client to the variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. Click on the *Availability* tab.
. Choose whichever store (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the variation should appear in.
. Save (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.


[TIP]
.Setting is greyed out? Check the stock level!
====
plentymarkets can automatically remove items from the plentyShop if they are no longer in stock.
This automatic process is controlled by the settings in xref:item:managing-items.adoc#200[Tab: Settings » Area: Availability].
More specifically, it’s controlled by the settings *Show in online store: Not available automatically if net stock is 0 or negativ* and *Client: Invisible automatically if net stock is 0 or negative*.

If one of these options is activated and the variation is no longer in stock, then the client setting here will be greyed out.
Reorder the variation to get it back in stock. Alternatively, click on the lock symbol (icon:lock[role="darkGrey"]) if you want to manually make the variation visible in the plentyShop despite the fact that it’s not in stock.

This setting remains valid until new stock is booked for the variation. Once net stock for the variation becomes positive, the availability and visibility settings if net stock is 0 or negative take effect again.
====

[#370]
==== SKU

Here you’ll add market-specific SKUs as needed.

. Click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The *New SKU* window opens.
. Select the referrer and the account if needed. +
*_Note_*: Not every marketplace has an account. In this case, the setting is greyed out.
. Enter the SKU.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *Add*.

[#2090]
=== Notes

In the *Notes* tab, you can save notes about a variation. Notes are only visible in your plentymarkets back end. In other words, notes are not displayed in the plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Saving a note:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. Click on the *Notes* tab in the lower row.
. Enter the note and format the text.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the note.

The xref:item:search.adoc#800[symbols in the item overview] help you quickly see whether a note was saved for the variation.
The symbols are found in the *Procedures* column:

* terra:order_note[role="blue"] = The variation has a note.
Click on this symbol to open a pop-up window where you can directly view and manage your notes.
* terra:order_note_create[role="green"] = The variation does not have a note yet.
Click on this symbol to open a pop-up window where you can directly save a new note.

Depending on how you configured the xref:item:search.adoc#intable-table-type[Table type] filter, this symbol either refers to the main variation or to a specific sub-variation.
In other words:

* Table type Item = There is only one note symbol per item. This symbol manages notes for the main variation.
* Table type Variations = There’s a separate note symbol for each variation.
