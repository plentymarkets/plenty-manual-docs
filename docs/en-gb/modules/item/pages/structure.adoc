Items are made up of lots of information, e.g. categories, prices, manufacturers, descriptive texts and images. To help you manage items, this data is divided into three levels:

* xref:item:structure.adoc#100[System settings]
* xref:item:structure.adoc#200[Items]
* xref:item:structure.adoc#250[Variations]

[#100]
== System settings

You can think of system settings as information that applies to multiple items.

*_Examples_*:

* Multiple items are sorted into the same category.
* Multiple items are manufactured by the same company.

.*Extended description*

Before you can sort an item into a category, the category first needs to exist in plentymarkets.
Before you can select an item’s manufacturer, the manufacturer data needs to exist in plentymarkets.

System settings can be thought of as xref:item:settings.adoc#[preparatory settings].
They are saved in plentymarkets one time and then applied to all of the corresponding items and variations.

//tag::system-settings-list[]
Some of the most important system settings are:

* xref:item:categories.adoc#[Categories], which group your products.
* xref:item:attributes.adoc#[Attributes], which simultaneously characterise your products and build variations.
* xref:item:properties.adoc#[Properties], which characterise your products without building variations.
* xref:item:prices.adoc#[Sales prices], which define the conditions under which a variation is sold at a specific price.
* xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1000[Shipping profiles], which define your shipping services and shipping costs.
* xref:item:manufacturers.adoc#[Manufacturers], which list the names, contact information, IDs and commissions saved for your manufacturers.
* xref:item:units.adoc#[Units], which define the content of your variations.

[#200]
== Items

You can think of items as data containers.
They always include one or more variations.

*_Example_*: You sell a shirt in the sizes 50, 52 and 54.

* All of the sizes together form the item.
* Each individual size is a variation of the item.

[.collapseBox]
.*Extended description*
--

An item is a complete data record that always includes one or more variations.
An item is composed of:

* general data that applies to all of the item variations (item data).
* data that is managed separately for each variation (variation data).

In the back end, items are left-aligned and variations are indented.

The difference between item data and variation data can be summarised as follows:

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Type of data |Examples of data on this level

| *Item data* +
(left-aligned)
|
* Basic settings (condition, manufacturer, shipping profiles etc.)
* Texts
* Settings for Amazon and eBay
* Cross-selling links

| *Variation data* +
(indented)
|
* Categories
* Properties
* Sales prices
* Measurements (Content / Dimensions)
* Availabilities
* Stock

//ToDo - sobald die neue UI zur Standard wird, dann erstens, lösche die alte-UI Infos unten und ersetze sie mit der neue-UI Infos oben - stelle dabei sicher, dass die neue UI-Infos zwischen den tags bleiben, da diese include weiter unten in die faq auch genutzt wird

In the data record, you’ll find the item data displayed in the upper row of tabs and variation data displayed in the lower row of tabs.

[#250]
== Variations

Saleable versions of a product.

*_Example_*: You sell a shirt in the sizes 50, 52 and 54.

* All of the sizes together form the item.
* Each individual size is a variation of the item.

//tag::build-variations-content-attributes[]

You can either form variations by creating different combinations of unit and quantity or by using attributes.

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Method |Explanation

| *Unit* +
*Content*
|Variations differ from each other in terms of quantity and unit, e.g.:

* Soap: 100ml, 250ml, 500ml

| *Attributes*
|Variations differ from each other in terms of their attribute values, e.g.:

* Throw pillow: Colour (red, black, grey) = 1 attribute
* T-Shirt: Colour (green, blue) and size (S, M, L, XL) = 2 attributes
* Shoes: Colour (black, brown) and size (38, 39, 40) and width (narrow, normal) = 3 attributes

.*Can I create items without any variations?*
--

Some items don’t come in different colours or sizes, i.e. they don’t have multiple variations. But an item on its own is not a saleable product. In other words, every item needs to have at least one variation. In plentymarkets, it’s not technically possible to create an item without any variations.
