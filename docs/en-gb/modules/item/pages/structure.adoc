Items are made up of lots of information, e.g. categories, prices, manufacturers, descriptive texts and images. To help you manage items, this data is divided into three levels:

* System settings
* Items
* Variations

You can think of _system settings_ as information that applies to multiple items. For example, multiple items are sorted into the same category or manufactured by the same company. System settings are saved in plentymarkets one time and then applied to all of the corresponding items and variations.

You can think of _items_ as data containers. They always include one or more _variations_, i.e. one or more saleable versions of a product. For example, if you sell a t-shirt in small, medium and large, then all of these sizes together form the item. Each individual size is a variation of the item.

In summary, the item structure is composed of three data levels:

== System settings

System settings can be thought of as xref:item:settings.adoc#[preparatory settings]. First they’re configured in the *Setup* menu and then they’re linked to items or variations.

For example, before you can sort an item into a specific category, the category first needs to exist in plentymarkets. And before you can select an item’s manufacturer, the manufacturer data needs to exist in plentymarkets.

//tag::system-settings-list[]
Some of the most important system settings are:

* xref:item:categories.adoc#[Categories], which group your products.
* xref:item:attributes.adoc#[Attributes], which simultaneously characterise your products and build variations.
* xref:item:properties.adoc#[Characteristics and properties], which characterise your products _without_ building variations.
* xref:item:prices.adoc#[Sales prices], which define the conditions under which a variation is sold at a specific price.
* xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1000[Shipping profiles], which define your shipping services and shipping costs.
* xref:item:manufacturers.adoc#[Manufacturers], which list the names, contact information, IDs and commissions saved for your manufacturers.
* xref:item:units.adoc#[Units], which define the content of your variations.

== Items and variations

[#300]
=== What are items made of?

An item is a complete data record that always includes one more more variations. An item is composed of general data that applies to _all_ of the item variations (item data) as well as data that is managed separately for each variation (variation data).

In the item data record, you’ll find the item data displayed in the upper row of tabs and variation data displayed in the lower row of tabs.

The difference between item data and variation data can be summarised as follows:

[[table-item-data-variation-data]]
.Item data and variation data
[cols="1,2"]

|Type of data |Examples of data on this level

| *Item data* +

a| * Global settings (condition, manufacturer, age rating, etc.)
* Texts
* Characteristics
* Cross-selling settings

| *Variation data* +
(lower row of tabs)
a| * Categories
* Properties
* Suppliers
* Stock
* Images
* Availabilities

=== How are variations created?

You can either form variations by creating different combinations of xref:item:units.adoc#[unit and quantity] or by using xref:item:attributes.adoc#[attributes].

[[table-creating-variations]]
.Creating variations
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Method |Explanation

| *Combination of unit/content*
a|Variations differ from each other in terms of quantity and unit, e.g.:

* Soap: 100ml, 250ml, 500ml

| *Combination of attribute values*
a|Variations differ from each other in terms of their attribute values, e.g.:

* Throw pillow: Colour (red, black, grey) = 1 attribute
* T-shirt: Colour (green, blue), size (S, M, L, XL) = 2 attributes
* Shoes: Colour (black, brown), size (5, 6, 7), width (narrow, normal) = 3 attributes

[#500]
=== Can I create items without any variations?

Some items _don’t_ come in different colours or sizes, i.e. they don’t have multiple variations. But an item on its own is not a saleable product. In other words, every item needs to have at least one variation. In plentymarkets, it’s not technically possible to create an item without any variations.

[#600]
=== What’s a main variation?

An item’s first variation is called its _main variation_. If an item has multiple variations, then the main variation can either be a saleable product or it can be a virtual data record. A virtual main variation is used to manage the other variations of the item with xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inheritance].

If you’re not happy with the current main variation, you can turn a different variation into the main variation.
