Some items stand out from the crowd. Be it a watch that is water resistant or a loudspeaker that has Bluetooth technology.
In plentymarkets, such distinguishing features are called properties and characteristics.
With the help of characteristics and properties, for example, you can:

* highlight the technical features of a product (e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).
* xref:item:frontend-item-search.adoc#[set up filters in your online store]. Your customers can then use these filters to refine the search results in the plentyShop (e.g. only see speakers that have Bluetooth technology).
* sell xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[personalised items].

.*Characteristics, properties and attributes: what’s the difference?*
--

* xref:item:properties.adoc#100[Characteristics] define _entire items_.
For example, if an item is available in red, blue or green, then the characteristic will apply to all three variations.
Characteristics aren’t very flexible, they’re outdated and they’re gradually being replaced by properties.
//Therefore, we recommend that you already start turning your characteristics into properties.
* xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Properties] define _specific variations_.
For example, if an item is available in red, blue or green, then the property can apply to one, two or all three of the variations.
Therefore, properties are much more flexible.
* xref:item:attributes.adoc#[Attributes], for example, are the various colours and sizes that your products are available in.
Attributes help you simultaneously characterise your products and create saleable variations, e.g. a t-shirt in the colour red and the size S.

//lass drin, könnte hilfreich sein als Erklärung Eigenschaft vs Attribute nachdem die Merkmale wegfallen
//Characteristics and properties are _passive features_ of an item. That means they are not linked to stock.
//Attributes, on the other hand, are used to generate saleable variations that can all have different stock levels. For example, the red variation might be sold out but the blue one is still available.

== Properties

You can create properties manually or import them with a CSV file.
This page describes the manual procedure.

[tabs]
====
Manual procedure::
+
--

. xref:item:properties.adoc#600[Create properties] and xref:item:properties.adoc#1200[sort them into group].
. xref:item:properties.adoc#1400[Link the properties] to the appropriate variations.
. xref:item:properties.adoc#1500[Display the properties in your plentyShop].

--
Import tool::
+
--

plentymarkets has an xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool], which you can use to import properties.
The idea is simple.
Rather than manually saving property data in plentymarkets, you’ll enter the same information into a CSV file and then import this file into your system.

. Create properties like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and group them.
You can do this with the import types xref:data:elasticSync-properties.adoc#[Properties] and xref:data:elasticSync-properties-selection-values.adoc#[Selection values].

. Link the properties to the appropriate variations. For example, link the Bluetooth property to your Bluetooth compliant products.
You can do this with the xref:data:elasticSync-item.adoc#2410[import type Item].

=== Grouping properties

If you have lots of properties, then you can group them together so that it’s easier to keep track of them in your plentymarkets back end.

[TIP]
.Example: grouping sales channels
====
Imagine you use some properties for the market Amazon and others for your plentyShop.
In this case, you could create one group called Amazon and another group called plentyShop.

There are two typical applications for property groups. On the one hand, if you have lots of properties, then you can group them together so that it’s easier to keep track of them in your plentymarkets back end.

On the other hand, property groups help you sell xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[personalised items] in your plentyShop.
You can use property groups to sort the additional options and services that you offer under one heading.

[TIP]
.Example: Group various trimmings
====
Imagine you sell wedding rings. Your customers can choose an optional gold or diamond trim for an additional fee.
You can create a property group called “Trim” to clearly display these options.
Within this group, customers can choose the options “Gold trim” or “Diamond trim”.

=== Linking properties with variations

[#1410]
==== Where to link?

Properties are linked in a different tab depending on their type.
Open the item data record and click on the tab *Properties* or *Texts* in the lower row. Which tab depends on the property type.

[cols="1,2", width=100%]
|====
|Property type |Where is the property linked?

|Text +
HTML
|<<item/managing-items#5000, Tab: Texts>>

|None +
Whole number +
Decimal number +
Selection +
Multi-selection +
Date +
File +
Character string
|<<item/managing-items#4800, Tab: Properties>>
|====

[#1420]
==== How to link?

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for] and open the variation.
. In the lower row of tabs, click on the tab *Properties* or *Texts*.
Which tab depends on the property type.
. Click on the *Properties* field. +
→ A drop-down list of available variation properties opens.
. Select the appropriate properties (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on Add (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The properties will be added.
. If necessary, add additional information about the property.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings. +

//check this to make sure it's true
[TIP]
.Inheritance
======
By default, properties and values are passed from the main variation to the sub-variations.
If you want to use other properties for the sub-variations, then deactivate the inheritance function and then link the property.

Properties and values are inherited all together. You can inherit either all or none of the values.
======

[#1440]
[discrete]
===== Saving additional information

Depending on the scenario, it might be necessary to save additional information. For example:

* If the property is something like a weight or a length, then it will be necessary to enter a numeric value.
* If the property is a product description for a specific variation, then the text will need to be entered.

*_Inheritance logic_*: The following logic applies when you delete a property link:
//test this to make sure it's true

* Are you removing the property from a _main variation_? Then the property will also be removed from all of the sub-variations that had previously inherited this property.
* Are you removing the property from a _sub-variation_ for which the inheritance function was activated? Then the inheritance function will be deactivated. The remaining properties will no longer be inherited. Rather, they will be saved directly for the sub-variation.
//* If you delete the property link of a _main variation_, the link and value are deleted for all variations of the item that inherit the properties of the main variation.

//If you delete the property link of a variation for which inheritance is active, inheritance is deactivated and the remaining properties are saved for this variation. +

| *Text*
|Enter up to 65,535 characters of plain text.

If you want to save the text in a different language, then choose this language from the drop-down list up top.

How your properties are displayed in the xref:online-store:setting-up-ceres.adoc#[plentyShop] depends on how you configured the settings with xref:online-store:shop-builder.adoc#[ShopBuilder]. This video provides a short demonstration (German only).
