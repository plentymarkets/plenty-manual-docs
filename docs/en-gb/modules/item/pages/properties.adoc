Some items stand out from the crowd. Be it a watch that is water resistant or a loudspeaker that has Bluetooth technology.
In plentymarkets, such distinguishing features are called properties and characteristics.

You can think of them as additional data fields that are not included in plentymarkets by default.
By creating properties or characteristics, you can add information to your products beyond just the standard data fields.
For example, the information that a t-shirt has a fair trade symbol.

[cols="1,4a"]

| xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Properties]
|

* Properties describe specific variations.
For example, if an item is available in red, blue or green, then the property can apply to one, two or all three of the variations.
* Properties are newer and more flexible than characteristics.

| xref:item:properties.adoc#100[Characteristics] +
(will not be developed further)
|
* Characteristics describe entire items.
For example, if an item is available in red, blue or green, then the characteristic will apply to all three variations.
* Characteristics aren’t very flexible, they’re outdated and they’re gradually being replaced by properties.

== Properties

You can think of properties as additional data fields that are not included in plentymarkets by default.
By creating properties, you can add information to your products beyond just the standard data fields.
For example, the information that a t-shirt has a fair trade symbol.

This page of the manual teaches you how to manually create properties step-by-step:

* xref:item:properties.adoc#600[Create the properties] and xref:item:properties.adoc#1200[sort them into groups].
* xref:item:properties.adoc#1400[Link the properties] to the appropriate variations.
* xref:item:properties.adoc#1500[Display the properties in your plentyShop].

[#600]
=== Creating new properties

Create the properties that you’ll use to characterise your products, e.g. Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

=== Grouping properties

There are two typical applications for property groups:

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Scenario |Explanation

| *Keeping track*
|If you have lots of properties, then you can group them together so that it’s easier to keep track of them in your plentymarkets back end.

* *_Example_*: Grouping sales channels.
Imagine you use some properties for the market Amazon and others for your plentyShop.
In this case, you could create one group called Amazon and another group called plentyShop.

| *Order properties*
|If you sell personalised items in your plentyShop, then you can use property groups to combine the offered options or services under one heading.

* *_Example_*: Grouping various trimmings.
Imagine you sell wedding rings. Your customers can choose an optional gold or diamond trim for an additional fee.
You can create a property group called “Trim” to clearly display these options.
Within this group, customers can choose the options “Gold trim” or “Diamond trim”.

=== Linking properties with variations

[#1410]
==== Where to link?

Properties are linked in a different tab depending on their type.
Open the item data record and click on the tab *Properties* or *Texts* in the lower row. Which tab depends on the property type.

==== How to link?

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.

. Click on the tab *Properties* or *Texts* in the lower row.
Which tab depends on the property type.
. Click on the *Properties* field. +
→ A drop-down list of available variation properties opens.
. Select the appropriate properties (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Click on Add (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ The properties will be added.
. If necessary, add additional information about the property.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings. +

//check this to make sure it's true
[TIP]
.Inheritance
======
By default, the main variation’s properties and values are passed down to the sub-variations.
If you want to use other properties for the sub-variations, then deactivate the inheritance function and then link the property.

Properties and values are inherited all together. You can inherit either all or none of the values.
======

[#1440]
[discrete]
===== Saving additional information

In some cases, it might be necessary to save additional information. For example:

* If the property is something like a weight or a length, then it will be necessary to enter a numeric value.
* If the property is a product description for a specific variation, then the text will need to be entered.

| *Actions*
|Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]) to delete the property link. The property itself will not be deleted. It will simply be removed from the variation.

*_Inheritance logic_*: The following logic applies when you delete a property link:
//test this to make sure it's true

* Are you removing the property from a main variation? Then the property will also be removed from all of the sub-variations that had previously inherited this property.
* Are you removing the property from a sub-variation, which has the inheritance function activated? Then the inheritance function will be deactivated. The remaining properties will no longer be inherited. Rather, they will be saved directly for the sub-variation.
//* If you delete the property link of a main variation, the link and value are deleted for all variations of the item that inherit the properties of the main variation.

.*What are order properties?*
--

//tag::faq-order-properties[]

Order properties are a special type of properties. Customers can choose them in the plentyShop and order them along with the product.

With the help of order properties, you can:

* sell personalised items in your plentyShop.
Example: Your customers should be able to upload a photo that is printed on a t-shirt.
* charge an extra fee for certain options.
Example: For an extra fee, your customers could add gold or diamond trim to a wedding ring.

.*Can I create webshop filters based on properties?*
--

//tag::faq-properties-filters[]

Yes. Imagine you’ve already:

* created properties like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
* linked the properties to the appropriate variations.
For example, the Bluetooth property was linked to your Bluetooth compliant products.

Now you can create filters.
For example, so that your customers can filter for Bluetooth compliant products in plentyShop.

== Characteristics (will not be developed further)

Some items stand out from the crowd. Be it a watch that is water resistant or a loudspeaker that has Bluetooth technology.
In plentymarkets, such distinguishing features are called characteristics.

With the help of characteristics, for example, you can:

* highlight the technical features of a product (e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).
* xref:item:frontend-item-search.adoc#[set up filters in your online store]. Your customers can then use these filters to refine the search results in the plentyShop (e.g. only see speakers that have Bluetooth technology).
* sell xref:item:personalised-items.adoc#[personalised items].

[TIP]
.Characteristics, properties and attributes: what’s the difference?
====
* xref:item:properties.adoc#100[Characteristics] describe entire items.
For example, if an item is available in red, blue or green, then the characteristic will apply to all three variations.
Characteristics aren’t very flexible, they’re outdated and they’re gradually being replaced by properties.
//Therefore, we recommend that you already start turning your characteristics into properties.
* xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Properties] describe specific variations.
For example, if an item is available in red, blue or green, then the property can apply to one, two or all three of the variations.
Therefore, properties are much more flexible.
* xref:item:attributes.adoc#[Attributes], for example, are the various colours and sizes that your products are available in.
Attributes help you simultaneously characterise your products and create saleable variations, e.g. a t-shirt in the colour red and the size S.

//lass drin, könnte hilfreich sein als Erklärung Eigenschaft vs Attribute nachdem die Merkmale wegfallen
//Characteristics and properties are passive features of an item. That means they are not linked to stock.
//Attributes, on the other hand, are used to generate saleable variations that can all have different stock levels. For example, the red variation might be sold out but the blue one is still available.
