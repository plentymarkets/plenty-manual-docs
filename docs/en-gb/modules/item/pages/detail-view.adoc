Introducing the new item UI in plentymarkets!
This page focuses on the item detail view and explains the basic concept of use.
You’ll learn how to:

* <<item/new-ui/detail-view#100, navigate through product data records>>
* <<item/new-ui/detail-view#200, customise the user interface>>
* <<item/new-ui/detail-view#1000, recognise any unsaved changes>>

[IMPORTANT]
.New item UI (closed beta)
======
This page describes the new item UI, which was released as a closed beta phase in September, 2021.

* Closed beta means that the new item UI will initially be tested by a small group of participants.
* Once the new item UI is sufficiently developed, the open beta phase will begin.
* For further information, refer to link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/neue-artikel-ui-teilnehmer-fuer-geschlossene-beta-gesucht-new-item-ui-participants-wanted-for-closed-beta/649947[this forum thread]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].
======

[#100]
== Navigation

Once you’ve opened the menu *Item » New item UI* and <<item/new-ui/search#, started a search>>, you’ll see the results in an overview.
The overview provides information about the items at a glance.
From here, you can:

* click on an item ID to open the item level.
* click somewhere else in the line to open the variation level.
* select multiple items (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and click on the pencil icon (icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"]).
This opens all of the selected item data records at once.

image::item/new-ui/assets/details-navigation.gif[]

Your items will be displayed underneath each other in the left navigation bar.

* Items are left-aligned.
* Variations are indented.
* The currently selected level is displayed in blue font.

[cols="1,4a"]
|====
|Symbol |Explanation

| icon:chevron-left[role="darkGrey"]
|Expands the item data record.

| icon:close[role="darkGrey"]
|Closes the item data record.

| icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]
|Shows and hides the navigation bar.
|====

[#200]
== Customising the user interface

When you open an item, its details are displayed in the main window on the right.
But what if the main window is empty?
Or what if you’re not happy with how the item details are arranged?
You can <<item/new-ui/detail-view#200, create a new detail view>> and customise it to meet your needs.

[#300]
=== Creating a new view

. Click on the list of views (icon:caret-down[role="darkGrey"]).
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Create new preset ...*.
. Enter a name.
. Click on *Create view*. +
→ The new view is created and opens automatically, i.e. it is applied.
It’s now possible to switch between different views.

start from Standardansicht
click "Neue Ansicht erstellen"
enter name "Meine neue Ansicht"
click on create
switch to "Demo Ansicht"
mouseover delete button
switch back to "Meine neue Ansicht"
////

[#400]
=== Creating a grid

. Click on *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]).
. Add rows and columns to create a grid.
.. Click on icon:ellipsis-v[role="blue"] and then on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Add row*.
.. Click on *Add column* (icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]).
.. Drag the columns to make them larger or smaller.

image::item/new-ui/assets/details-create-grid.gif[]

[#500]
=== Placing elements

. Add elements via drag & drop.
. Click on icon:pencil[role="blue"] and edit the element’s settings.
.. Change the name.
.. Decide which data fields the element should contain.
.. Use drag & drop to arrange the data fields in a specific order.
. Click on icon:close[role="blue"]

image::item/new-ui/assets/details-elements.gif[]

[cols="1,4a"]
|====
|Symbol |Explanation

| icon:pencil[role="blue"]
|Leads down one level.

| icon:trash[role="blue"]
|Deletes the element.

| icon:close[role="blue"]
|Leads up one level.
|====

[TIP]
.Can I add elements multiple times?
======
The number in the grey circle indicates how many times you can use the element.

* Most elements can only be added once.
* The element *Custom portlet* can be added any number of times.
However, the individual data fields within the portlet can not be added multiple times.
Further information can be found in an <<item/new-ui/detail-view#600, example of use>>.
======

[#600]
=== Custom portlets

The custom portlet differs from pre-configured portlets in two important ways.
The custom portlet:

* can be added any number of times.
* includes _all of the item data fields_ and not just a subset, as is the case with pre-configured portlets.

Thanks to custom portlets, you are not limited to the pre-defined settings.
Rather, you can decide which exact settings a portlet should include.

[discrete]
==== Example of use

Imagine you’re not satisfied with how the global settings are arranged by default.
You would rather have separate groups for the manufacturer settings and the conditions.
Such a scenario can be accomplished with custom portlets.

. Add any number of custom portlets.
. Give the portlets meaningful names.
. Add the appropriate item data fields to the portlets.

image::item/new-ui/assets/details-custom-portlets.png[]

[#700]
=== Finalising your work

. Save the view (icon:save[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"]) and close the editing mode (icon:close[role="darkGrey"]).
. Check the result in the main window.
. If necessary:
.. Click on *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]) again and edit the view even further.
.. Allow other users to see the view.

== Saving changes

[#1100]
=== Asterisk

When you make changes to an item or variation, an asterisk appears in the left navigation bar.

* The asterisk indicates unsaved changes.
* Where the asterisk appears tells you which level the changes were made on.
For example, whether a change was made on the item level or variation level.
* If you have several items open at once, then the asterisk also tells you which items were changed.
* The asterisk disappears when you save your changes or when you reset the settings to their original values.

image::item/new-ui/assets/details-asterisk.png[]

[#1200]
=== Pop-up window

If you try to close an item with unsaved changes, then a pop-up window will appear. It informs you of the unsaved changes.
The pop-up window lists which exact settings were changed.
If you changed multiple settings, then they will all be listed.

image::item/new-ui/assets/details-pop-up.png[]

[cols="1,4"]
|====
|Option |Explanation

| *Save*
|The changes will be saved and the item will close.
If you open the item again, you will see that the settings were changed.
This action is the same as the save button further up in the toolbar.
The save button is disabled as long as the changes are being saved.

| *Do not save*
|The changes will be discarded and the item will close.
If you open the item again, you will see that the settings were reset to their original state.

| *Cancel*
|Only the pop-up window will close.
The item data record remains open.
Your changes are still pending, i.e. they have not been saved yet.
You can continue editing the item.

.*Why don’t I see the menu?*

=== User interface

[.collapseBox]
.*I don't see a drop-down list with views in the upper right corner. Why not?*
--

Have you already <<item/new-ui/search#500, opened an item data record>>?
The drop-down list with views (default view and custom views) is _not visible in the overview_.
It only appears once you have opened an item data record.

image::item/new-ui/assets/default-view.png[]

--

[.collapseBox]
.*The view is empty. What am I doing wrong?*
--

Have you already <<item/new-ui/detail-view#300, created a view>>?
The view controls which product information is displayed and how this information is arranged.
In other words, you can design your item and variation pages however is most convenient for you.
If you haven’t created a view yet or if the view is empty, then you won’t see any information.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I add elements multiple times via drag & drop?*
--

The number in the grey circle indicates how many times you can use an element.

* Most elements can only be added once.
* The element *Custom portlet* can be added any number of times.
However, the individual data fields within the portlet can not be added multiple times.
Further information can be found in an <<item/new-ui/detail-view#600, example of use>>.

.*Can I import and export the views?*

Not yet.
An import/export function is planned for the future.
However, we cannot yet estimate when it will be available.

[#1600]
