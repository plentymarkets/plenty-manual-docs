This page focuses on the product’s detail view and explains the basic concept of use.
You’ll learn how to customise the product view so that it only includes the data fields that are relevant for your company.

[#200]
== Customising the product view

When you xref:item:item-search.adoc#560[open an item or variation data record in the plentysystems back end], the details are displayed in the main window on the right.
But what if you’re not happy with how the details are arranged?
You can create a new view and customise it to meet your needs.

[TIP]
.Do you have admin rights?
======
Only xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#[admin users] can create and edit views.
If you are not an admin:

. Turn to someone with admin rights.
. Ask them to xref:item:detail-view.adoc#300[create the necessary views] and xref:item:detail-view.adoc#900[assign them to your user account].
======

[#300]
=== Creating a new view

. Click on the list of views (icon:caret-down[role="darkGrey"]).
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Create new preset ...*.
. Enter a name.
. Click on *Create view*. +
→ The new view is created and opens automatically, i.e. it is applied.
It’s now possible to switch between different views.

[#400]
=== Creating a grid

. Click on *Edit view* (terra:design_inline_edit[role="darkGrey"]).
. Add rows and columns to create a grid.
.. Click on icon:ellipsis-v[role="blue"] and then on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Add row*.
.. Click on *Add column* (icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]).
.. Drag the columns to make them larger or smaller.

[#500]
=== Placing elements

. Add elements via drag & drop.
. Click on icon:pencil[role="blue"] and edit the element’s settings.
.. Change the name.
.. Decide which data fields the element should contain.
.. Use drag & drop to arrange the data fields in a specific order.
. Click on icon:close[role="blue"]

image::item:details-elements.gif[]

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Symbol |Explanation

| icon:pencil[role="blue"]
|Leads down one level.

| material:delete[role="blue"]
|Deletes the element.

| icon:close[role="blue"]
|Leads up one level.
|===

[TIP]
.Can I add elements multiple times?
======
The number in the grey circle indicates how many times you can use the element.

* Most elements can only be added once.
* The element *Custom portlet* can be added any number of times.
However, the individual data fields within the portlet can not be added multiple times.
Further information can be found in an xref:item:detail-view.adoc#600[example of use].
======

[#550]
=== Toolbar

The toolbars are customisable in the item and variation views.
In other words, you can decide which information and buttons they should include.

. Click on terra:design_inline_edit[role="darkGrey"] in the upper right corner. This opens the editing mode.
. Add the element *Toolbar* via drag & drop.
Position it at the top of the view.
. Move your cursor over the element *Toolbar* and click on icon:pencil[role="blue"] to access the settings.
. Add the buttons and information that should appear in the toolbar. +
*_Tip_*: The save button and the product information can be configured even further (icon:pencil[role="blue"]). See the table.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the view.

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Save*
|By default, when users click on the save button, a xref:item:directory.adoc#1200[pop-up window] appears, where they have to confirm their changes.
You can deactivate the pop-up window if you want the changes to be saved directly, i.e. without additional confirmation.

. Open the editing mode (terra:design_inline_edit[role="darkGrey"]) and navigate to the save button's settings (icon:pencil[role="blue"]).
. Find the setting *Show changes before saving*. +
+
icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] = Users have to confirm their changes.
+
icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] = Users do not have to confirm their changes.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the view.

| *Information*
|You can decide which information should be displayed in the toolbar.

. Open the editing mode (terra:design_inline_edit[role="darkGrey"]) and navigate to the information element's settings (icon:pencil[role="blue"]).
. Activate the information (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]) that should be displayed in the toolbar.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the view.

[#600]
=== Custom portlets

//tag::own-portlet[]
The custom portlet differs from pre-configured portlets in two important ways.
The custom portlet:

* can be added any number of times.
* includes all of the data fields and not just a subset, as is the case with pre-configured portlets.

Thanks to custom portlets, you are not limited to the pre-defined settings.
Rather, you can decide which exact settings a portlet should include.

[discrete]
==== Example of use

Imagine you’re not satisfied with how the global settings are arranged by default.
You would rather have separate groups for the manufacturer settings and the conditions.
Such a scenario can be accomplished with custom portlets.

. Add any number of custom portlets.
. Give the portlets meaningful names.
. Add the appropriate item data fields to the portlets.

//end::own-portlet[]

=== Custom texts, colours and mandatory fields

It’s possible to customise the design of an entire element or the design of a single data field.

[.collapseBox]
.*Element level*
--

You can customise the element level in the following ways:

image::item:details-level-element.gif[]

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Name*
|Gives the element a custom name.
This is useful, e.g. if you work with xref:item:detail-view.adoc#600[custom portlets] or if the pre-defined name is not specific enough.

| *Custom text*
|Adds body text or a heading to the element.

* p = Stands for paragraph.
Select this option if you want to add body text.
* h1 - h6 = Stands for heading.
Heading 1 is the largest and heading 6 is the smallest.

| *Custom note*
|Adds a colourful note to the element.

[.collapseBox]
.*Data field level*
--

You can customise the data field level in the following ways:

image::item:details-level-datafield.gif[]

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Element name*
|Gives the data field a custom name.
This is useful, e.g. if the pre-defined name is not specific enough.


| *Show hint*
|Adds a note to the data field.
The text is displayed underneath the data field and in a smaller font.

| *Required*
|Turns the data field into a mandatory field.
This means that:

* the data field is given an asterisk.
* the data field is underlined in red if it is empty.
* it will not be possible to save the data field without any content.

This is useful, e.g. if you want to require your employees to enter certain pieces of information.

| *Disabled*
|Modifies the data field so that it can no longer be edited.
This is useful, e.g. if your employees should be able to see certain pieces of information, but not edit them.

[#920]
== Special views

[#940]
=== Properties

//fast den gleichen Einleitungstext findet sich auch in die Datei verzeichnis - da bei den Eigenschaften Element

The properties element can be added any number of times.
One possible application is displaying every type of property as a separate portlet.

. Add the elements *Properties* and *Text properties* as many times as needed.
. Open the portlet's settings (icon:pencil[role="blue"]).
. Modify the settings as needed.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the view.

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Name*
|Give the portlet a meaningful name.

| *Table columns*
|Decide which information should be displayed.

| *Types*
|Decide which types of properties the portlet should include.

| *1. Language*; +
*2. Language*
|Only for text properties.
Decide which language should be displayed on the left and the right side.

|===

[#960]
=== Texts

//fast den gleichen Einleitungstext findet sich auch in die Datei verzeichnis - da bei den Text Element

By default, the text area is a bilingual view with German and English.
However, you can modify the area if you need different languages or if you want them to be displayed in a different order.
For example, you could create a monolingual view.
Or you could choose different languages and thus create a customised translation view.

. Add the element *Translations panel* as many times as needed.
. Open the portlet's settings (icon:pencil[role="blue"]).
. Click on icon:gear[role="darkGrey"] *Configure languages*.
. Which languages should be displayed together?
Select one or more languages (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Which language should be displayed first, second, third, etc?
.. Move your cursor over a language with the symbol material:drag_indicator[role="darkGrey"]. +
→ Your cursor changes its shape (icon:arrows[role="darkGrey"]).
.. Drag the language to the appropriate position.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the view.

TIP: Imagine your product texts are translated from English into German, French, Spanish and Italian.
The view would be very cluttered if you displayed all of the languages together.
Instead, only select the first language pair, e.g. English and German.
Then add the translation panel a second time and select the next language pair, e.g. English and French.
Repeat the process as many times as necessary.
The translation panels are displayed one underneath the other. They can be expanded or collapsed as needed (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]).
