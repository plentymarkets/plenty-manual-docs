Your business is booming and you’ve already built a solid product portfolio.
But how do you best deal with item data in your day-to-day work?
plentymarkets includes several functions for processing items.
<<table-batch-processing-item-filter>> compares the possibilities and uses examples to illustrate them.

.Functions for processing items
[[table-batch-processing-item-filter]]

| Function | Explanation

|<<item/import-export-create/create/mass-processing#100, Group function>>
a|*_Examples_*:

* you want to choose the items that should be included in a special sale.
* you want to choose the items whose prices should be increased.

*_Technical specifications_*:

* edits several items or variations at once.
* you directly choose the items or variations that should be edited.

|<<item/import-export-create/create/mass-processing#400, Batch processing>>
a|*_Examples_*:

* you want to increase the price of all the items that are manufactured by a certain company.

*_Technical specifications_*:

* you use filters to limit which items or variations should be edited.

|<<item/import-export-create/create/mass-processing#650, Import & Export>>
|Use the import & export, e.g. if you want to modify several items and variations at once.
Export a CSV file containing product data.
Then revise the file and import it again.

|<<item/import-export-create/create/mass-processing#700, Search & replace>>
|Imagine you just found out that your manufacturer renamed a part.
Now it’s your job to change the name in all of your item texts.
Use the search & replace function to globally change a word or phrase in all of your item texts.

|<<item/import-export-create/create/mass-processing#800, Copy>>
|Imagine you want to add a new item to your product portfolio.
It’s really similar to an existing product.
In this case, copy the existing product.
Then change the settings that differ for the new item.
|====

[#100]
== Group function

Use the group function to _edit several items or variations at once_.
You’ll directly choose the items or variations that should be edited.
For example, you can use the group function to:

* choose the items that should be included in a special sale.
* choose the items whose prices should be increased.

===== Inheritance

Changes the <<item/introduction/inheritance#, inheritance behaviour>> for prices, availability levels, categories, etc.
In other words, specifies whether the data should be passed down from the main variation to whichever sub-variations were chosen in the item overview.

[cols="1,4"]
|====
| Check mark on the right | Explanation

|icon:check-square[role="blue"]
|The data (prices, availabilities, categories, etc.) will be passed down from the main variation to whichever sub-variations were chosen in the item overview.
Data that was previously saved for the variation will be overwritten.

|icon:square-o[role="darkGrey"]
|Deactivates the inheritance function.
The main variation’s data will be saved for the sub-variation.
|====

*_Note_*: This group function controls the inheritance of all prices, categories, suppliers etc. saved for the main variation.
It is not possible for individual prices, categories, suppliers, etc. to be inherited.

--

[#400]
== Batch processing

Use batch processing to _edit several items or variations at once_.
You’ll set filters to limit which items or variations should be edited.
For example, you can use batch processing to:

* put all of the items in a particular category on sale.
* increase the price of all the items that are manufactured by a certain company.

[IMPORTANT]
.Batch processing crashes with large quantities
====
There may be a timeout if you try to edit too many items or variations at once.
If you need to edit large quantities, then we recommend that you:

* use the <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#, import tool>> instead.
* divide the batch processing job in smaller parts.
For example, you could work with flags and only edit a sub-set of your items or variations at once.

Imagine you just found out that your manufacturer renamed a part.
Now it’s your job to change the name in all of your item texts.

Use the search & replace function to globally change a word or phrase in all of your item texts.
In other words, search for a specific item text in the database and replace the results with a new text.

[.instruction]
Copying an item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. <<item/introduction/search#100, Search for>> and open the item.
. Click on *Copy* (icon:copy[set=plenty, role="yellow"]) in the upper toolbar. +
