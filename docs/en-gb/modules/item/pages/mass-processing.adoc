Your business is booming and you’ve already built a solid product portfolio.
But how do you best deal with item data in your day-to-day work?
plentymarkets includes several functions for processing items.
The table compares the possibilities and uses examples to illustrate them.

//tag::mass-editing-preamble[]

[cols="1,5"]
|====
| Function | Explanation

|xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#100[Group function]
a|*_Examples_*:

* you want to choose the items that should be included in a special sale.
* you want to choose the items whose prices should be increased.

*_Technical specifications_*:

* edits several items or variations at once.
* you directly choose the items or variations that should be edited.

|xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#400[Batch processing]
a|*_Examples_*:

* you want all of the items in a particular category to be included in a special sale.
* you want to increase the price of all the items that are manufactured by a certain company.

*_Technical specifications_*:

* edits several items or variations at once.
* you use filters to limit which items or variations should be edited.

|xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#650[Import & Export]
|Use the import & export, e.g. if you want to modify several items and variations at once.
Export a CSV file containing product data.
Then revise the file and import it again.

|xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#700[Search & replace]
|Imagine you just found out that your manufacturer renamed a part.
Now it’s your job to change the name in all of your item texts.
Use the search & replace function to globally change a word or phrase in all of your item texts.

|xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#800[Copy]
|Imagine you want to add a new item to your product portfolio.
It’s really similar to an existing product.
In this case, copy the existing product.
Then change the settings that differ for the new item.

//end::mass-editing-preamble[]

[#100]
== Group function

Use the group function to edit several items or variations at once.
You’ll directly choose the items or variations that should be edited.
For example, you can use the group function to:

* choose the items that should be included in a special sale.
* choose the items whose prices should be increased.

===== Inheritance

Changes the xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inheritance behaviour] for prices, availability levels, categories, etc.
In other words, specifies whether the data should be passed down from the main variation to whichever sub-variations were chosen in the item overview.

[cols="1,4"]
|====
| Check mark on the right | Explanation

|icon:check-square[role="blue"]
|The data (prices, availabilities, categories, etc.) will be passed down from the main variation to whichever sub-variations were chosen in the item overview.
Data that was previously saved for the variation will be overwritten.

|icon:square-o[role="darkGrey"]
|Deactivates the inheritance function.
The main variation’s data will be saved for the sub-variation.
|====

*_Note_*: This group function controls the inheritance of all prices, categories, suppliers etc. saved for the main variation.
It is not possible for individual prices, categories, suppliers, etc. to be inherited.

--

[#400]
== Batch processing

Use batch processing to edit several items or variations at once.
You’ll set filters to limit which items or variations should be edited.
For example, you can use batch processing to:

* put all of the items in a particular category on sale.
* increase the price of all the items that are manufactured by a certain company.

[IMPORTANT]
.Batch processing crashes with large quantities
====

//tag::batchprocessing-timeout[]

There may be a timeout if you try to edit too many items or variations at once.
If you need to edit large quantities, then we recommend that you:

* use the xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool] instead.
* divide the batch processing job in smaller parts.
For example, you could work with flags and only edit a sub-set of your items or variations at once.

//end::batchprocessing-timeout[]

Imagine you just found out that your manufacturer renamed a part.
Now it’s your job to change the name in all of your item texts.

Use the search & replace function to globally change a word or phrase in all of your item texts.
In other words, search for a specific item text in the database and replace the results with a new text.

[.instruction]
Searching and replacing item texts:

//tag::search-replace-config[]

. Go to *Item » Search & replace*.
. Select the database field.
. Enter a search term into the first field. The field is case-sensitive.
. Enter a new text into the second field.
. Click on *Search*. +
→ The number of relevant items is displayed.
. Click on *Replace all*. +
→ All texts are replaced by the new texts.

//end::search-replace-config[]

[#800]
== Copying items and variations

Imagine you want to add a new item to your product portfolio.
It’s really similar to an existing product.
In this case, copy the existing product.
Then change the settings that differ for the new item.

[.instruction]
Copying an item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#100[Search for] and open the item.
. Click on *Copy* (terra:copy[role="yellow"]) in the upper toolbar. +

[discrete]
===== What exactly is copied?

A copy of the item and its variations is created.

For example, carefully check the xref:item:managing-items.adoc#240[sales prices], xref:item:managing-items.adoc#250[barcodes] and xref:item:managing-items.adoc#200[availabilities] and edit them as needed.
