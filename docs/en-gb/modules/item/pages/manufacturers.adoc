Who makes your products?
Which brands do you sell?
plentymarkets helps you manage your manufacturer data.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

* First, xref:item:manufacturers.adoc#100[create the necessary manufacturer data records] manually or via import.
* Then add xref:item:manufacturers.adoc#300[commission models] as needed.
* Finally, specify who manufactured each of your items. This is done by xref:item:manufacturers.adoc#400[linking your items to manufacturers].
* Should your customers be able to search in the plentyShop for products made by a specific manufacturer?
Customise the xref:item:manufacturers.adoc#450[plentyShop settings] as needed.

== Creating manufacturer data records

[tabs]
====
Manual creation::
+
--
. Go to *Setup » Item » Manufacturers*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New*. +
→ The *New manufacturer* tab opens.
. Enter the manufacturer data.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The manufacturer is added.

--
Data import::
+
--
plentymarkets has an xref:data:ElasticSync.adoc#[import tool].
The idea is simple. Rather than manually saving manufacturer information in plentymarkets, you’ll xref:data:elasticSync-manufacturer.adoc#[enter the same information into a CSV file] and then import this file into your system.

====

[TIP]
.Can I save my manufacturer data in the CRM menu instead?
====
Maybe you noticed that it’s possible to xref:crm:create-contact.adoc#create-contact[create manufacturer data records in the CRM menu].
But be careful.
This data is not transferred over to the menu *Setup » Item » Manufacturers*.
Therefore, we recommend that you ignore the manufacturer data in the CRM menu for now.

→ A new line for commissions is added to the table.

| *Commission*

== Linking manufacturers to items

Once you’ve saved your manufacturer data in plentymarkets, you’ll specify who manufactured each individual item. This is done by linking each item with a manufacturer.

There are several different ways to link items to manufacturers:

* Specify the manufacturer xref:item:new-item.adoc#200[while you manually create a new item].
* Specify the manufacturer xref:item:managing-items#40[in an existing item’s Global tab].
* xref:item:mass-processing.adoc#100[Use the group function] to manually specify the manufacturer for several existing items at once.
* Do you want to import your items? Then xref:data:elasticSync-item#2260[specify each item’s manufacturer in the CSV file] that you will import.

[#450]
== Checking the plentyShop settings

Should your customers be able to search in the plentyShop for products made by a specific manufacturer?
Then make sure that you’ve configured the following settings:

* xref:item:manufacturers.adoc#100[External name]: Have you saved an external name for the manufacturer?
* xref:item:search-bar.adoc#70[Search bar]: Are manufacturers included in the search results?
* xref:item:frontend-item-search.adoc#[Search filters]: Have you read the instructions on setting up the so-called faceted search?

[#500]

→ The manufacturers can now be deleted.
