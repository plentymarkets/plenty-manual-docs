Every time you <<item/import-export-create/create/new-item#, create a new item or variation>>, it automatically receives a variation number.
You can decide which pattern should be used to assign new variation numbers.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Settings*.
. Configure the settings *Prefix for new variation numbers* and *Last generated variation number*. Note <<table-variation-number-pattern>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Prefix for new variation numbers*
|Enter a prefix that should be added to the beginning of the number when new variation numbers are generated. If the field is empty, the prefix *NEW-* is used.

| *Last generated variation number*
|Shows the variation number that was last assigned to a variation. New variation numbers that are generated afterwards will be given ascending numbers starting from this point. The variation number that is displayed here will be updated as soon as a new variation number was generated. In other words, you will always see the number that was assigned for the last variation. Enter a different number to change the pattern for new variation numbers. The next number assigned is this number plus 1.
