Templates help you create listings faster:

* The templates include your regularly used listing settings.
* If you select a listing template here, then its settings will be pre-selected in the next steps.
* You save time because you don't have to choose every setting separately.

*_Note_*: This drop-down list only includes the xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#5500[listing templates that you've already created].

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Step: Settings*
--

* *Type* = What type of listing do you want to create? Select the type from the drop-down list.
* *Number per lot* = Enter the item quantity that should be offered in the listing. The listing price applies to the entire quantity.
* *Stock dependence* =
Should your listing only be visible if there is sufficient stock?
xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#3400[Further information about the setting].
** *_Note_*: Also pay attention to the xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#1100[automatic stock update function in the initial settings], as it correlates to this setting.
* *Transfer as item number* = Which information should be transmitted to eBay, ricardo or Hood as the item number?
* *Contents* = The drop-down list contains the combinations of content and unit that are available for the individual variations.
Select whichever combination of content and unit should be used for the entire listing.
The combination of content and unit from the main variation is pre-selected.
* *Tie to item price* = Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if you want to tie the listing's price to the price of the item in plentysystems.
** Listing type fixed price: When the price changes in plentysystems, it is not automatically changed on the market. You have to update the price manually or carry out a stock synchronisation. The price on the market can also change after the stock is synchronised if the exchange rate changed.
** Listing type auction: The item price is used as the price for the "buy it now" option.

=== Stock

Here you see an overview of the item’s stock.
In other words, you’ll see how many copies of each variation are in stock.
Click on the three dots (icon:ellipsis-v[role="darkGrey"]) to correct the stock level or redistribute the stock.

//bild

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Variation ID*; +
*Variation name*; +
*Variation number*; +
*Barcode*; +
*Attributes*
|The overview indicates how many copies of each variation are in stock.
The variation ID, name, number, barcode and attributes tell you which variation the stock information applies to.

| *Warehouse*; +
*Availability*; +
*Bundle*
|Here you see general information about the variation.
You can see which xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#[warehouse] the item is stored in, which xref:item:availability.adoc#[availability level] it has and whether it is an xref:item:combining-products.adoc#[item bundle].

| *Purchase price*
|The variation’s purchase price.

*_Note_*:
In the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Search*, you can decide whether the average purchase price should be displayed here or the purchase price that is currently saved in the variation data record.

//Note that the purchase price saved in the variation data record can also be the average purchase price.
//This depends on which purchase price was saved while receiving the goods.
//In the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items*, you can decide how data should be saved while receiving goods.

| *Value of goods*
|The value is calculated by multiplying the purchase price with the physical stock.

*_Example_*:

* Purchase price = 20 EUR
* Physical stock = 100 copies
* Value of items = 20 x 100 = 2,000 EUR

| *Physical stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are physically in the warehouse.

| *Reserved stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently reserved.

* Stock is reserved when there is a pending order or a warranty.
* The stock stays reserved until the outgoing items are booked or until the order / warranty is cancelled.
* The reserved stock is part of the physical stock because the reserved stock is still present in the warehouse.

| *Reserved stock for listings*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently in an auction on eBay, ricardo or Hood and thus reserved.

*_Background info_*:
In legal terms, listings are binding offers to potential customers. Therefore, it makes sense to be careful and to reserve those items offered in listings, even before they have a concrete order.
Otherwise you might sell more variations than you have in stock.

You can decide whether or not you want items from active listings to be registered as reserved stock in plentysystems.

. When you create a market listing, select *limited (with reservation)* for the *stock dependence*. This will reserve the listed quantity.
. As soon as a listing was successfully completed, the setting is no longer active.
However, the sold item is now reserved within the order.

| *Reserved stock for bundles*
|Indicates how many item bundles are currently included in pending orders and thus reserved. The quantity of a variation that is reserved by an item bundle is also included in the quantity displayed in the Reserved stock column.

//zukunft - die beschreibung hier etwas klarer schreiben

| *Reorder level*
|You can think of this value as a target value.
In other words, how many copies of the item should ideally be in the warehouse.

| *Reorder level Δ*
|The difference to the reorder level.
This value indicates how many copies need to be sold or reordered before you will get back to the reorder level.

*_Example 1_*:

* Reorder level = 30 copies
* Physical stock = 10 copies
* Reorder level Δ = 20 copies

In this example, we want to have 30 copies of the item.
Currently, there are only 10 copies in the warehouse.
Therefore, we need to reorder 20 copies to get back to the target value.

---

*_Example 2_*:

* Reorder level = 10 copies
* Physical stock = 40 copies
* Reorder level Δ = -30 copies

In this example, we want to have 10 copies of the item.
Currently, there are only 40 copies in the warehouse.
Therefore, we still need to sell 30 copies to get back to the target value.

| *Net stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently available for sale.
The net stock is a subset of the physical stock.
Substract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.

| *Supply*
|Here you see how many copies of the item are on their way to the warehouse.
This replenishment value indicates how many units are currently being delivered to your warehouse.

//zukunft - rausfinden, ob die Info unten auch für die neue Artikel-UI zutrifft

//Quantity of reordered items. Click on the quantity to open the menu Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order. You will automatically see which reorders the variation is included in.

=== Images

//tag::images[]
Here you see a preview of all the images for this item.
If necessary, you can upload additional images, save information about the images or delete specific images.

[TIP]
.Example workflow
====
Imagine you sell a t-shirt in the colours red, green and blue.
You want customers e.g. to automatically see an image of the green t-shirt when they select the colour green in your plentyShop.
To do so:

. Upload all of the product images (i.e. images of the red, green and blue t-shirt variations).
. Save details about the individual images.
. Assign the images to the appropriate variations.
For example, assign the green t-shirt image to the green t-shirt variation.

| *File formats*
|The file formats supported for images are: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG

| *File names*
a|Image file names may contain the following characters:

* Letters (a-z, A-Z) excluding umlauts
* Numbers (0-9)
* Underscores (_)
* Hyphens (-)

Spaces and special characters such as umlauts are not permitted. When you upload images, spaces and special characters are replaced by hyphens (-).

| *Image sizes*
a|Every time an item image is uploaded, plentysystems creates the following versions:

* High-resolution item image
* Medium-sized item image
* Item attribute image
* Two preview images

Since plentysystems does not scale up images, the source image must have at least the size and quality specified in the xref:item:images.adoc#500[Sizes] area. Larger images will be scaled down to the specified size.

| *Original images*
|Original images are no longer accessible after they have been uploaded.
When you upload an image, plentysystems uses it to generate the image sizes that are accessible via URL.
The original image will no longer be accessible - also not via URL.

.*Practical example: creating a single-language or multi-language view*
--

By default, this is a bilingual view with German and English.
But while you xref:item:detail-view.adoc#[customise the view], you can decide which languages you need and which order they should be displayed in.
For example, you could create a monolingual view.
Or you could choose different languages and thus create a customised translation view.

//tag::texts-multilingual-panel[]

. Add the element *Translations panel* as many times as needed.
. Open the portlet's settings (icon:pencil[role="blue"]).
. Click on icon:gear[role="darkGrey"] *Configure languages*.
. Which languages should be displayed together?
Select one or more languages (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Which language should be displayed first, second, third, etc?
.. Move your cursor over a language with the symbol material:drag_indicator[role="darkGrey"]. +
→ Your mouse cursor changes shape (icon:arrows[role="darkGrey"]).
.. Drag the language to the appropriate position.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the view.

TIP: Imagine your product texts are translated from English into German, French, Spanish and Italian.
The view would be very cluttered if you displayed all of the languages together.
Instead, only select the first language pair, e.g. English and German.
Then add the translation panel a second time and select the next language pair, e.g. English and French.
Repeat the process as many times as necessary.
The translation panels are displayed one underneath the other. They can be expanded or collapsed as needed (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]).

[TIP]
.Vererbungslogik
======
Properties and values can be passed down from the main variation to the sub-variations, i.e. they can be inherited.

* If you want to use other properties for the sub-variations, then deactivate the inheritance function and then link the property.
* Properties and values are inherited all together. In other words, you can either have all or none of the values be inherited.
======

//check this to make sure it's true
[TIP]
.Deleting the links again
======
Click on material:delete[role="darkGrey"] *Delete link* to delete the property link. The property itself will not be deleted. It will simply be removed from the variation.

*_Inheritance logic_*: The following logic applies when you delete a property link:

* Are you removing the property from a main variation? Then the property will also be removed from all of the sub-variations that had previously inherited this property.
* Are you removing the property from a sub-variation, which has the inheritance function activated? Then the inheritance function will be deactivated. The remaining properties will no longer be inherited. Rather, they will be saved directly for the sub-variation.

[#290]
=== Client (store)

plentysystems is a multitenant application.
In other words, you can manage several different areas of business with just one system.

*_Example_*: Imagine you sell medications.
To better reach your target groups, you've split your product line among two webshops.
One shop specialises in natural products and alternative medicine.
The other shop sells traditional medicine.
Your webshops have different names and designs, and your end customers don't know that they are actually the same company.
Nonetheless, you can use just one system to fulfil all of your orders and manage both business divisions.

[.instruction]
Linking a client to the variation:

//tag::link-client[]
. Go to *Item » Items » [Open variation] » Element: Client (store)*.
. Choose whichever store (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]) the variation should appear in.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.
//end::link-client[]

[TIP]
.Setting has a blue info-box? Check the stock level!
====
plentysystems can automatically remove items from the plentyShop if they are no longer in stock.
This automatic function is controlled by the settings in the menu xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Items » [Open variation] » Element: Availability and visibility].
More specifically, it’s controlled by the settings *Client automatic availability: Not deliverable if net stock is negative* and *Client automatic visibility: Not visible if net stock is negative*.

If one of these options is activated and the variation is no longer in stock, then a blue info-box will appear here.
Reorder the variation to get it back in stock.
Alternatively, click on *Temporarily make available* if you want to manually make the variation visible in the plentyShop despite the fact that it’s not in stock.

This setting remains valid until new stock is booked for the variation. Once net stock for the variation becomes positive, the availability and visibility settings if net stock is 0 or negative take effect again.

=== Warehouse

//zukunft - sobald die neue artikel-ui die haupt-ui ist, kann diesen Kapitel als ein include Datei mit Tags gemacht werden, die auch auf die Seite waren:variations-track-stock.adoc ausgegeben wird

Where is the variation stored?
Assign your variations to the appropriate storage locations.
This is useful so that you can:

* xref:stock-management:new-incoming-items.adoc#450[correctly receive incoming goods].
* xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#[reorder goods when you start to run out].

[TIP]
.Have you already saved warehouse information?
====
Before you can link variations to storage locations, you’ll need to tell plentysystems a little bit about your warehouse.
How many zones, racks, shelves and storage locations are there in your warehouse?
xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#[Set up your warehouse] before you continue.
====

[.instruction]
Adding a warehouse:

. Go to *Item » Items » [Open variation] » Element: Warehouse*.
. Click on *Add warehouse* (icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]). +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. Select the warehouse that you want to link.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The data will be displayed as a table.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Warehouse*
|Here you see the warehouse that was selected.
This is purely informative and cannot be changed.

| *Storage location type*
|Select the storage location type according to the size of the variation.

//this doesn't make sense - in the ui you can choose 1-20 : it doesn't match the warehouse dimensions saved
| *Zone*
|Select a zone if you have set up zones for this warehouse.

| *Reorder level*
|Enter the quantity at which the variation should be reordered.
If the variation’s stock level sinks down to this reorder level, then plentysystems will automatically suggest that you reorder it. This means that the variation is only reordered once it has reached the reorder level.

*_Note_*: If the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#reorder-value_variation_warehouse[difference between the current stock level and the reorder level] is calculated dynamically, then you can only save the value `0` here.

| *Maximum stock*
|Enter the maximum stock level for the warehouse.
plentysystems takes the maximum stock level into consideration when suggesting how many copies of an item should be reordered. The suggested reorder quantity will not exceed the maximum stock level entered here.

| *Stock turnover (in days)*
|Enter the number of days that the stock should suffice until the next reorder.
This value is relevant for calculating the reorder quantity.

*_Note_*:
If no value is entered here, then the stock turnover (in days) is not taken into consideration when calculating a reorder date.

*_Practical example_*:
A standard value that could be used for the stock turnover is 14 days.
Once the item has reached the reorder level, the 14 days will be used to calculate how many copies of the item need to be reordered. In other words, the suggested reorder quantity would be sufficient for the following 14 days.

| *Stock buffer*
|Enter a stock buffer.
This causes the stock to be reduced by this value for certain markets.

*_Note_*:
The values entered here are only used for the markets xref:markets:amazon-setup.adoc#[Amazon] and xref:markets:shopgate.adoc#[Shopgate].
The buffer entered here takes priority over the buffer values entered for the particular market.
For markets which are not listed here, the stock buffer settings of the specific market take priority over this setting.

*_Example_*: There are 50 copies of an item in stock.
You want to keep 10 copies of the item as a buffer, so that the item cannot be sold out completely on the market.
This is done by entering 10 as the stock buffer.
As a result, 40 copies of the item are transmitted to the marketplace.

| *Batch*
|Select this option if the batch number should be saved for this variation and warehouse.

*_Note_*: Once stock has been booked into the warehouse, you will no longer be able to deactivate this option.
If the stock level for the warehouse is 0, then it will be possible to activate or deactivate the option.

| *BBD*
|Select this option if the best before date should be saved for this variation and warehouse.

*_Note_*: Once stock has been booked into the warehouse, you will no longer be able to deactivate this option.
If the stock level for the warehouse is 0, then it will be possible to activate or deactivate the option.

| *Suggested storage location*
|Select a storage location that should automatically be suggested when the variation is reordered.

*_Note_*: The standard storage location serves as a placeholder. It means that you haven’t chosen a specific storage location yet.

=== Stock

Here you see an overview of the stock.
In other words, you’ll see how many copies of each variation are in stock.
Click on the three dots (icon:ellipsis-v[role="darkGrey"]) to correct the stock level or redistribute the stock.

//zukunft - die beschreibungen in dieser tabelle (und der Tabelle unter Artikel-Ebene > Bestand) mit den Beschreibungen unter warenwirtschaft:warenbestaende-verwalten.adoc#400 angleichen - dafür includes verwenden

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Variation name*; +
*Variation number*; +
*Barcode*; +
*Attributes*
|The overview indicates how many copies of each variation are in stock.
The variation ID, name, number, barcode and attributes tell you which variation the stock information applies to.

| *Warehouse*; +
*Availability*; +
*Bundle*
|Here you see general information about the variation.
You can see which xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#[warehouse] the item is stored in, which xref:item:availability.adoc#[availability level] it has and whether it is an xref:item:combining-products.adoc#[item bundle].

| *Purchase price*
|The variation’s purchase price.

*_Note_*:
In the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Search*, you can decide whether the average purchase price should be displayed here or the purchase price that is currently saved in the variation data record.

//Note that the purchase price saved in the variation data record can also be the average purchase price.
//This depends on which purchase price was saved while receiving the goods.
//In the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items*, you can decide how data should be saved while receiving goods.

| *Value of goods*
|The value is calculated by multiplying the purchase price with the physical stock.

*_Example_*:

* Purchase price = 20 EUR
* Physical stock = 100 copies
* Value of items = 20 x 100 = 2,000 EUR

| *Physical stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are physically in the warehouse.

| *Reserved stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently reserved.

* Stock is reserved when there is a pending order or a warranty.
* The stock stays reserved until the outgoing items are booked or until the order / warranty is cancelled.
* The reserved stock is part of the physical stock because the reserved stock is still present in the warehouse.

| *Reserved stock for listings*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently in an auction on eBay, ricardo or Hood and thus reserved.

*_Background info_*:
In legal terms, listings are binding offers to potential customers. Therefore, it makes sense to be careful and to reserve those items offered in listings, even before they have a concrete order.
Otherwise you might sell more variations than you have in stock.

You can decide whether or not you want items from active listings to be registered as reserved stock in plentysystems.

. When you create a market listing, select *limited (with reservation)* for the *stock dependence*. This will reserve the listed quantity.
. As soon as a listing was successfully completed, the setting is no longer active.
However, the sold item is now reserved within the order.

| *Reserved stock for bundles*
|Indicates how many item bundles are currently included in pending orders and thus reserved. The quantity of a variation that is reserved by an item bundle is also included in the quantity displayed in the Reserved stock column.

//zukunft - die beschreibung hier etwas klarer schreiben

| *Reorder level*
|You can think of this value as a target value.
In other words, how many copies of the item should ideally be in the warehouse.

| *Reorder level Δ*
|The difference to the reorder level.
This value indicates how many copies need to be sold or reordered before you will get back to the reorder level.

*_Example 1_*:

* Reorder level = 30 copies
* Physical stock = 10 copies
* Reorder level Δ = 20 copies

In this example, we want to have 30 copies of the item.
Currently, there are only 10 copies in the warehouse.
Therefore, we need to reorder 20 copies to get back to the target value.

---

*_Example 2_*:

* Reorder level = 10 copies
* Physical stock = 40 copies
* Reorder level Δ = -30 copies

In this example, we want to have 10 copies of the item.
Currently, there are only 40 copies in the warehouse.
Therefore, we still need to sell 30 copies to get back to the target value.

| *Net stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently available for sale.
The net stock is a subset of the physical stock.
Substract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.

| *Supply*
|Here you see how many copies of the item are on their way to the warehouse.
This replenishment value indicates how many units are currently being delivered to your warehouse.

Access rights are defined separately for each role.
For example, you can only grant the content department access to the item data.

[discrete]
===== Step 1: Which rights should the role have?

. An administrator opens the menu *Setup » Account management » Roles*.
. Then he opens the role, e.g. content employee, or he creates a new role.
. *Rights*: The administrator activates the necessary rights (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
* *_Tip_*: Which exact rights need to be activated depends on what exactly the employee should do.
* *_Tip_*: Before you grant employees rights across the board, test the configuration in a user account without admin rights.
. *Role-defined views*: The administrator expands the entries (icon:chevron-right[role="darkGrey"]) and selects the xref:item:detail-view.adoc#300[views] (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that the user should have access to.
. The administrator saves the role (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]).
