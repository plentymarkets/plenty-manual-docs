=== Stock

Here you see an overview of the item’s stock.
In other words, you’ll see how many copies of each variation are in stock.
Click on the three dots (icon:ellipsis-v[role="darkGrey"]) to correct the stock level or redistribute the stock.

//bild

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Variation ID*; +
*Variation name*; +
*Variation number*; +
*Barcode*; +
*Attributes*
|The overview indicates how many copies of each variation are in stock.
The variation ID, name, number, barcode and attributes tell you which variation the stock information applies to.

| *Warehouse*; +
*Availability*; +
*Bundle*
|Here you see general information about the variation.
You can see which xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#[warehouse] the item is stored in, which xref:item:availability.adoc#[availability level] it has and whether it is an xref:item:combining-products.adoc#[item bundle].

| *Purchase price*
|The variation’s purchase price.

*_Note_*:
In the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Search*, you can decide whether the average purchase price should be displayed here or the purchase price that is currently saved in the variation data record.

//Note that the purchase price saved in the variation data record can also be the average purchase price.
//This depends on which purchase price was saved while receiving the goods.
//In the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items*, you can decide how data should be saved while receiving goods.

| *Value of goods*
|The value is calculated by multiplying the purchase price with the physical stock.

*_Example_*:

* Purchase price = 20 EUR
* Physical stock = 100 copies
* Value of items = 20 x 100 = 2,000 EUR

| *Physical stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are physically in the warehouse.

| *Reserved stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently reserved.

* Stock is reserved when there is a pending order or a warranty.
* The stock stays reserved until the outgoing items are booked or until the order / warranty is cancelled.
* The reserved stock is part of the physical stock because the reserved stock is still present in the warehouse.

| *Reserved stock for listings*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently in an auction on eBay, ricardo or Hood and thus reserved.

*_Background info_*:
In legal terms, listings are binding offers to potential customers. Therefore, it makes sense to be careful and to reserve those items offered in listings, even before they have a concrete order.
Otherwise you might sell more variations than you have in stock.

You can decide whether or not you want items from active listings to be registered as reserved stock in plentymarkets.

. When you create a market listing, select *limited (with reservation)* for the *stock dependence*. This will reserve the listed quantity.
. As soon as a listing was successfully completed, the setting is no longer active.
However, the sold item is now reserved within the order.

| *Reserved stock for bundles*
|Indicates how many item bundles are currently included in pending orders and thus reserved. The quantity of a variation that is reserved by an item bundle is also included in the quantity displayed in the Reserved stock column.

//zukunft - die beschreibung hier etwas klarer schreiben

| *Reorder level*
|You can think of this value as a target value.
In other words, how many copies of the item should ideally be in the warehouse.

| *Reorder level Δ*
|The difference to the reorder level.
This value indicates how many copies need to be sold or reordered before you will get back to the reorder level.

*_Example 1_*:

* Reorder level = 30 copies
* Physical stock = 10 copies
* Reorder level Δ = 20 copies

In this example, we want to have 30 copies of the item.
Currently, there are only 10 copies in the warehouse.
Therefore, we need to reorder 20 copies to get back to the target value.

---

*_Example 2_*:

* Reorder level = 10 copies
* Physical stock = 40 copies
* Reorder level Δ = -30 copies

In this example, we want to have 10 copies of the item.
Currently, there are only 40 copies in the warehouse.
Therefore, we still need to sell 30 copies to get back to the target value.

| *Net stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently available for sale.
The net stock is a subset of the physical stock.
Substract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.

| *Supply*
|Here you see how many copies of the item are on their way to the warehouse.
This replenishment value indicates how many units are currently being delivered to your warehouse.

//zukunft - rausfinden, ob die Info unten auch für die neue Artikel-UI zutrifft

//Quantity of reordered items. Click on the quantity to open the menu Stock » Reorder management » Purchase order. You will automatically see which reorders the variation is included in.
//Note: Even if you have not yet submitted a reorder to your supplier, the quantity included in the reorder will already be added to the quantity that is in supply.

=== Images

//tag::images[]
Here you see a preview of all the images for this item.
If necessary, you can upload additional images, save information about the images or delete specific images.

[TIP]
.Example workflow
====
Imagine you sell a t-shirt in the colours red, green and blue.
You want customers e.g. to automatically see an image of the green t-shirt when they select the colour green in your plentyShop.
To do so:

. Upload all of the product images (i.e. images of the red, green and blue t-shirt variations).
. Save details about the individual images.
. Assign the images to the appropriate variations.
For example, assign the green t-shirt image to the green t-shirt variation.

| *File formats*
|The file formats supported for images are: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG

| *File names*
a|Image file names may contain the following characters:

* Letters (a-z, A-Z) excluding umlauts
* Numbers (0-9)
* Underscores (_)
* Hyphens (-)

Spaces and special characters such as umlauts are not permitted. When you upload images, spaces and special characters are replaced by hyphens (-).

| *Image sizes*
a|Every time an item image is uploaded, plentymarkets creates the following versions:

* High-resolution item image
* Medium-sized item image
* Item attribute image
* Two preview images

Since plentymarkets does not scale up images, the source image must have at least the size and quality specified in the xref:item:images.adoc#500[Sizes] area. Larger images will be scaled down to the specified size.

| *Original images*
|Original images are no longer accessible after they have been uploaded.
When you upload an image, plentymarkets uses it to generate the image sizes that are accessible via URL.
The original image will no longer be accessible - also not via URL.

|Which language do you want to write the texts in?
Select languages from the drop-down lists on the left and right.

*_Note_*: By default, this is a bilingual view with German and English.
But you can customise the view and specify which languages you need, i.e. choose different languages or create a single-language view.

.*Practical example: creating a single-language or multi-language view*
--

By default, this is a bilingual view with German and English.
But while you xref:item:detail-view.adoc#[customise the view], you can decide which languages you need and which order they should be displayed in.
For example, you could create a monolingual view.
Or you could choose different languages and thus create a customised translation view.

//tag::texts-multilingual-panel[]

. Add the element *Translations panel* as many times as needed.
. Open the portlet’s settings (icon:pencil[role="blue"]).
. Click on icon:gear[role="darkGrey"] *Configure languages*.
. Which languages should be displayed together?
Select one or more languages (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Which language should be displayed first, second, third, etc?
.. Move your cursor over a language with the symbol material:drag_indicator[role="darkGrey"]. +
→ Your mouse cursor changes shape (icon:arrows[role="darkGrey"]).
.. Drag the language to the appropriate position.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the view.



TIP: Imagine your product texts are translated from English into German, French, Spanish and Italian.
The view would be very cluttered if you displayed all of the languages together.
Instead, only select the first language pair, e.g. English and German.
Then add the translation panel a second time and select the next language pair, e.g. English and French.
Repeat the process as many times as necessary.
The translation panels are displayed one underneath the other. They can be expanded or collapsed as needed (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]).

Here you see the item’s cross-selling links.
If necessary, you can link the item to any number of other products from your portfolio.

One possible application is displaying every type of property as a separate portlet.

//tag::properties-type-portlet[]

. Add the elements *Properties* and *Text properties* as many times as needed.
. Open the portlet’s settings (icon:pencil[role="blue"]).
. Customise the settings as needed.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the view.



[cols="1,4a"]

|Setting |Explanation

| *Name*
|Give the portlet a meaningful name.

| *Table columns*
|Decide which information should be displayed.

| *Types*
|Decide which property types the portlet should include.

.*Practical example: order properties*
--

* In plentymarkets, personalised items are sold with the help of order properties.
Example: Your customers should be able to upload a photo that is printed on a t-shirt.
* Order properties are a special type of properties. Customers can choose them in the plentyShop and order them along with the product.

======
Properties and values can be passed down from the main variation to the sub-variations, i.e. they can be inherited.

* If you want to use other properties for the sub-variations, then deactivate the inheritance function and then link the property.
* Properties and values are inherited all together. In other words, you can either have all or none of the values be inherited.

//check this to make sure it's true
[TIP]
.Deleting the links again
======
Click on material:delete[role="darkGrey"] *Delete link* to delete the property link. The property itself will not be deleted. It will simply be removed from the variation.

*_Inheritance logic_*: The following logic applies when you delete a property link:

* Are you removing the property from a main variation? Then the property will also be removed from all of the sub-variations that had previously inherited this property.
* Are you removing the property from a sub-variation, which has the inheritance function activated? Then the inheritance function will be deactivated. The remaining properties will no longer be inherited. Rather, they will be saved directly for the sub-variation.

[TIP]
.Your market isn’t in the list?
====
The drop-down list only includes active referrers.
So if you can’t find a specific market in the list, then open the menu *Setup » Orders » Order referrer* and make sure the market was activated (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

[#290]
=== Client (store)

plentymarkets is a multitenant application.
In other words, you can manage several different areas of business with just one system.

*_Example_*: Imagine you sell medications.
To better reach your target groups, you've split your product line among two webshops.
One shop specialises in natural products and alternative medicine.
The other shop sells traditional medicine.
Your webshops have different names and designs, and your end customers don't know that they are actually the same company.
Nonetheless, you can use just one plentymarkets system to fulfil all of your orders and manage both business divisions.

[.instruction]
Linking a client to the variation:

//tag::link-client[]
. Go to *Item » Item UI » [Open variation] » Element: Client (store)*.
. Choose whichever store (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]) the variation should appear in.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.
//end::link-client[]

[TIP]
.Setting has a blue info-box? Check the stock level!
====
plentymarkets can automatically remove items from the plentyShop if they are no longer in stock.
This automatic function is controlled by the settings in the menu xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Item UI » [Open variation] » Element: Availability and visibility].
More specifically, it’s controlled by the settings *Client automatic availability: Not deliverable if net stock is negative* and *Client automatic visibility: Not visible if net stock is negative*.

If one of these options is activated and the variation is no longer in stock, then a blue info-box will appear here.
Reorder the variation to get it back in stock.
Alternatively, click on *Temporarily make available* if you want to manually make the variation visible in the plentyShop despite the fact that it’s not in stock.

This setting remains valid until new stock is booked for the variation. Once net stock for the variation becomes positive, the availability and visibility settings if net stock is 0 or negative take effect again.
====

[#300]
=== Suppliers

//geht nicht mit include wegen alte/neue UI, aber die Inhalte stimmen fast 1:1 überein mit den Text auf der alte Verzeichnis-Seite und auch mit dem Text unter warenwirtschaft/suppliers

Who supplies you with your products?
Here you can assign each of your products to one or more suppliers.
This is useful so that you can:

* xref:stock-management:new-incoming-items.adoc#[track when each supplier last delivered goods to your company].
* xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#[reorder goods from the supplier when you start to run out].

[TIP]
.Have you already saved contact information for your suppliers?
====
Before you can specify who delivers which product, you first have to create the necessary contact data records for your suppliers.

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *ID*
|The ID of the link between variation and supplier.
This ID is automatically generated by plentymarkets.

| *Supplier name*
|The supplier’s first and last name, as it was saved in the xref:crm:edit-contact.adoc#details-individual-areas[contact data record].

| *Purchase price from account*
|Is your supplier located in a different country and uses a different currency?
Enter the variation’s purchase price in your supplier’s currency.

*_Note_*: Which currency is displayed here depends on which xref:crm:edit-contact.adoc#details-individual-areas[currency was saved in the contact data record].
This currency will be used for xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#[reorders] if it’s available.

| *Purchase price system currency*
|Enter the variation’s purchase price in your own currency.

*_Note_*: Depending on how the settings were configured in the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items*, xref:stock-management:new-incoming-items.adoc#300[this price may be overwritten when goods are received].

| *Minimum purchase*
|The minimum quantity that you have to order from the supplier.

*_Note_*: This value also serves as the xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#170[minimum suggested reorder quantity].

| *Supplier item No.*
|Enter the number under which your supplier manages the variation.

*_Note_*: You can use this number to search for incoming items in the menu *Stock » New incoming items*.

| *Supplier item name*
|Enter the name under which your supplier manages the variation.

| *Last price query*
|Select the date from the calendar when you last queried the price from your supplier.
This date helps you plan price negotiations.

| *Delivery time in days*
|Enter the number of days that your supplier usually needs to deliver reordered variations.

*_Note_*: The delivery time can affect the xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#110[suggested reorder quantity] and the xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#600[delivery date for the reorder].

| *Discount*
|Enter the discount as a percentage if the supplier gives you a discount on the variation.
When reordering items, the discount will only be taken into consideration if you selected the option *Discountable* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

| *Discountable*
|Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to activate the discount that was entered into the *Discount* column.
The discount entered will not be used in reorders if this check mark is not saved.

| *Packaging unit*
|Do you and your supplier use different packaging units?
Enter the supplier’s packaging unit if it differs from xref:item:directory.adoc#180[the number of “units contained” in the item settings].

=== Warehouse

//zukunft - sobald die neue artikel-ui die haupt-ui ist, kann diesen Kapitel als ein include Datei mit Tags gemacht werden, die auch auf die Seite waren:variations-track-stock.adoc ausgegeben wird

Where is the variation stored?
Assign your variations to the appropriate storage locations.
This is useful so that you can:

* xref:stock-management:new-incoming-items.adoc#450[correctly receive incoming goods].
* xref:stock-management:working-with-reorders.adoc#[reorder goods when you start to run out].

[TIP]
.Have you already saved warehouse information?
====
Before you can link variations to storage locations, you’ll need to tell plentymarkets a little bit about your warehouse.
How many zones, racks, shelves and storage locations are there in your warehouse?
xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#[Set up your warehouse] before you continue.
====

[.instruction]
Adding a warehouse:

. Go to *Item » Item UI » [Open variation] » Element: Warehouse*.
. Click on *Add warehouse* (icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]). +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. Select the warehouse that you want to link.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The data will be displayed as a table.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

//zukunft - die beschreibungen in der tabelle verständlicher machen (siehe Schulung mit Oskar) und auch mit den Beschreibungen unter warenwirtschaft:variations-track-stock.adoc angleichen - dafür includes verwenden

[cols="1,4a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Warehouse*
|Here you see the warehouse that was selected.
This is purely informative and cannot be changed.

| *Storage location type*
|Select the storage location type according to the size of the variation.

//this doesn't make sense - in the ui you can choose 1-20 : it doesn't match the warehouse dimensions saved
| *Zone*
|Select a zone if you have set up zones for this warehouse.

| *Reorder level*
|Enter the quantity at which the variation should be reordered.
If the variation’s stock level sinks down to this reorder level, then plentymarkets will automatically suggest that you reorder it. This means that the variation is only reordered once it has reached the reorder level.

*_Note_*: If the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#reorder-value_variation_warehouse[difference between the current stock level and the reorder level] is calculated dynamically, then you can only save the value `0` here.

| *Maximum stock*
|Enter the maximum stock level for the warehouse.
plentymarkets takes the maximum stock level into consideration when suggesting how many copies of an item should be reordered. The suggested reorder quantity will not exceed the maximum stock level entered here.

| *Stock turnover (in days)*
|Enter the number of days that the stock should suffice until the next reorder.
This value is relevant for calculating the reorder quantity.

*_Note_*:
If no value is entered here, then the stock turnover (in days) is not taken into consideration when calculating a reorder date.

*_Practical example_*:
A standard value that could be used for the stock turnover is 14 days.
Once the item has reached the reorder level, the 14 days will be used to calculate how many copies of the item need to be reordered. In other words, the suggested reorder quantity would be sufficient for the following 14 days.

| *Stock buffer*
|Enter a stock buffer.
This causes the stock to be reduced by this value for certain markets.

*_Note_*:
The values entered here are only used for the markets xref:markets:amazon-setup.adoc#[Amazon] and xref:markets:shopgate.adoc#[Shopgate].
The buffer entered here takes priority over the buffer values entered for the particular market.
For markets which are not listed here, the stock buffer settings of the specific market take priority over this setting.

*_Example_*: There are 50 copies of an item in stock.
You want to keep 10 copies of the item as a buffer, so that the item cannot be sold out completely on the market.
This is done by entering 10 as the stock buffer.
As a result, 40 copies of the item are transmitted to the marketplace.

| *Batch*
|Select this option if the batch number should be saved for this variation and warehouse.

*_Note_*: Once stock has been booked into the warehouse, you will no longer be able to deactivate this option.
If the stock level for the warehouse is 0, then it will be possible to activate or deactivate the option.

| *BBD*
|Select this option if the best before date should be saved for this variation and warehouse.

*_Note_*: Once stock has been booked into the warehouse, you will no longer be able to deactivate this option.
If the stock level for the warehouse is 0, then it will be possible to activate or deactivate the option.

| *Suggested storage location*
|Select a storage location that should automatically be suggested when the variation is reordered.

*_Note_*: The standard storage location serves as a placeholder. It means that you haven’t chosen a specific storage location yet.

|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Variation name*; +
*Variation number*; +
*Barcode*; +
*Attributes*
|The overview indicates how many copies of each variation are in stock.
The variation ID, name, number, barcode and attributes tell you which variation the stock information applies to.

| *Warehouse*; +
*Availability*; +
*Bundle*
|Here you see general information about the variation.
You can see which xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#[warehouse] the item is stored in, which xref:item:availability.adoc#[availability level] it has and whether it is an xref:item:combining-products.adoc#[item bundle].

| *Purchase price*
|The variation’s purchase price.

*_Note_*:
In the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Search*, you can decide whether the average purchase price should be displayed here or the purchase price that is currently saved in the variation data record.

//Note that the purchase price saved in the variation data record can also be the average purchase price.
//This depends on which purchase price was saved while receiving the goods.
//In the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items*, you can decide how data should be saved while receiving goods.

| *Value of goods*
|The value is calculated by multiplying the purchase price with the physical stock.

*_Example_*:

* Purchase price = 20 EUR
* Physical stock = 100 copies
* Value of items = 20 x 100 = 2,000 EUR

| *Physical stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are physically in the warehouse.

| *Reserved stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently reserved.

* Stock is reserved when there is a pending order or a warranty.
* The stock stays reserved until the outgoing items are booked or until the order / warranty is cancelled.
* The reserved stock is part of the physical stock because the reserved stock is still present in the warehouse.

| *Reserved stock for listings*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently in an auction on eBay, ricardo or Hood and thus reserved.

*_Background info_*:
In legal terms, listings are binding offers to potential customers. Therefore, it makes sense to be careful and to reserve those items offered in listings, even before they have a concrete order.
Otherwise you might sell more variations than you have in stock.

You can decide whether or not you want items from active listings to be registered as reserved stock in plentymarkets.

. When you create a market listing, select *limited (with reservation)* for the *stock dependence*. This will reserve the listed quantity.
. As soon as a listing was successfully completed, the setting is no longer active.
However, the sold item is now reserved within the order.

| *Reserved stock for bundles*
|Indicates how many item bundles are currently included in pending orders and thus reserved. The quantity of a variation that is reserved by an item bundle is also included in the quantity displayed in the Reserved stock column.

//zukunft - die beschreibung hier etwas klarer schreiben

| *Reorder level*
|You can think of this value as a target value.
In other words, how many copies of the item should ideally be in the warehouse.

| *Reorder level Δ*
|The difference to the reorder level.
This value indicates how many copies need to be sold or reordered before you will get back to the reorder level.

*_Example 1_*:

* Reorder level = 30 copies
* Physical stock = 10 copies
* Reorder level Δ = 20 copies

In this example, we want to have 30 copies of the item.
Currently, there are only 10 copies in the warehouse.
Therefore, we need to reorder 20 copies to get back to the target value.

---

*_Example 2_*:

* Reorder level = 10 copies
* Physical stock = 40 copies
* Reorder level Δ = -30 copies

In this example, we want to have 10 copies of the item.
Currently, there are only 40 copies in the warehouse.
Therefore, we still need to sell 30 copies to get back to the target value.

| *Net stock*
|Indicates how many copies of the item are currently available for sale.
The net stock is a subset of the physical stock.
Substract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.

| *Supply*
|Here you see how many copies of the item are on their way to the warehouse.
This replenishment value indicates how many units are currently being delivered to your warehouse.

[TIP]
.Verknüpfung wieder löschen
====
Open the variation and click on material:delete[role="darkGrey"] in the line of a sales price.
This deletes the link between the sales price and the variation.
The sales price itself is not deleted.
The sales price is simply removed from the variation.
====

[TIP]
.Inheritance behaviour
====
If xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inheritance] is active, then combinations of sales price and monetary price will be passed down from the main variation to the sub-variations.
If you want to maintain individual prices for the sub-variations, deactivate the inheritance and then add the sales price.

=== Bundle

//zukunft - die Artikelpakete Seite gründlich überarbeiten und includes verwenden, um die Inhalte auch hier auszugeben

An xref:item:combining-products.adoc#2000[item bundle] consists of multiple products.
For example, a beard care kit consisting of scissors, a brush, beard oil and beard wax.

In this element:

* you can see the bundle components.
If needed, you can add further components.
* you can activate the settings that automatically calculate the weight and purchase price for item bundles.

[.collapseBox]
.*Adding components to the bundle*
--

. Go to *Item » Item UI » [Open variation] » Element: Bundle*.
. Within the element, click on icon:ellipsis-v[role="darkGrey"] and then on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Add bundle component*. +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. Choose which variations (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) should be added to the bundle.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The data will be displayed as a table.
. Enter the quantity.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

[.collapseBox]
.*Automatically calculating the weight and price*
--

An item bundle is made up of various components.
Each component has its own key figures, such as a weight and a purchase price.
But how do these key figures come together for the entire bundle?
You could enter a weight and purchase price for the entire bundle as a whole.
But there’s also a way to have plentymarkets automatically calculate these figures for you.

. Go to *Item » Item UI » [Open variation] » Element: Bundle*.
. Within the element, click on icon:ellipsis-v[role="darkGrey"] and then on icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] *Configure bundle automatics*. +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. Select the automatic functions as needed (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]).
. Click on *Apply*.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Bundle gross weight: Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|The gross weight is automatically calculated based on the individual components.
That means, the field xref:item:directory.adoc#180[Gross weight in grams] will be greyed out within the element *Content / Dimensions*.

| *Bundle net weight: Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|The net weight is automatically calculated based on the individual components.
That means, the field xref:item:directory.adoc#180[Net weight in grams] will be greyed out within the element *Content / Dimensions*.

| *Bundle net purchase price: Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|The net purchase price is automatically calculated based on the individual components.
That means, the field xref:item:directory.adoc#190[Net purchase price] will be greyed out within the element *Costs*.

| *Bundle moving average purchase price (net): Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|The moving net purchase price is automatically calculated based on the individual components.
That means, the field xref:item:directory.adoc#190[Net moving average purchase price] will be greyed out within the element *Costs*.

|===

////
[TIP]
.Mehrere Artikelpakete gleichzeitig anpassen
====
Use the xref:item:group-functions.adoc#[variation group function or the batch processing function] to calculate the weight and purchase price for multiple item bundles at the same time.
====
////

[TIP]
.Using automatic calculation by default
====
Do you only have a few items that should be excluded from the automatic calculation?
No problem!
You can activate the automatic calculation by default.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Settings*.
. Decide which key figures should be calculated by default.
Use the following options:
* *Bundle automatic for gross weight*
* *Bundle automatic for net weight*
* *Bundle automatic for purchase prices*
* *Bundle automatic for moving average purchase prices*

=== Comments

////
Frage: wie kann man zwischen WYSIWYG und Syntax-Editor wählen?

Irgendwann soll es etwas wie eine Reißzwecke-Symbol geben (wie im Forum), damit man wichtige Notizen oben anpinnen kann.
Soll verhindern, dass wichtige Notizen nach unten wandern, wenn neuere Notizen dazu kommen.
////

Sometimes it can be helpful to save a note for a product.
For example, a note indicating that a specific variation should never be sold for a discounted price.

Here you can see the notes that have already been saved for the variation.
If needed, you can add further notes here.

. Go to *Item » Item UI » [Open variation] » Element: Comments*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"]. +
→ A pop-up window will open.
. Enter the note and format the text as needed.
. Click on *Save*. +
→ The notes are sorted by how current they are. The newest note is at the top and the oldest note is at the bottom.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Character counter
====
In the lower right corner, you can see how many characters have already been entered and how many characters are still available.

* The character counter turns red if you exceed the maximum number of characters.
Any characters that you enter beyond this limit will not be saved.
* HTML characters will also be counted.
That means, if you use the WYSIWYG mode and you only enter one character, the counter will automatically jump to a larger number.
This is because the HTML characters, which surround the letters and are visible in the syntax mode, are also counted.
====

////
noch scheint das nicht möglich zu sein

[TIP]
.Notes are visible in the item overview
====
The xref:item:search.adoc#800[symbols in the item overview] help you quickly see whether a note was saved for the variation.
The symbols are found in the *Procedures* column:

* terra:order_note[role="blue"] = The variation has a note.
Click on this symbol to open a pop-up window where you can directly view and manage your notes.
* terra:order_note_create[role="green"] = The variation does not have a note yet.
Click on this symbol to open a pop-up window where you can directly save a new note.

Depending on how you configured the xref:item:search.adoc#intable-table-type[Table type] filter, this symbol either refers to the main variation or to a specific sub-variation.
In other words:

* Table type Item = There is only one note symbol per item. This symbol manages notes for the main variation.
* Table type Variations = There’s a separate note symbol for each variation.
