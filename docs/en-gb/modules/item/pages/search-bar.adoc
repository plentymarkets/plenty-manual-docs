== Assembling the search bar

[#62]
=== Add the necessary widgets

Which types of search results should be displayed in the plentyShop?
Items, categories or perhaps even a list of suggested search terms (“Did you mean...”)?
Each type of search result is a ShopBuilder widget that you can add to your shop layout and customise individually.

[.instruction]
Assembling the search bar with widgets:

. Go to *CMS » ShopBuilder*.
. Open the <<online-store/shop-builder#32, header element>>.
. Click on the magnifying glass to open the area for search widgets (see GIF).
. If needed, insert a grid with multiple columns.
. Insert some or all of the following widgets:
.. *Header » Search results: Item*
.. *Header » Search results: Categories*
.. *Header » Search suggestions*
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

[#65]
=== Modify the texts

////

////

You can change the widget texts to meet your needs.
For example, you could change the text in the search bar from “Search suggestions” to “Did you mean...”.

[.instruction]
Renaming texts:

. Click on icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] for each of the widgets. +
→ The widget title is outlined in green.
. Rename the text as needed. +
*_Example_*: Change the text from “Search suggestions” to “Did you mean...”.
. Double-click on the text to see a toolbar with formatting options.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

[#67]
=== Customise the appearance

You can modify the appearance of the search bar as needed.
For example, you can decide whether preview images should be displayed and whether the number of matching products should be visible.

[.instruction]
Customising the appearance:

. Click on icon:cog[role="darkGrey"] for each of the widgets. +
→ The widget settings are displayed on the right.
. Customise the settings as needed. +
*_Example_*: Decide whether item images should be displayed in the search results.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="darkGrey"]) the settings.

== Which item data should be considered?

////
den selben Text findet man in die Suchfilter-Seite (frontend-artikelsuche-verwalten.adoc)
once it's been developed, add info that the seller can choose a text property to have a specific variation found under a different term like Blume and Tulpe
////

//tag::boost[]
You decide _which item data_ is relevant to the search function.
During a search, only the item data that you selected will be queried.
You also decide _how heavily weighted_ each piece of item data should be.
The higher the number entered, the higher the item data field will be prioritised in the search result.

[.instruction]
Choosing and prioritising item data:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Search » Frontend » Search settings*.
. Activate the item data fields (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) that should be included in the search results and search suggestions.
. If needed, enter a value into the *Boost* column.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Which boost value should I enter?
====
You can enter any number as a boost value.
The default settings are appropriate in most cases.
These default settings prioritise the variation ID and the item ID.
So if someone searches for a number in your plentyShop, then the search results will give priority to these ID fields.
====

[TIP]
.What’s the difference between search results and search suggestions?
====
* Search results are the items or categories that match the search term.
* Search suggestions are similar words to whatever terms the customer entered.
Search suggestions help customers find what they’re looking for, even if they enter vague or misspelled text.
"Did you mean…​”

*_Note_*: If you activate an item data field for the search suggestions on the right, then the field will automatically be activated for the search results on the left too. Why? Otherwise you would be suggesting customers to use a search term that doesn’t deliver any results.
====
//end::boost[]

[#75]
== Which languages are needed?

////
den selben Text findet man in die Suchfilter-Seite (frontend-artikelsuche-verwalten.adoc)
////

//tag::sprachen[]
The search function can be activated for up to three languages.
The languages German, English and French are activated by default.
If you run plentyShops in other languages, you can select different languages.

[IMPORTANT]
.Search index is completely rebuilt after any changes
====
If you change the language settings, the search index is completely rebuilt.
That means that all items are added to the index again from scratch.
Depending on how many items you have, this process can take several days.
====

[.instruction]
Changing the languages:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Search » Frontend » Languages*.
. Activate or deactivate languages as needed (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]). +
*_Note_*: Only three languages can be activated per system at the same time.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The items are added to the search index for the activated languages.
//end::sprachen[]

== Dealing with partial words

Imagine you sell earbuds.
If a store visitor enters “buds” into the search bar, then no direct results are displayed.
Why not? What can you do about it?

image::item/online-store/assets/partial-words.png[]

Partial words are not directly found.
But you can still do a few things to help your customers find the right products.

* Add the <<item/online-store/search-bar#62, search suggestions widget>> to your search bar.
It is capable of finding partial words.
However, the search suggestions are not associated with specific items/variations, which means that no additional product information is displayed there.
* Go to *Setup » Assistants » Plugins » [Open plugin set] » plentyShop Ceres* and navigate to the step *Search*.
Find the area *Search operator for search results* and select the search operator *“Or” operator*.
This makes it possible for search results with partial search terms to be displayed.
* Save the partial words as <<item/managing-items#50, keywords or descriptive texts>> within your item data records.
Then <<item/online-store/search-bar#70, activate>> the keywords or descriptions for the search results.

[#85]
== Sorting the search results

When a shop visitor enters a term into the search bar and hits “Enter”, he or she will land on a page with search results.
You can decide how the products are sorted on this results page, i.e. which product is displayed first, second, third, etc.

. Go to *Setup » Assistants » Plugins » [Open plugin set] » plentyShop Ceres*.
. Navigate to the step *Search*.
. Find the area *Default sorting of search results*.
. Select the appropriate sorting option from the drop-down list. +
*_Note_*: If you choose *Relevance* or *Recommended*, then use the next steps to specify how exactly the results should be sorted.

.*Can I also create search filters (facets)?*
