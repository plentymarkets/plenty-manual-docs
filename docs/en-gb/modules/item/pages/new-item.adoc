Have you already configured the xref:item:settings.adoc#[preparatory settings]?
For example, have you create a category structure, sales prices and attributes?
Then you’re ready to start entering item data into plentymarkets.
This page teaches you how to manually create items and variations.

The procedure is as follows:

* First you’ll create the xref:item:new-item.adoc#200[item data record].
* If the item is available e.g. in various sizes or colours, then you’ll create xref:item:new-item.adoc#400[all of the necessary variations] in a second step.
* Then you’ll add xref:item:new-item.adoc#500[further product data] like images, texts and stock information.
* Regularly xref:item:new-item.adoc#600[preview the item] in the plentyShop and see where you need to add more product data or adjust the settings.
* xref:item:new-item.adoc#700[Activate the item] once it’s ready to be sold.

.Other ways to create items
====
This page teaches you how to manually create items and variations.
This is useful, e.g. if you only want to add a few new products to your assortment.

But what if you want to add several hundred item data records? It would take far too long to do this manually.
Take a look at the xref:item:import-export-create.adoc#[various tools for importing item information].  Choose the tool that is most appropriate for your situation.

[#100]
== Requirements

This page assumes that you already have basic knowledge of the item structure in plentymarkets.
For example, you should know the xref:item:structure.adoc#[difference between items and variations]. You should also know that item data can be xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inherited].

[TIP]
.A quick refresher on these topics:
====
While creating an item, the first variation is automatically created along with it.
This variation is the xref:item:structure.adoc#300[main variation] and it is closely tied to the item.
The neat thing about the main variation is that its data can be passed on to other variations, i.e. they can inherit its data. As such, the main variation is a parent variation that passes on certain settings to its children.

The xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inheritance function] is activated by default. When a new variation is created, this variation inherits settings from the main variation, as long as no other data is saved.
====

[discrete]
==== The following data should be in the system

Furthermore, make sure you’ve saved the following data in your system before you start manually creating items and variations:

* xref:item:attributes.adoc#[Attributes and attribute values]
* xref:item:categories.adoc#[Categories]
* xref:item:prices.adoc#[Sales prices]


[#200]
== Creating a new item

Create the item data record by entering some basic information about the product.
Don't worry, you can still modify most of this information after it has been created.

The item will not be available for sale immediately.
In other words, your customers will not be able to buy an item that has just been created and is not yet ready to be sold.

This video gives you a playful demonstration of how items are created manually:

.Creating a new item
video::263298729#t=0m48s[vimeo]

[.instruction]
Creating a new item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New*. +
→ The *New item* tab opens. This tab is divided into several areas.
. Carry out the settings.

. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The item will be created along with the main variation and displayed in a new tab.

===== Area: Item data

[cols="1,4"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|[#intable-type]*Type*
a|What sort of item do you want to create? In most cases, you’ll probably create a “normal item”, i.e. an item of the type *Default*.

The other options in the drop-down list are intended for other situations:

* *Default* = Creates a normal item or an xref:item:combining-products.adoc#2000[item bundle].
* *Set* = Creates an xref:item:combining-products.adoc#3000[item set].
* *Multipack* = Creates a xref:item:combining-products.adoc#1000[multipack item].

*_Note_*: This setting can no longer be changed once the item has been created.

|[#intable-id]*ID*
|The item ID is a unique, consecutive number that is used to identify each item in plentymarkets.

*_Recommendation_*: We recommend leaving this field blank. This will cause plentymarkets to automatically assign the next free ID.
We also recommend that you do not change the ID once the item has been created.
Since the ID is linked to many parameters, changing the ID can cause errors.

*_Note_*:
If you enter your own ID while creating an item, then all future IDs will continue on from this ID.
Example: the last item ID was 100.
Afterwards, you created a new item and gave it the ID 50000.
Thus, the next ID will start with 50001.
Even if you delete the item with the ID 50000, the starting value will remain 50001.

| *Manufacturers*
//include mit der Verzeichnis-Seite einbauen

|Who makes this item? Choose the appropriate manufacturer from the drop-down list.

*_Note_*: This list only includes the xref:item:manufacturers.adoc#[manufacturer data records] that you’ve already saved in plentymarkets.

| *Name* +
[red]#(Mandatory field)#
|Enter a name for the item. +
Once you’ve created the item, you’ll be able to save additional names, e.g. if you want the item to have a different name on marketplaces.

|[#intable-flag]*Flag*
|Assign one or two flags to the item.

*_Use case_*: You’ll see the flags when you look at your xref:item:search.adoc#100[items in the overview]. Such visual aids help you find the right items at a glance. You can also xref:item:search.adoc#100[search for items] that have a specific flag or combination of flags.

| **Type**

| Choose **Stocked item** (default setting), **Production item**, **Colli** or **Special order item**. +
**Coli** = Select if the item is to be shipped in several packages. For additional packages, individual items with the stock type Colli must be created in plentymarkets, but these items should not be activated for the plentyShop.

===== Area: Variation » Basic settings

[cols="1,4"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Variation name*
|Enter a name for the main variation.

| *Variation No.*
|Enter a number for the main variation.

*_Recommendation_*: If you leave this field blank, then plentymarkets will automatically assign the xref:item:variation-numbers.adoc#[next available variation number].
The number will be assigned according to the pattern saved in the menu *Setup » Item » Settings*.

| *External variation ID*
|Enter an external variation ID for the main variation.

*_Use case_*: The external variation number facilitates importing items and variations from an external system.

| *Model*
|Enter a model name for the main variation.

| *Content* +
[red]#(Mandatory field)#
|Enter a numerical value and choose a xref:item:units.adoc#[unit] from the drop-down list, e.g. 500ml or 150g.

[discrete]
===== Area: Variation » Category link

[cols="1,4"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|[red]#(Mandatory field)#
|Which category should the item be sorted into? Click on a category to choose it.

If the item should appear in multiple categories, just choose one of them for now. Once you’ve created the item, you can xref:item:managing-items.adoc#300[add the other categories too].

*_Tip_*: Click on a category’s folder icon (icon:folder[role="darkGrey"]) on the far left. This displays the subcategories within.

*_Note_*: This list only includes the xref:item:categories.adoc#[categories] that you’ve already saved in plentymarkets. +
Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New category* if you want to save a new category while creating the item.
This method can save you time but it might also cause you to lose track of your category structure.

[#240]
[discrete]
===== Area: Variation » Attributes

[cols="1,4"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|
|Here you’ll see a list of the xref:item:attributes.adoc#[attributes] that you’ve already created in plentymarkets.

*_Recommendation_*: It’s technically possible to select attributes here. However, we don’t recommend this.
Rather, we recommend that you first create the new item without any attributes. Afterwards, we recommend that you select attributes while you xref:item:new-item.adoc#400[create the necessary variations].

Why? If you link attributes while creating a new item, then all of the following variations will have to be created from the same attributes too. This is not the case if you wait to link attributes while creating variations.
In other words, it makes you much more flexible in the future.

[#250]
[discrete]
===== Area: Variation » Sales prices

[cols="1,4"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

|
a|Here you’ll see a list of the xref:item:prices.adoc#[sales prices] that you’ve already created in plentymarkets.
Here you can save a gross price for the main variation:

. Choose a sales price from the drop-down list and click on *Add* (icon:plus[role="green"]). +
→ This moves the sales price down to the list below.
. Enter the gross price in the field.


*_Alternative_*: Leave this area empty for now and instead, save the price once you’ve created the item. Why?
Once you’ve created the item, you can decide whether you want to enter gross or net prices. You can also have the prices be calculated automatically.
In other words, it makes you much more flexible in the future.
|====


[#300]
== Accessing the item data record in the back end

New items are inactive by default. This prevents customers from buying an item that has just been created and is not yet ready to be sold.

So if you search for a new item data record in the plentymarkets back end, then you will need to change the pre-set search filters so that they include inactive items.

[.instruction]
Displaying inactive items in the overview:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Set the filter *Active* to *ALL*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]).


[#400]
== Creating the necessary variations

Some items like shoes and t-shirts are sold in various sizes and colours.
In other words: your customer doesn’t simply buy your t-shirt, but rather a specific variation of your t-shirt, e.g. in the colour red and the size S.
First, create all of the necessary variations.

[.instruction]
Creating variations:

. xref:item:new-item.adoc#300[Access the item data record] if it isn’t already open.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New*. +
→ The *Create new variations* window opens.
. Carry out the settings. Note <<table-create-variations>>. +
. Click on terra:execute[role="darkGrey"] *Create variations*. +
→ The variations will be created and displayed in the overview.

[[table-create-variations]]
.Creating the necessary variations
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Content*
a|Variations differ from each other in terms of quantity and/or unit.

*_Example_*: A bottle of soap that’s available in 100ml, 250ml and 500ml.

*_Instructions_*:

. Enter the quantity and unit for the first variation, e.g. 100ml.
. Click on terra:execute[role="darkGrey"] *Create variations*.
. Repeat the procedure for 250ml and for 500ml.

| *Attributes*
a|Variations differ from each other in terms of their attribute values.

*_Example_*: A t-shirt that’s available in the colours green or blue and in the sizes S, M or L.

*_Instructions_*:

. Select the colours and sizes (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. Look at the lower right corner and make sure the number of *combinations* seems to be correct. For example, if you combine the colours green and blue with the sizes S, M, L, then you will have 6 variations.
. Click on terra:execute[role="darkGrey"] *Create variations*.
|====

[TIP]
.Number of possible combinations
====
In the lower right corner of the pop-up window, you see how many combinations are being created.
Up to 4000 combinations can be created at one time.
Note that it is possible to create more than 4000 variations.
However, the variations will need to be created in multiple cycles.
====

////
[TIP]
.Selecting attributes for variations
====
If you select attributes for the main variation, the selected attributes will be available for all additional variations of the item. If you create an item without selecting attributes for the main variation, then it will be possible to select all of the attributes that are available in the system when you create variations later. Once you have created a variation with attributes, it will only be possible to create additional variations of the item with these attributes or without any attributes.

If you delete all variations of an item where the main variation has no attributes, then it will be possible to select all of the attributes that are available in the system when creating new variations. Therefore, you only have to delete the variations of an item without deleting the item itself, in order to make new attributes available for this item. Once you have created variations for an item, attributes can no longer be deleted or added. To delete or add attributes, all variations with attributes must be deleted from the item.
====

[#500]
== Adding further product data

At this point, you’ve created the item data record and saved some basic information about it.
But you can still add xref:item:managing-items.adoc#[lots of other product information] to the data record, e.g.:

* xref:item:managing-items.adoc#90[Images]
* xref:item:managing-items.adoc#50[Texts]
* xref:item:managing-items.adoc#240[Prices]
* xref:item:managing-items.adoc#314[Stock information]

[#600]
== Looking at the item in the front end

Are you curious what the new product looks like in your plentyShop?
See a preview of the item and find out where you need to add further product data or adjust the settings.

[.instruction]
Viewing a preview of the item:

. Click on *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) in the toolbar. +
→ The *Client (store)* window opens.
. Decide which *plugin set* and *client* you want to use when viewing a preview of the item. +
*_Tip:_* These settings are preselected next time you click on the preview icon.
. Click on terra:execute[role="darkGrey"] *Execute*. +
→ A preview of the item is shown.


[#700]
== Putting the item up for sale

Variations are not visible to customers in the plentyShop until they have been activated.
In other words, you can work on inactive variations without your customers noticing.
You activate the variation when you’re ready for it to be visible in your plentyShop.

[.instruction]
Activating a variation:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. xref:item:search.adoc#400[Search for and open the variation].
. Find the *Availability* area within the *Settings* tab.
. Select the *Active* option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).
. *Save* (terra:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Complete checklist for item visibility
====
Not only do items need to be activated, but they also need to have a price, a category and positive net stock.
Otherwise customers wouldn’t be able to buy the item.

Work through xref:item:checklist-items-visibility.adoc#[this checklist] and make sure your item meets all of the requirements for being visible in the plentyShop.
This checklist helps you find any possible errors that are preventing your items from being displayed.
