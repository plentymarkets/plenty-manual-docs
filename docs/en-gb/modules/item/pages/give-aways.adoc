Use give-aways to generate more revenue in your plentyShop by motivating your customers to buy more items and more frequently. The basic idea is simple: You offer customers a free, give-away item if they spend a certain amount of money in your store. Instead of adding these give-aways to each order manually, you can use an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedure] to automate this process.

This video offers you an introduction to the topic:

You can also add promotional items that arenâ€™t sold in your plentyShop. To do so, set the variation to *invisible* and then assign it to an invisible category, i.e. a category that is not activated for the plentyShop.

[TIP]
.Tip: Bonus item scale
====
Use more than one event procedure to offer a bonus item scale. This allows you to offer different variations depending on the value of items customers buy. In the first event procedure, for example set the item value filter to *&gt;=  100.00 GBP* and *&lt; 200.00 GBP*. In the second event procedure, set an item value filter of *&gt;=  200 GBP* and select a different, more attractive variation.
