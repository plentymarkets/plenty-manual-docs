Prices are an important topic for any business.
Thanks to plentymarkets, you can be very flexible with your prices.

* First, you can <<item/settings/prices#100, define the conditions>> under which your products are sold at a specific price.
For example, you can sell products for a lower price in your plentyShop than on Amazon.
Or you can sell products cheaper to B2B customers than to B2C customers. In plentymarkets, such conditions are called _sales prices_.
* Second, you can save <<item/settings/prices#900, prices for each individual variation>>.
For example, if you sell a t-shirt in S, M, L and XL, then you can decide whether the XL variation should be a bit more expensive than the rest.
* Third, you can have plentymarkets <<item/settings/prices#1000, automatically calculate your monetary prices>>.
For example, you could start out with the item’s purchase price and then add transportation costs, storage costs and taxes. Finally, you could add a 7% profit margin on top.

== Sales prices

Sales prices define the _conditions_ under which a variation is sold at a specific price.
For example, you can sell products for a lower price in your plentyShop than on Amazon. Or you can sell products cheaper to B2B customers than to B2C customers.

New plentymarkets systems come equipped with _two default sales prices_.
Take a look at these default sales prices and use them to get acquainted with the topic.
Feel free to modify the default sales prices and/or create entirely new sales prices.

[#200]
=== Creating new sales prices

Sales prices are created and managed centrally in plentymarkets.
You can either create new sales prices with the help of an _assistant_ or you can manually create new sales prices in the _setup menu_.

Either way, you’ll customise the sales prices to meet your needs.
You’ll give the sales prices names and you’ll decide which currencies, customer classes, marketplaces or other conditions should apply.

[.tabs]
====
In the setup menu::
+
--
Create any number of sales prices to map the entire range of your prices in plentymarkets.
During the process, you’ll give the sales prices names and you’ll decide which currencies, customer classes, marketplaces or other conditions should apply.

. Go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices*.
. Click on icon:plus[role="green"] *New*. +
→ The *New* tab opens.
. Carry out the settings. Note <<table-create-sales-price>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty, role="green"]) the settings.
. Finally, <<item/settings/prices#900, link the sales prices>> to individual variations.

IMPORTANT: To avoid errors, you should not configure multiple sales prices with exactly the same conditions, i.e. with exactly the same mix of settings.
Example: If you create two different sales prices that are both valid for B2B customers, Amazon UK and the country UK, then plentymarkets will not know which sales price to use.
plentymarkets will randomly choose one of the sales prices since both apply equally.

[cols="1,3"]
|======
|Setting |Explanation

| *Subscription int.*
|This option is relevant if you offer plugins on plentyMarketplace on a subscription basis.

*_Note_*: This option is neither relevant for the plentyShop nor for the scheduler or subscription module.

| *Position*
|Enter the position number.
If you <<item/settings/prices#900, link multiple sales prices to a variation>>, then you’ll see these sales prices sorted by their position number in the item data record.

| *Internal name EN*
|Enter a name for the sales price.
This name appears in a variety of different places within your plentymarkets back end. For example, you’ll choose the sales price by name when you <<item/settings/prices#900, link it to individual items>>.

| *External name EN*
|Enter an external name for the sales price.
Currently, this name is not displayed in the plentyShop.

| *Minimum quantity*
|Should the sales price only apply if a customer buys _multiple copies of the item_?
For example, let’s assume you sell socks for 6 EUR per pair. Do you want the price to be reduced to 5 EUR per pair if a customer buys 3 or more pairs of socks?
If so, then enter the quantity that applies to this sales price.

*_Tip_*: Add _even more_ quantity-based sales prices to create a sliding scale of prices.

| *Currency*
|Which currencies should the sales price apply to?
Select them from the list (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

*_Background info_*: While configuring your plentyShop, you’ll decide which <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#220, languages>> and <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#201, currencies>> your store should be available in.
For example, let’s assume that customers can choose the currencies EUR, PLN, CHF and GBP from the header.
Then it would make sense to also save prices for these currencies.

*_Automatic conversion_*: Activate the option *Live conversion* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to have plentymarkets automatically convert your prices from the <<payment/currencies#30, standard currency>>, e.g. EUR, into the other currencies, e.g. PLN, CHF and GBP. +
If you _don’t_ activate this option, then your prices will all have the same number, but different currencies, e.g. 19 EUR and 19 PLN. Therefore, it usually makes sense to have plentymarkets automatically convert the prices.

Make sure you’re happy with the <<payment/currencies#20, conversion factors>> saved in the menu *Setup » Orders » Payment » Currencies*.

| *Price type*
|Which type of sales price do you want to configure? In most cases, you’ll create a _standard sales price_.

But in some cases, you might want to create an “RRP”, “set price” or “special offer” instead.
If so, then select the corresponding price type (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

*RRP* = A recommended retail price, which only serves to show the price difference between the RRP and a standard sales price. In the plentyShop, the RRP is displayed in strikethrough text next to the sales price. Products cannot be sold for the recommended retail price.

*Special offer* = The price for a promotional offer or deal. For example, a special offer that’s only available on Amazon for a limited time.

*Set price* = <<item/use-cases/combining-products#3000, Sets>> are a way to combine products and sell them as a unit. If you decide to combine products and sell them as a set, then you’ll also need to give the individual set components a set price.

| *Display*
|Should this sales price _automatically_ be linked to new item data records?
If so, then activate the option *Always display for new items* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

If this setting is deactivated, then you will still be able to <<item/settings/prices#900, manually add the sales price to items>>.

| *Client*
|Should the sales price only apply to specific clients (stores)? If so, then select all of the stores (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that this sales price should apply to.

*_Background info_*: With plentymarkets, you can manage several online stores, i.e. <<online-store/setting-up-clients#, several clients>>, with only one software. Consequently, it is possible to manage several different areas of business with one plentymarkets system.
That’s a great advantage. But it also means that you’ll always need to tell plentymarkets which online store the sales price applies to.

| *Class*
|Should the sales price only apply to specific customer classes? For example, do you want to sell products cheaper to B2B customers than to B2C customers?
If so, then select all of the customer classes (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that this sales price should apply to.

*_Frequent source of errors_*: To avoid errors, you should not configure multiple sales prices with exactly the same conditions, i.e. with exactly the same mix of settings.
Example: If you create two different sales prices that are both valid for B2B customers, Amazon UK and the country UK, then plentymarkets will not know which sales price to use.
plentymarkets will randomly choose one of the sales prices since both apply equally.

*_Note_*: <<crm/managing-contacts#15, Create the necessary customer classes>> in advance, if they don’t already exist in your plentymarkets system.

| *Country*
|Should the sales price only apply to specific countries of delivery? For example, you probably pay different tax rates in different countries. As such, you might want to sell an item for a slightly higher price in some countries, rather than pay the difference yourself.
Select all of the countries (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that this sales price should apply to.

| *Referrer*
|Should the sales price only apply to specific distribution channels? For example, do you want to sell the item for a lower price in your plentyShop than on Amazon?
Select all of the platforms (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) that this sales price should apply to.

*_Frequent source of errors_*: To avoid errors, you should not configure multiple sales prices with exactly the same conditions, i.e. with exactly the same mix of settings.
Example: If you create two different sales prices that are both valid for B2B customers, Amazon UK and the country UK, then plentymarkets will not know which sales price to use.
plentymarkets will randomly choose one of the sales prices since both apply equally.

*_Note_*: If you select eBay or Amazon, then the corresponding account settings will appear further below. Here you’ll tell plentymarkets which eBay or Amazon account the sales price should apply to.
Therefore, <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#, link your eBay or Amazon account to plentymarkets>> in advance.

| *Amazon accounts*
|Tell plentymarkets which Amazon account the sales price should apply to.
Therefore, <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#, link your Amazon account to plentymarkets>> in advance.

This setting is greyed out until you select an Amazon platform from the list above.

| *eBay accounts*
|Tell plentymarkets which eBay account the sales price should apply to.
Therefore, <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#, link your eBay account to plentymarkets>> in advance.

This setting is greyed out until you select an eBay platform from the list above.

=== Applying the sales price to products

Sales prices are linked to <<item/introduction/structure#, individual variations>>, rather than to the item as a whole.
For example, if you sell a t-shirt in S, M, L and XL, then you can decide whether the XL variation should be a bit more expensive than the rest.

There are a few different ways to link sales prices to variations and enter the actual monetary prices:

* If you only want to save prices _for a few items_, then it makes sense to <<item/managing-items#240, manually link sales prices and enter monetary amounts>>.
* If you want to save prices _for lots of items_, then we would recommend <<item/import-export-create/import#800, importing the sales prices and monetary amounts>>.
Alternatively, you could also import this data with an <<welcome/assistants#, assistant>>.
* Rather than manually entering the monetary amounts, you might want plentymarkets to <<item/settings/prices#1000, automatically calculate them for you>>.

[#1000]
== New price calculation

Let plentymarkets calculate your prices for you.
For example, start with the purchase price and then add transportation costs, storage costs and taxes.
Finally, add a 7% profit margin on top.
With plentymarkets, you decide how your prices should be calculated.

You’ll select the price calculation by its name, e.g. when you apply it to specific variations.

| icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] *Active*
a|The price calculation will only be applied to products if it is active.
In other words, you can try out new formulas and rounding behaviours, without causing the item prices to be recalculated.

==== Formula

How should the price be calculated?
For example, you could start with the purchase price and then add transportation costs, storage costs and taxes.
Finally, you could add a 7% profit margin on top.
In this case, the formula might look something like this: +
`(Purchase + Transport + Storage + VAT) * 1.07`

[cols="1,4"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Purchase price*
|Corresponds to the net purchase price under: +
<<item/managing-items#280, Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Option: Net purchase price>>

The purchase price is either calculated automatically or managed manually depending on how the settings were saved in the menu *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items*.

| *Mov. avg. purchase price*
|Corresponds to the moving average purchase price under: +
<<item/managing-items#280, Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Option: Moving average purchase price (net)>>

It is recalculated every time stock is booked in. It is calculated from the purchase prices of all stocks that are available for the variation in the warehouse.

*_Note_*: Go to *Setup » Stock » Stock » Incoming items* and see which warehouses were activated with the setting *Warehouse for moving average price*. The moving average purchase price only takes items into account that were booked into one of these warehouses. If no warehouse is active, then no moving average purchase price is calculated.

| *Transportation costs*
|Corresponds to the net transportation costs under: +
<<item/managing-items#280, Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Option: Net transportation costs>>

| *VAT +
(standard client)*
|Corresponds to the percentage of VAT under: +
<<item/managing-items#280, Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Option: VAT>>

*_Note_*:
In the variation, the VAT is saved as a percentage.
In the formula, you'll need to convert the percentage into a decimal number.
Example: You can turn `7%` into `1.07` by entering `(1 + VAT / 100)`.

| *Customs*
|Corresponds to the percentage of customs under: +
<<item/managing-items#280, Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Option: Customs>>

*_Note_*:
In the variation, the customs surcharge is saved as a percentage.
In the formula, you'll need to convert the percentage into a decimal number.
Example: You can turn `11,2%` into `1.112` by entering `(1 + Customs / 100)`.

| *Operating costs*
|Corresponds to the percentage of operating costs under: +
<<item/managing-items#280, Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Option: Operating costs>>

*_Note_*:
In the variation, the operating costs are saved as a percentage.
In the formula, you'll need to convert the percentage into a decimal number.
Example: You can turn `7%` into `1.07` by entering `(1 + Operating costs / 100)`.

| *Storage costs*
|Corresponds to the net storage costs under: +
<<item/managing-items#280, Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Option: Net storage costs>>

| *Extra shipping charge 1*; +
*Extra shipping charge 2*
a|Corresponds to the extra shipping charge under: +
<<item/managing-items#290, Tab: Settings » Area: Shipping » Option: Extra shipping charge 1 and 2>>

This is a fee that should be charged _in addition_ to the normal shipping costs. Such extra shipping charges are useful for large or bulky items that are particularly expensive to ship.

* Extra shipping charge 1 applies to the first item.
* Extra shipping charge 2 applies to each additional item.

*_Additional settings_*: In each of your <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, shipping profiles>>, specify whether these extra charges should be added to the basic shipping costs.

The manual also includes several <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1100, example calculations for extra shipping charges>>.

Which sales prices should the formula calculate?
For example, you might want to calculate the prices for your plentyShop with this formula and the prices on Amazon with a different formula.

| *Target price*
a|Select the appropriate sales price from the drop-down list.

*_Why can’t I select some of the sales prices?_* +

* To avoid duplicate target prices.
For example, if you selected the plentyShop as the target price in the first line, then you cannot select the plentyShop as the target price again in the second line.
* To avoid errors.
It is not possible to set a sales price as the target price if it is currently being used as a variable.

| *Rounding direction*
a|Which direction should the prices be rounded in?

* *Mathematical* = The calculated prices will either be rounded up or down.
The direction depends on whether the price is above or below a certain threshold.
For example, the rounding behaviour *To x.99* has a threshold of 49 cents.
If a calculated price ends with x.48, then the price is rounded down.
If a calculated price ends with x.49, then the price is rounded up.
* *Round up* = The calculated price will always be rounded up.
* *Round down* = The calculated price will always be rounded down.

| *Decimal places*
a|Enter the appropriate number of decimal places.
The calculated price is cut off at this point.

*_Examples_*:

* Calculated price: 199.123456
* 4 decimal places: 199.1234
* 2 decimal places: 199.12

*_Why can’t I enter decimal places?_* +
Most rounding behaviours are inherently limited to 2 decimal places.
If you select one of these rounding behaviours, then you will not be able to enter decimal places.

==== Adding further calculations

Each price calculation is made up of one or more _calculation building blocks_.
Within each building block, you’ll:

* <<item/settings/prices#1300, create a formula>>
* <<item/settings/prices#1400, select target prices and rounding behaviour>>

image::item/settings/assets/further-calculation.gif[]

The first building block automatically appears when you create the price calculation.
Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Calculation* to add further building blocks and thus build your formulas on each other.
For example, you could use the first calculation to create a base formula.
And you could use additional calculations to modify this formula even further.

[TIP]
.Previous formulas turn into variables
====
The neat thing about this building block format is that you can re-use previously created formulas.
They turn into <<item/settings/prices#1350, variables>>, which you can select in the calculator.

=== Applying the calculation to products

[.tabs]
====
Manually::
+
--
If you only want to save the price calculation _for a few items_, then it makes sense to manually link the price calculation.

include::../import-export-create/create/directory.adoc[tag=apply-price-calculation]

--
Import::
+
--
If you want to save the price calculation _for lots of items_, then we would recommend linking the price calculation <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#, via import>>.
Use the <<data/importing-data/sync-types/elasticSync-item#, import type Item>> and the mapping field *Item variations / Price calculation UUID* to do so.

Enter the price calculation's UUID into the CSV file.
This applies the calculation to the variation's prices.

*_Tip_*: You can copy the price calculation UUID.
Open the menu *Item » Price calculation » [Open price calculation]*.
Click on the UUID in the lower left corner.
The UUID is copied to the clipboard.

*_Import the price calculation UUID last_*:
Imagine your prices are calculated with the following formula: `(PurchasePrice + TransportCosts) * 1.07`.
In this case, import the purchase price and transportation costs first and then the price caluclation second.
Otherwise plentymarkets won't have all of the information it needs to correctly calculate the price.

. <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#1500, Create a mapping>>, which imports the purchase price and transportation costs.
. <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#1500, Create another mapping>> in the same import. Use this one to import the price calculation UUID. +
→ The mappings are processed one after the other.

Group function or batch processing::
+
--
If you want to save the price calculation _for lots of items_, then we would recommend linking the price calculation via group function or batch processing.

[discrete]
===== Variation group function

include::../import-export-create/create/mass-processing.adoc[tag=variation-group-function]

. Activate the option *Price calculation* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and select an existing calculation from the drop-down list.
. Click on icon:execute[set=plenty] *Execute* to apply the settings to the variations.

[discrete]
===== Batch processing

include::../import-export-create/create/mass-processing.adoc[tag=variation-batch-processing]

. On the _right_, activate the option *Price calculation* (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) and select an existing calculation from the drop-down list.
. Click on icon:execute[set=plenty] *Apply* to apply the settings to the variations.

--
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Only one price calculation per variation
====
Only one price calculation can be linked to a variation.
Imagine you've already linked a price calculation to a variation.
Then you link a second price calculation to the same variation.
In this case, the second price calculation would overwrite the first one.
Both price calculations can not simultaneously be linked to the variation.

Nonetheless, it's still possible to calculate prices differently, e.g. in the plentyShop and on Amazon.
This is done by adding <<item/settings/prices#1500, multiple calculation building blocks>> to your price calculation.

=== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[.collapseBox]
.*Which actions cause prices to be recalculated?*
--

* *_Modifying a price calculation_*: Saving changes to an active calculation (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]) will cause prices to be recalculated.
More specifically, prices will be recalculated if you change a value within a calculation building block (formula, target price, rounding behaviour).
Simply saving without changes or modifying the name will not cause prices to be recalculated.
Saving opens a pop-up window.
You will be asked to confirm your decision.
You will see how many variations are affected.
* *_Modifying the value for a variable_*: Imagine your prices are calculated with the following formula:
`(Purchase + Transport + Storage + VAT) * 1.07`.
If you change a product’s purchase price, transportation costs, storage costs or VAT, then new data will flow into the formula and the price will be recalculated.
<<item/settings/prices#1350, The variables>> that can be added to a formula are constantly being monitored for changes.

*_Note_*: Prices are not recalculated immediately.
Rather, the recalculation starts after a short delay (about 3 minutes).

--

[.collapseBox]
.*When will my prices be recalculated?*
--

Prices are not recalculated immediately.
Rather, the recalculation starts after a short delay (about 3 minutes after it is triggered).
For example, if you change a product’s purchase price, then the recalculation will begin approximately 3 minutes later.

Why not immediately?
Often, more than just one change is made to a product.
For example, you might need to change a product’s purchase price and its transportation costs.
If the prices were recalculated immediately, then the first recalculation might not even be finished before the second one starts.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*What happens if a value is missing from the formula?*
--

The price will not be calculated.
Imagine your prices are calculated with the following formula:
`(Purchase + Transport + Storage + VAT) * 1.07`.
In this example, if you forgot to save a purchase price for an item, then its price will not be calculated.
<<item/settings/prices#2000, Open the error log>> to see if any values are missing for your products.
The error log tells you which variations cannot be calculated and why.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*What happens if the calculated price is 0?*
--

plentymarkets prevents prices from accidentally being saved with the value 0.00.
Both before and after rounding, the system checks whether the calculated price is 0.
If this is the case, then the price will not be saved and the <<item/settings/prices#2000, error log>> will include information about the problem.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*What happens if I choose a target price that isn’t yet linked to the variation?*
--

No problem.
When the price calculation is triggered, the sales price will be linked to the variation and the monetary price will be calculated.

--

[.collapseBox]
.*Can I apply multiple price calculations to the same variation?*
--

No.
Only one price calculation can be linked to a variation.
Imagine you've already linked a price calculation to a variation.
Then you link a second price calculation to the same variation.
In this case, the second price calculation would overwrite the first one.
Both price calculations can not simultaneously be linked to the variation.

Nonetheless, it's still possible to calculate prices differently, e.g. in the plentyShop and on Amazon.
This is done by adding <<item/settings/prices#1500, multiple calculation building blocks>> to your price calculation.
