== Group functions

Use the group function to edit several items or variations at once.
You’ll directly choose the items or variations that should be edited.
For example, you can use the group function to:

* choose the items that should be included in a special sale.
* increase the price of all the variations that are manufactured by a certain company.

[#200]
=== Item group function

. Go to *Item » Item UI*.
. xref:item:item-search.adoc#100[Set search filters as needed and start the search].
. Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the items to be edited.
. In the toolbar, click on material:layers[role="darkGrey"] *»* material:layers[role="darkGrey"] *Item group function*. +

| *Delete item images*
|Choose this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to delete all of the item images for the selected items.

| *Delete second item image*
|Choose this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to delete the second item image for the selected items.
|===

.Item settings
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Action | Explanation

| *Condition*
|What condition are the selected items in?
Select the appropriate condition from the drop-down list.

| *Flag 1*; +
*Flag 2*
|Assigns one or two flags to several items at once.

| *Manufacturer*
|Who makes the selected items?
Select the appropriate xref:item:manufacturers.adoc#[manufacturer] from the drop-down list.

| *Manufacturing country*
|Which country were the selected items manufactured in?
Select the appropriate manufacturing country from the drop-down list.

| *Revenue account*
|Enter up to 11 digits for the xref:orders:accounting.adoc#800[revenue account].

| *Serial number*
|This option is only relevant for items with serial numbers.
Use this option to xref:item:serial-numbers.adoc#900[make several items scannable] at once.

| *Store special*
|Should the selected items be featured in a xref:item:store-specials.adoc#[store special]?
If so, then specify whether you want to call the item a special offer, a new item or a top item.

| *Update set prices*
|This option is only relevant for xref:item:combining-products.adoc#3900[item sets]. Use this option to update the so-called “from price” for several items at once.
|===

.Marketplace specific item settings
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Action | Explanation

| *Amazon FBA*
|Should the selected items be sold via FBA?

include::markets:partial$amz-variation-availability.adoc[tag=amazon-fba-note]

icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] = Yes, the item is sold via FBA. +
icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] = No, the item is not sold via FBA.

| *Amazon product type*
|
include::markets:partial$amz-variation-availability.adoc[tag=product-type]
include::markets:partial$amz-variation-availability.adoc[tag=product-type-export]

include::markets:partial$amz-variation-availability.adoc[tag=product-type-note]

| *Create listing*
|Choose this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to create listings on eBay, Hood or Ricardo for the selected items.

*_Additional settings_*: Did you xref:item:managing-items.adoc#_listing_default_settings[save a listing template for the item]?
The listing template specifies, e.g. whether the listings are for eBay, Hood or Ricardo.
If the item doesn't have a listing template, then the system will try to create an eBay listing by default, since this is the most common situation.

**__Example__**: Imagine you want to create a Hood listing. In this case, you will need to save a listing template for the item.
plentymarkets knows that it should create Hood listings because the Hood account is saved in the template.

| *FBA Fulfillment*
|
include::markets:partial$amz-variation-availability.adoc[tag=fba-fulfillment]

| *Listing template*
|Choose a xref:markets:ebay-setup.adoc#5500[previously created listing template] to link it with this item.

| *Update item timestamp for market exports*
|Sets the *Last change* timestamp to the current date and time.

*_Background_*: Sometimes it’s necessary to update the timestamp, e.g. xref:markets:best-practices-amazon-item-data-export.adoc#200[if you want to sell the item on Amazon].
This is because items are only exported to Amazon if they were edited within the last 24 hours.
|===

.Shipping profiles
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Action | Explanation

| *Delete existing shipping profiles*
|Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if you want to remove existing xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1000[shipping profiles] from the item.

*_Note_*:
The shipping profiles themselves will not be deleted. They will simply be removed from the item.

| *Shipping profiles*
|How are the selected items shipped?
Select all of the appropriate xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1000[shipping profiles] from the drop-down list (icon:check-square[role="blue"]).

*_Note_*:
Use this action together with the action *Delete existing shipping profiles* if you want the new shipping profiles to replace the existing ones.
In other words, if you want the existing shipping profiles to first be removed from the item data record.

.Availability and visibility
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Action | Explanation

| *Active*
|

icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] = Activates the selected variations. +
icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] = Deactivates the selected variations.

*_Background info_*:
Variations only become visible in the plentyShop or on marketplaces once they have been activated.
In other words, you can work on inactive variations without your customers noticing.
xref:item:checklist-items-visibility.adoc#[Complete checklist for visibility].

| *Always invisible in item list*
|Corresponds to the option xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Availability and visibility » List automatic visibility » Always invisible in item list].

| *Clients (stores)*
|Which plentyShops do you want to sell the selected variations in?
Activate all of the appropriate clients.

icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] = Activates the client for the selected variations. +
icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] = Deactivates the client for the selected variations.

| *Deliverable if net stock is positive*
|Corresponds to the option xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Availability and visibility » Client automatic availability » Deliverable if net stock is positive].

| *Displayed delivery time*
|How long is the variation’s delivery time?
Select the appropriate availability level from the drop-down list.

| *Make available for client despite negative net stock*
|Corresponds to the button *Temporarily make available* in the menu xref:item:directory.adoc#290[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Client (Store)].

*_Background info_*: plentymarkets can automatically remove variations from the plentyShop if they are no longer in stock.
This automatic function is controlled by the settings in the menu xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Availability and visibility].

Use this group function if you want to manually make the variation visible in the plentyShop despite the fact that it’s not in stock.

This setting remains valid until new stock is booked for the variation. Once net stock for the variation becomes positive, the availability and visibility settings if net stock is 0 or negative take effect again.

| *Not deliverable if net stock is negative*
|Corresponds to the option xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Availability and visibility » Client automatic availability » Not deliverable if net stock is negative].

| *Not visible if net stock is negative*
|Corresponds to the option xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Availability and visibility » Client automatic visibility » Not visible if net stock is negative].

| *Not visible in item list if net stock is negative*
|Corresponds to the option xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Availability and visibility » List automatic visibility » Not visible in item list if net stock is negative].

| *Sales channels*
|Which marketplaces do you want to sell the variation on?

. Select (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) all of the appropriate markets from the drop-down list.
. Activate (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]) or deactivate the markets as needed.

| *Stock limitation*
|Should plentymarkets monitor the variations’ stock levels?

[cols="1,4a"]
!===

! *None*
!This setting is useful for situations where you could technically count the stock units, but it doesn’t matter whether the stock is negative or not.
The product is available, just without any particular stock value.

*_Note_*: Some marketplaces only consider the stock value that is assigned to the variation.
So if you select this setting, then the marketplace might never have an active offer for the product because it might never understand this as a positive stock value.
Check how your target marketplaces will interpret the stock limitation setting before you begin selling on them.

! *To net stock*
!This is the most commonly used option.
It prevents you from accidentally overselling items.
The stock is limited to the net stock.
This net stock level is transmitted to marketplaces.

*_What does net stock mean?_* +
This number indicates how many copies of the item are currently available for sale.
The net stock is a subset of the physical stock.
Substract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.
xref:stock-management:managing-stocks.adoc#100[Further information].

! *Do not administer stock for this variation*
!This setting is useful for situations where it would be very time-consuming to count the stock units.
For example, imagine you sell construction supplies and you have millions of copies of a screw.

*_Note_*: Some marketplaces only consider the stock value that is assigned to the variation.
So if you select this setting, then the marketplace might never have an active offer for the product because it might never understand this as a positive stock value.
Check how your target marketplaces will interpret the stock limitation setting before you begin selling on them.

*_Note_*: If this setting is selected, then the variation’s *Stock* tab will not include the sub-tabs *Correction*, *Stock*, *Supply* and *Item movement*.

!===

| *Visible if net stock is positive*
|Corresponds to the option xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Availability and visibility » Client automatic visibility » Visible if net stock is positive].

| *Visible in item list if net stock is positive*
|Corresponds to the option xref:item:directory.adoc#220[Item » Item UI » [Open variation\] » Element: Availability and visibility » List automatic visibility » Visible in item list if net stock is positive].

| Action | Explanation

| *Bundle gross weight: Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|Should the gross weight automatically be calculated based on the bundle components?

icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] = Activates the automatic calculation. +
icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] = Deactivates the automatic calculation.

*_Note_*:
This setting is only relevant for xref:item:combining-products.adoc#2500[item bundles].

| *Bundle moving average purchase price (net): Automatically calculate from bundle components*
|Should the moving average purchase price automatically be calculated based on the bundle components?

icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] = Activates the automatic calculation. +
icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] = Deactivates the automatic calculation.

*_Note_*:
This setting is only relevant for xref:item:combining-products.adoc#2500[item bundles].

| *Bundle net purchase price: Automatically calculate from bundle components*

.Sales prices
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Action | Explanation

| *Price calculation*
|Select an existing xref:item:prices.adoc#1000[price calculation] from the drop-down list.
This will link the price calculation to the selected variations. The variations’ prices will be calculated accordingly.

| *Sales price*
|Edits the prices of all the selected variations. How exactly the prices are edited depends on how you configured the settings.

. Select a source price and target price.
. Select an operator and enter an absolute value or a percentage.

---

*_Examples_*:

* Imagine you want all of the selected variations to have their prices increased by 2.50 EUR on Amazon.
. Select the same sales price as the source and target.
In this case, the Amazon sales price.
. Select the type absolute, the operator \+ and the value 2.50.

* Imagine you want the selected variations to be 3% more expensive on Zalando than in your plentyShop.
. Select the plentyShop sales price as the source and the Zalando sales price as the target.
. Select the type percentage, the operator \+ and the value 3.

[cols="1,4"]
!===

!*Source price*
!Select a sales price from the drop-down list. This price will be used as the starting point.

!*Target price*
!Select a sales price from the drop-down list. This price will be changed.

*_Note_*: If there is no monetary price saved for the variation as this target sales price, then the sales price will be linked and the new monetary price will be saved. +

*_Note_*: If any of the selected variations currently inherit prices from the main variation, inheritance of all prices is deactivated and the prices are saved on the variation level.

!*Absolute*
!Select an operator and enter an absolute value. +
= The value entered is saved as the new price. +
+ The current price is increased by the amount entered. +
- The current price is decreased by the amount entered. +
* The current price is multiplied by the value entered. +
/ The current price is divided by the value entered. +

!*Percentage*
!Select an operator and enter a percentage. +
+ The current price is increased by the percentage entered. +
- The current price is decreased by the percentage entered. +

!===
|===

.Tags
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Action | Explanation

| *Add tags*
|Which tags do you want to link to the variation?
Click into the field and select the tags that should be linked to the variation.

*_Note_*:
Use this action together with the action *Remove all tags* if you want the new tags to replace the existing ones.
In other words, if you want the existing tags to first be removed from the variation data record.

| *Remove all tags*
|Select this option (icon:toggle-on[role="blue"]) if you want to remove _all of the existing_ xref:item:flags.adoc#400[tags] from the variation.

*_Note_*:
The tags themselves will not be deleted.
They will simply be removed from the variation.

| *Remove tags*
|Do you want to remove _a few specific_ xref:item:flags.adoc#400[tags] from the variation?
Click into the field and select the tags that should be removed from the variation.

*_Note_*:
The tags themselves will not be deleted.
They will simply be removed from the variation.
|===

.Variation settings
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Action | Explanation

| *Categories*
|Select a category and click on *Apply*.
The category will be linked to the selected variations.

*_Note_*:
By default, existing category links remain unchanged.
So select the option *Delete existing category links* if you want the new category to replace all of the existing categories. In other words, if you want the existing categories to first be removed from the variation data record.

*_Note_*:
It’s only possible to link one category at a time.
So you’ll need to use the group function multiple times if you want to link multiple categories.
We recommend using the button *Execute* rather than *Execute & close*.
This allows you to directly link one category after another, without having to re-start the group function and re-select the category action each time.

*_Note_*:
If you select a main category, i.e. a category that also has further sub-categories, then only the main category will be linked.
The sub-categories will not be linked.
This is because it’s only possible to link one category at a time.

| *Customs tariff number*
//nach Umstrukturierung, includes verwenden, da Inhalt gleich ist wie für das Varianten-Datenfeld
//wird von 11 auf 14 Zeichen gehoben

|Enter the xref:orders:accounting.adoc#620[customs tariff number].
In plentymarkets, it’s possible to save a different customs tariff number for each variation.

*_Example_*: In some countries, children’s clothing is taxed differently depending on the size.
In this case, it makes sense to save the customs tariff number separately for each variation.

*_Inheritance_*: The customs tariff number is automatically xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[passed down] from the main variation to the sub-variations. This means:

* you don’t need to enter customs tariff numbers for your sub-variations if you want them to have the same customs tariff number as the main variation.
* you’ll need to enter a different customs tariff number for all of the sub-variations that should differ from the main variation.

| *Generate GTIN*
|Select a GTIN type from the drop-down list.
This type of GTIN will be generated for the selected variations xref:item:barcodes.adoc#300[from the number range].

//old
| *Gross weight*; +
*Net weight*
|Enter a value in grams.
This weight will be saved for the selected variations.

| *Inheritance*
|Changes the xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inheritance behaviour] for prices, availability levels, categories, etc.
In other words, specifies whether the data should be passed down from the main variation to whichever sub-variations were chosen in the overview.

. In the left drop-down list, select the appropriate data (prices, availabilities, categories, etc.).
. In the right drop-down list, specify whether the inheritance should be activated or deactivated.

[cols="1,4"]
!===

! *Activate*
!The data (prices, availabilities, categories, etc.) will be passed down from the main variation to whichever sub-variations were chosen in the overview.
Data that was previously saved for the variation will be overwritten.

! *Deactivate*
!Deactivates the inheritance function.
The main variation’s data will be saved for the sub-variation.
!===

*_Note_*: This group function controls the inheritance of all prices, categories, suppliers etc. saved for the main variation.
It is not possible for individual prices, categories, suppliers, etc. to be inherited.

| *Show unit price*
|Should the unit price be displayed in the plentyShop?

icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] = Yes, the unit price will be displayed for the selected variations. +
icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] = No, the unit price will _not_ be displayed for the selected variations.

| *Update variation timestamp for market exports*
|Sets the *Last change* timestamp to the current date and time.

.Warehouse and Shipping
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Action | Explanation

| *Extra shipping charge 1*; +
*Extra shipping charge 2*
|Enter a fee that should be charged in addition to the normal shipping costs.
Such extra shipping charges are useful for large or bulky items that are particularly expensive to ship.

* Extra shipping charge 1 applies to the first item.
* Extra shipping charge 2 applies to each additional item.

*_Additional settings_*: In each of your xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1000[shipping profiles], specify whether these extra charges should be added to the basic shipping costs.

*_Note_*: The manual also includes several xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1100[example calculations for extra shipping charges].

| *Main warehouse*
|Select the variation’s main warehouse from the drop-down list.

| *Warehouse settings*
|Select a warehouse from the drop-down list.
This will link the warehouse to the selected variations.
Additional settings will be displayed.

[cols="1,4"]
!===

! *Maximum stock*
!Enter the maximum stock level for the warehouse.
plentymarkets takes the maximum stock level into consideration when suggesting how many copies of an item should be reordered. The suggested reorder quantity will not exceed the maximum stock level entered here.

! *Reorder level*
!Enter the quantity at which the variation should be reordered.
If the variation’s stock level sinks down to this reorder level, then plentymarkets will automatically suggest that you reorder it. This means that the variation is only reordered once it has reached the reorder level.

*_Note_*: If the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#reorder-value_variation_warehouse[difference between the current stock level and the reorder level] is calculated dynamically, then you can only save the value `0` here.

! *Stock turnover (in days)*
!Enter the number of days that the stock should suffice until the next reorder.
This value is relevant for calculating the reorder quantity.

*_Note_*:
If no value is entered here, then the stock turnover (in days) is not taken into consideration when calculating a reorder date.

*_Practical example_*:
A standard value that could be used for the stock turnover is 14 days.
Once the item has reached the reorder level, the 14 days will be used to calculate how many copies of the item need to be reordered. In other words, the suggested reorder quantity would be sufficient for the following 14 days.

! *Storage location type*
!Select the storage location type according to the size of the variation.

! *Zone*
!Select a zone if you have set up zones for this warehouse.
