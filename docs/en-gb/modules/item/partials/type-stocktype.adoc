!Stock type !Explanation

! *Stocked item*; +
*Production item*; +
*Special order item*
!These types do not have a pre-defined function.
However, they are well-suited for differentiating between various types of products.

*_Example of use_*:
Imagine you sell mass-produced items and custom-made items.
Orders that include custom-made items need to be processed differently.
In this case, you could designate your mass-produced items as "Stocked items" and your custom-made items as "Special order items".
Then you could set up an event procedure, which automatically switches orders containing custom-made items to a particular status.

! *Colli*
!Select if the item is to be shipped in several packages.
For additional packages, individual items with the stock type Colli must be created in plentymarkets, but these items should not be activated for the plentyShop.

*_Note_*:
You are limited to these four stock types.
It is not possible to create additional stock types.
