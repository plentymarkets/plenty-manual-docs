ifdef::import[]
Should the variation automatically be visible in the plentyShop when the net stock is positive?
Enter your answer into the CSV file.

*_Note_*: Both of the “client visibility” options complement each other and are only applied if the <<item/managing-items#intable-limitation, Limitation>> option is set to *To net stock*.

*_Relationship to other settings_*: Both of the “client visibility” options take priority over the <<item/managing-items#intable-item-list, item list>> options.
We recommend that you either control the visibility with the “client” option or the “item list” option.
They should not be combined.

*_Default value_*: `0`
