You can use {which-group-plural} to sort the additional options and services that you offer under one heading.
Let’s stick with the example that you sell wedding rings and you want to let customers choose an optional gold or diamond trim.
You can create a {which-group-singular} called "Trim" to clearly display these options.
Within this group, customers can choose the options “Gold trim” or “Diamond trim”.
