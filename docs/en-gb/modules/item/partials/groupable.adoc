Should variations that have this attribute be displayed individually or cumulatively in the plentyShop?

* *Check mark* = Each variation will be displayed as an individual product in the plentyShop.

*_Example:_* you sell a shoe with 2 attributes: colour and size. You want each shoe colour to look like an individual product in the plentyShop, but not each size. In this case, you’ll check this option for the attribute “colour” and you you won’t check this option for the attribute “size”. +
When customers browse through the category in your plentyShop, they’ll see each colour variation as a separate product. If a customer clicks on a colour variation, then he will be taken to the item’s webpage. Here the customer will see a drop-down list, which he can use to select the appropriate shoe size.

*_Relationship to other settings:_* Check your settings for the <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#90, item view and category view in the plentyShop LTS plugin>>. The option *Show variations by type* can affect the option *Groupable in item lists* and vice versa.
