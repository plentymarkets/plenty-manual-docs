*_Note_*: In plentysystems, it’s possible to save a different customs tariff number for each variation.

*_Example_*: In some countries, children’s clothing is taxed differently depending on the size.
In this case, it makes sense to save the customs tariff number separately for each variation.

*_Inheritance_*: The customs tariff number is automatically xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[passed down] from the main variation to the sub-variations. This means:

* you don’t need to enter customs tariff numbers for your sub-variations if you want them to have the same customs tariff number as the main variation.
* you’ll need to enter a different customs tariff number for all of the sub-variations that should differ from the main variation.
