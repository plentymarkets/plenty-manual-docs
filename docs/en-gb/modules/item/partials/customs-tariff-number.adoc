ifdef::export[]
The variation’s customs tariff number.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: <<item/managing-items#280, Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Entry field: Customs tariff number>>
endif::export[]

*_Note_*: In plentymarkets, it’s possible to save a different customs tariff number for each variation.

*_Example_*: In some countries, children’s clothing is taxed differently depending on the size.
In this case, it makes sense to save the customs tariff number separately for each variation.

*_Inheritance_*: The customs tariff number is automatically <<item/introduction/inheritance#, passed down>> from the main variation to the sub-variations. This means:

* _you don’t need to enter customs tariff numbers_ for your sub-variations if you want them to have the same customs tariff number as the main variation.
* _you’ll need to enter a different customs tariff number_ for all of the sub-variations that should differ from the main variation.
