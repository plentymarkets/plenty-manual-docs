| Setting | Explanation

| *Delete item*
|Choose this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to delete the selected items and their variations.

| *Delete item images*
|Choose this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to delete all of the item images for the selected items.

| *Delete second item image*
|Choose this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to delete the second item image for the selected items.

| *Create listing*
|Choose this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) to create listings on eBay, Hood or Ricardo for the selected items.

*_Additional settings_*: Did you <<item/managing-items#_listing_default_settings, save a listing template for the item>>?
The listing template specifies, e.g. whether the listings are for eBay, Hood or Ricardo.
If the item doesn't have a listing template, then the system will try to create an eBay listing by default, since this is the most common situation.

**__Example__**: Imagine you want to create a Hood listing. In this case, you will need to save a listing template for the item.
plentymarkets knows that it should create Hood listings because the Hood account is saved in the template.

| *Update timestamp for market exports*
|Sets the *Last change* timestamp to the current date and time.

*_Background_*: Sometimes it’s necessary to update the timestamp, e.g. <<markets/amazon/best-practices-amazon-item-data-export#200, if you want to sell the item on Amazon>>.
This is because items are only exported to Amazon if they were edited within the last 24 hours.

| *Update price from in sets*
|This option is only relevant for <<item/use-cases/combining-products#3900, item sets>>. Use this option to update the so-called “from price” for several items at once.
