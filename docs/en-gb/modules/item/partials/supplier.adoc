Who supplies you with this item? Assign one or more suppliers to your items. By saving this data in plentymarkets, you will be able to <<stock-management/new-incoming-items#450, keep track of the goods you receive >>later. You will also be able to <<stock-management/managing-reorders/working-with-reorders#, reorder items directly from the supplier>> when you start to run out of stock.

[TIP]
.Have you saved the contact data?
====
In plentymarkets, suppliers are nothing more than contact details. So before you can link a supplier to an item, you’ll need to create the contact data record in plentymarkets.

The procedure is the same as when <<crm/managing-contacts#, creating a normal contact data record>>. However, you’ll need to <<crm/managing-contacts#20, choose “supplier” as the type>>.
