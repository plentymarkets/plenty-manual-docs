//tag::pim-preamble[]
PIM stands for [.underline]##P##roduct [.underline]##I##nformation [.underline]##M##anagement.
The plentysystems PIM lets you manage all of your item information in one central system.
In other words, you enter your product information into plentysystems.
Then you can sell your items on various xref:markets:markets.adoc#[markets], in your own xref:online-store:online-store.adoc#[plentyShop] and in your xref:pos:pos.adoc#[brick and mortar store].

If you need to make any changes in the future, e.g. edit an item's price or description, then you'll only have to modify this data centrally in plentysystems.
The data can automatically be changed on all of your sales channels.

== Introducing the new item user interface

The menu *Item » Items* is structured as follows:

image::item:menu-overview.png[]

* *Navigation*:
Here you can navigate through different parts of the menu.
The currently selected area (blue font) is displayed in the main window on the right.
If you open several items or variations at once, then they will be displayed underneath each other.
Click on icon:bars[role="darkGrey"] to expand or collapse the navigation bar.

* *Toolbar*:
Here you can perform relevant actions. For example:
** xref:item:search.adoc#100[search for items and variations].
** xref:item:directory.adoc#1000[save your changes to items or variations].

* *Main window*:
Here you can see whichever area is currently open.
** *Overview*:
When you start a search, you’ll see the xref:item:search.adoc#500[results in an overview].
The overview provides information about the items at a glance.
For example, you can see an image of the item, whether the item is active or inactive, its IDs, prices, tags and timestamps.

** *Detail view*:
When you open an item, its details are displayed in the main window on the right.
But what if the main window is empty?
Or what if you’re not happy with how the item details are arranged?
You can xref:item:detail-view.adoc#200[create a new detail view] and customise it to meet your needs.

== The item structure

//tag::intro[]
Are you new to plentysystems?
Before you start entering data, learn how items are structured!
The introduction teaches you about the topic and answers your basic questions:

* What’s the difference between xref:item:structure.adoc#[items and variations]?
* How does xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inheritance] work?
* Where do I find my xref:item:search.adoc#100[items in the back end]?
* Can I also see a few xref:item:search.adoc#900[example items]?
//end::intro[]

[#200]
== Preparatory settings

//tag::preparatory-settings[]
Items are made up of lots of information, e.g. categories, prices and manufacturers.
But before you can sort an item into a specific category, the category first needs to exist in plentysystems.
Before you can select an item’s manufacturer, the manufacturer data needs to exist in plentysystems.
//end::preparatory-settings[]

Once you’ve saved such xref:item:settings.adoc#[preparatory settings] in plentysystems, you’ll be able to apply them to all of the relevant items and variations.
