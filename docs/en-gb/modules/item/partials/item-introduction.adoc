Items are managed centrally in plentymarkets.
In other words, you’ll enter your product information into plentymarkets.
Then you can sell your items on various <<markets#, markets>>, in your own <<online-store#, plentyShop>> and in your <<pos#, brick and mortar store>>.

If you need to make any changes in the future, e.g. edit an item's price or description, then you'll only have to modify this data centrally in plentymarkets.
The data can automatically be changed on all of your sales channels.

== Introducing the item structure

//tag::intro[]
Are you new to plentymarkets?
Before you start entering data, learn how items are structured!
The introduction teaches you about the topic and answers your basic questions:

* What’s the difference between xref:item:structure.adoc#[items and variations]?
* How does xref:item:inheritance.adoc#[inheritance] work?
* Where do I find my xref:item:search.adoc#100[items in the back end]?
* Can I also see a few xref:item:search.adoc#900[example items]?
//end::intro[]

== Preparatory settings

//tag::preparatory-settings[]
Items are made up of lots of information, e.g. categories, prices and manufacturers.
But before you can sort an item into a specific category, the category first needs to exist in plentymarkets.
Before you can select an item’s manufacturer, the manufacturer data needs to exist in plentymarkets.
//end::preparatory-settings[]

Once you’ve saved such xref:item:settings.adoc#[preparatory settings] in plentymarkets, you’ll be able to apply them to all of the relevant items and variations.
