ifdef::manual[]
When you create a new category, the URL name will initially be the same as the category name.
If necessary, change the name to be used for the URL.
This name is used to form the category URL.
endif::manual[]

ifdef::import[]
Enter a URL name into the CSV file.
This name is used to form the category URL.

*_Default value_*: URL name = Category name

*_Permitted import values_*: Alpha-numeric

[TIP]
Also use the drop-down lists to select the language and the webstore.

You can find the result of the import in the back end menu: <<item/settings/categories#intable-url, Item » Category » Tab: Settings » Entry field: URL name>>

*_Example_*: The URL name `new-category` will transform into the URL `www.your-domain.com/new-category`
endif::import[]

ifdef::export,catalogue[]
The category’s URL name.

Corresponds to the option in the menu: <<item/settings/categories#700, Item » Category » [Open category] » Tab: Settings » Entry field: URL name>>
endif::export,catalogue[]

ifdef::manual,import[]
*_Note_*:
You can re-use URL names as long as they are used in different categories or on different levels.
Within one category, however, the URL names may only be used once per level.

*_SEO tip_*:
Because no client (store) is selected when the category is created, the automatically created URL is not indexed by search engines.
However, in terms of SEO it is best not to change the URL name after the category has been activated for a client.

*_Important_*:

* URL names cannot consist only of numbers.
* URL names cannot contain special characters. As such, only enter ASCII code.
* Do not enter the following characters at the beginning of a URL name: +
a-, b-, c-, f-, fa-, p-, t- +
These prefixes are deleted automatically. For instance, "a-class" is changed to "class" automatically. For example, for a category named "a-class", you should enter the URL name "aclass".
