|Corresponds to the lock symbol in <<item/managing-items#360, Tab: Availability » Area: Client (store)>>.

*_Background info_*: plentymarkets can automatically remove variations from the plentyShop if they are no longer in stock. This automatic process is controlled by the settings in <<item/managing-items#360, Tab: Settings » Area: Availability>>.

Use this group function if you want to manually make the variation visible in the plentyShop despite the fact that it’s not in stock.

This setting remains valid until new stock is booked for the variation. Once net stock for the variation becomes positive, the availability and visibility settings if net stock is 0 or negative take effect again.

| Setting | Explanation

| **Extra shipping charge 1; +
Extra shipping charge 2**

| *Customs tariff number*
//nach Umstrukturierung, includes verwenden, da Inhalt gleich ist wie für das Varianten-Datenfeld

a|Activate and enter a <<orders/accounting#620, customs tariff number>>.
In plentymarkets, it’s possible to save a different customs tariff number for each variation.

*_Example_*: In some countries, children’s clothing is taxed differently depending on the size.
In this case, it makes sense to save the customs tariff number separately for each variation.

*_Inheritance_*: The customs tariff number is automatically <<item/introduction/inheritance#, passed down>> from the main variation to the sub-variations. This means:

* _you don’t need to enter customs tariff numbers_ for your sub-variations if you want them to have the same customs tariff number as the main variation.
* _you’ll need to enter a different customs tariff number_ for all of the sub-variations that should differ from the main variation.
