ifdef::manual[]
Select this option (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) if the variation should only be accessible via the direct URL.
If the option is activated, then the variation will always be invisible in your plentyShop item lists.
This means, the variation will not appear in the categories, search results, store specials, cross-selling lists and lists of last seen items.
endif::manual[]

ifdef::import[]
Should the variation always be invisible in your plentyShop item lists?
Enter your answer into the CSV file.

*_Background info_*:
This causes the variation to only be accessible via the direct URL.
The variation will not appear in the categories, search results, store specials, cross-selling lists and lists of last seen items.

*_Relationship to other settings_*: Both of the <<item/managing-items#intable-client-visible, client visibility>> options take priority over the "item list" options.
We recommend that you either control the visibility with the “client” option or the “item list” option.
They should not be combined.
