[TIP]
.Variation-specific surcharge
====
You might have already saved a surcharge <<item/use-cases/personalised-items#30, while creating the property>>.
But what should you do if not every variation should be given the same surcharge?
Once you’ve linked the property to a variation, you can enter a variation-specific surcharge, which overwrites the surcharge that was saved for the property as a whole.
