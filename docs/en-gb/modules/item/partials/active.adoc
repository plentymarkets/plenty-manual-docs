*_Background info_*:
Variations only become visible in the plentyShop or on marketplaces once they have been activated. In other words, you can work on inactive variations without your customers noticing.

*_Back end search_*: inactive variations are _not_ found with the <<item/introduction/search#100, default search settings>>.
Set the search filter *Active* to *No* if you want inactive items to be included in the search results.
