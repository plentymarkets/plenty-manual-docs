This page of the manual describes how you export the list of delivery addresses to your shipping service provider and then import the package numbers, which you receive from your shipping service provider, into your plentymarkets system. You can print shipping labels after you have registered your orders online with your shipping service provider. Furthermore, you learn how to set up address label templates and generate delivery lists.

How you set up all other documents that are available in plentymarkets, such as invoice, order confirmation or delivery note, can be found in the <<orders#, Orders>> area.

[#export-list-of-delivery-addresses]
== Exporting a list of delivery addresses

If you ship packages with a shipping service provider, you need a list of delivery addresses. This list is an export of shipping information that you have to hand over to your shipping service providers. The shipping service provider - in return - can then provide you with valid shipping labels. This export allows to get larger quantities of packages ready for shipment quickly and easily. In the following, you learn how to export your orders' delivery addresses into a file, which you need for your shipping service provider's software.

If you have questions about importing the file into the shipping service provider's software or about using the software itself, contact the provider.

[.instruction]
Exporting a list of delivery addresses:

. Go to *Orders » Fulfilment*.
. Expand the *List of delivery addresses* section (icon:plus-square-o[]).
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-export-list-of-delivery-addresses>>.
. Click on the gear-wheel icon (icon:cog[]). +
→ You receive a file that you save on your computer.
. Afterwards, import the file with your shipping service provider's software.

[#import-package-numbers]
== Importing package numbers

Besides the convenient option to import package numbers into your system via the <<fulfilment/generating-documents#package-numbers-elasticsync, import tool>>, you can also import the package numbers <<fulfilment/generating-documents#manually-import-package-numbers, manually>> or with the help of a <<fulfilment/generating-documents#package-numbers-barcode-scanner#, barcode scanner>>.

[#package-numbers-elastic-sync]
=== Importing package numbers via the import tool

Using the import tool is the easiest way to import package numbers in your plentymarkets system. To do so, create an import of the type *Orders*. Note our <<data/importing-data/elasticsync-best-practices/best-practices-elasticsync-package-numbers-fulfilment#, Best Practice: Importing package numbers from shipping service providers>>.

[#manually-import-package-numbers]
=== Manually importing package numbers

In the *Orders » Fulfilment* menu in the *Import of package numbers* tab in the *List import* section, you can manually enter the package numbers with the corresponding order ID. Alternatively, you can use a barcode scanner to scan these from the packing list. You find a description of how to proceed in the <<fulfilment/generating-documents#package-numbers-barcode-scanner, next chapter>>.

[#package-numbers-barcode-scanner]
=== Importing package numbers with the help of a barcode scanner

The outgoing items should be booked in plentymarkets once an order is finished being packed. *Status [7] Outgoing items booked* is saved for the order and the current date is saved as the date for the outgoing items. For example, this operation can be carried out by scanning the barcode on the invoice, delivery note, packing list or the address label. Make sure that your barcode scanner is correctly set up.

The following example describes the scanning process of the packing list.

[.instruction]
Importing package numbers with the help of a barcode scanner:

. Go to *Orders » Fulfilment*.
. Expand the *Generating invoices* section (icon:plus-square-o[]).
. Generate one or multiple invoices. For further information, refer to the explanations on the <<orders/order-documents/generating-invoices#, Invoices>> page of the manual.
. Create a packing list from these invoices for all orders that need to be packed this time. For further information, refer to the explanations on the <<orders/order-documents/packing-list#, Packing list>> page of the manual.
. As soon as a package has been packed, mark this order on the packing list.
. Additionally, place another small sticker with the package number (light label) underneath the order ID's barcode.
. Go to *Orders » Fulfilment*.
. Click on the *Import of package numbers* tab.
. Place the cursor in the first field in the *List import* section.
. First scan the order ID and afterwards the package number. +
→ By clicking on *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]), the package numbers is saved for all orders in the *Settings* tab.

Set up an event procedure in the *Setup » Orders » Event procedures* menu. Select the procedure *Order > Book outgoing items* for the event *Order change > Package number*. Furthermore, you can send your customers an email template including the package number and the link for tracking the package. For further information, refer to the <<automation/event-procedures#, Event procedures>> page of the manual.

[#set-up-address-label]
== Setting up the address label

In contrast to shipping labels, you can precisely define which information should be displayed for address labels in plentymarkets and where it should be positioned on the label. These address labels do not yet include the shipping charges or the shipment numbers, as they were not generated by the shipping provider. Using address labels is especially recommended in certain situations. For example, when shipping books, it is sometimes possible to write book mail on the package and ship it for a cheaper price than the weight of the package. In plentymarkets, you can configure the address label templates, generate a PDF file and use it to print labels.

[TIP]
.When does it make sense to use the software of a parcel service?
====
Generate address labels in plentymarkets to send your items. If you would like to ship packages with a parcel service, we recommend that you use the software of the parcel service in order to print shipping labels.
====

If you have already created an address label template and saved a PDF template, continue with chapter <<fulfilment/generating-documents#generate-address-label, Generating the address label>>.

[#address-label-template]
=== Creating an address label template

Before being able to print address labels, you have to create a template. Proceed as described below to create a new template.

[.instruction]
Creating an address label template:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Documents » Address label*.
. Click on the *New template* tab.
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-create-address-label-template>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Positioning with coordinates
====
The content is positioned on a label by entering coordinates (X, Y). The upper left corner of the label is assumed to be the start point.
