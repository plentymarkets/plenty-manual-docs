In the *Orders » Shipping centre 2.0* menu, you can use the integrated interfaces to control all of the processes that are related to shipping your items. You cannot only <<#search-order, search>> for and <<#edit-single-order, edit>> shipping orders but also register shipping orders directly with a shipping service provider or alternatively create a polling file or order summary to hand it over to a shipping service provider. By using the <<#group-function, group function>>, you can, for example, register multiple orders or returns at the same time or reset multiple orders at the same time.

The *Orders » Shipping centre 2.0* menu is structured as follows:

image::fulfilment/assets/shipping-centre-2.0-menu-structure.png[width=640, height=360]

* *Navigation*: Here you can navigate through different parts of the menu. The currently selected area (blue font) is displayed in the main window on the right. If you open several shipping orders at once, they will be displayed underneath each other. Click on icon:bars[] to expand or collapse the navigation bar.
* *Toolbar*: Here you can <<#search-order, search>> for shipping orders, <<#configure-columns, configure columns>>, set the results to be shown per page and click through the pages with the shipping orders. +
*_Note:_* The standard filter is set to the date range of the last 4 weeks up to and including today’s date.
* *Main window*: Here you can see whichever area is currently open.
** *Overview*: When you start a search, you’ll see the results in an overview. The overview provides information about the shipping orders found at a glance. For example, you can see the shipping service provider the order was registered with, the number of packages contained in the order and the recipient region.
** *Detail view*: When you open a shipping order, its details are displayed in the main window on the right. The detail view of a shipping order is divided into the following areas: <<#overview, Overview>>, <<#recipient, Recipient>>, <<#packages, Packages>> and <<#returns, Returns>>.

[WARNING]
.Difference between cancelling an order and resetting an order
======
If you cancel an order in the shipping centre, the registration is cancelled in plentymarkets and also with the shipping service provider. This means that the order will _not_ be picked up.

If you reset an order, it is available as a pending order in plentymarkets. However, it is still registered with the shipping service provider and you are billed for it. The *Reset* function simply resets the registrations. The order itself will _not_ be cancelled with the service provider. Therefore, we recommend that you always cancel the order.

*_Note:_* It is only possible to use the cancelation function within a single order, _not_ via the group function. For further information, refer to the <<#cancel-order, Cancelling a single order>> chapter.

[#reset-order]
=== Resetting a single order

Note the end of the shipping day that you defined with your shipping service provider. When the end of the shipping day is reached (this is often a point in time between 4:00 and 6:00 pm), you can only reset the order, but it is not possible to <<#cancel-order, cancel>> it any longer.

 

[#difference-reset-cancel]
[WARNING]
.Difference between cancelling an order and resetting an order
====
If you cancel an order in the shipping centre, the registration is cancelled in plentymarkets and also with the shipping service provider. This means that the order will _not_ be picked up.

If you reset an order, it is available as a pending order in plentymarkets. However, it is still registered with the shipping service provider and you are billed for it. The *Reset* function simply resets the registrations. The order itself will _not_ be cancelled with the service provider. Therefore, we recommend that you always cancel the order.
====

Proceed as described below to reset a single order.

[.instruction]
Resetting a single order:

. Go to *Orders » Shipping centre 2.0*.

Once the return has been successfully registered, the return label is available in the *Returns* area of the order. Click on *Return label* (icon:order_open[set=plenty]) to save the label on your computer and print it afterwards.

<<#image-return-label>> shows as an example a return that was registered with DHL Retoure Online with the setting that one label is generated per package. If multiple packages are available, one PDF file per return label is generated.

 

[[image-return-label]]
.Printing the return label
image::fulfilment/assets/shipping-centre-return-label.png[width=640, height=360]

Besides the manual option, you can, for example, use DHL Retoure Online to automatically generate the return labels via an event procedure or a process:

The following options are both available in the event procedures and in the processes:

* *Plugins > Generate DHL Retoure Online label*
** Registers the return with DHL Retoure Online. One label per order is generated, regardless of the number of packages.

* *Plugins > Generate DHL Retoure Online label (1 label per package / 1 file)*
** Registers the return with DHL Retoure Online. One label per package is generated. If multiple packages are available, one PDF file with all return labels is generated.

* *Plugins > Generate DHL Retoure Online label (1 label per package / multiple files)*
** Registers the return with DHL Retoure Online. One label per package is generated. If multiple packages are available, one PDF file per return label is generated.

You can select the options mentioned above in the following areas of the plentymarkets back end:

* in the procedure group *Plugins* of the event procedures
* as *Return type* in the procedure *Return label* in the processes
* in the shipping centre when registering the return

For further information about the *DHL Retoure Online* plugin, refer to the <<fulfilment/shipping-service-provider-plugins/plugin-dhl-retoure-online#, DHL Retoure Online>> page.

You only have to link the email template where you saved this setting with an event procedure to ensure that the email template will be sent automatically to your customers once the event occurs.
