Many sellers decide to hire a service provider to ship items on their behalf. Depending on the services that were agreed upon in your contract, the service provider may be hired to pick up the items from your business, send your items and then report the status back to your plentymarkets system.

plentymarkets allows customers to manage their fully customised shipping processes and trigger nearly all processes automatically. Your plentymarkets system efficiently controls the entire shipping process using <<automation/processes/setting-up-processes#, processes>>. It carries out everything from linking items with shipping profiles to registering shipments and printing shipping labels. The initial time that it takes to carry out the settings pays off when you have an efficient shipping process that automatically carries out routine tasks.

This page of the manual describes how you prepare the shipping process and which <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2500, shipping service provider-specific settings>> you need to carry out. Some service providers offer a complete service which includes storing and packing the items. For further information, refer to the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#4700, Overview of fulfilment service providers>>.

This video teaches you how to set up your shipping settings with *DPD UK* as an example.

== Setting up countries of delivery

Set up the countries that you want to ship your items to in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* menu in the *Countries of delivery* tab. The overview contains a list of all the countries of delivery that are available in plentymarkets. The country names used in the system are displayed in the column *Standard name*. The standard name cannot be changed and is _not_ visible for your customers. Use the column *Name* to enter the name that is displayed to your customers in the online shop, e.g. an alternative spelling or an abbreviation.

== Creating a region

Regions are groups of all countries of delivery that have the same shipping costs.

Click on the *New region* tab and create the necessary regions by selecting the countries of delivery that belong to each region. The regions become available and can be edited in the *Overview* tab.

Before creating the regions, plan carefully which and how many regions you need for grouping together your countries of delivery in a useful way. This is important because _shipping costs are entered in the shipping profiles for each region_ and not for each country of delivery. Sellers located in the United Kingdom would likely need the following 3 regions at minimum. Also pay attention to the different island regions for which you presumably might determine higher shipping costs than for mainland deliveries. <<#list-postcodes-island-regions, Here>> you can find a list of the postcodes for island regions that are saved on the system side in plentymarkets.

[TIP]
.Have you activated the necessary countries of delivery?
====
Make sure that you activated all of the necessary countries of delivery before you create regions. A country of delivery can only be assigned to one region. After it has been assigned, it is no longer available for other regions.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a region:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Regions* tab.
. Click on the *New region* tab. +
→ The *Available countries* column lists all of the countries of delivery that are not yet assigned to any region.
. Select the desired countries of delivery in the *Available countries* column.
. Use the arrows to move these countries of delivery to the *Selected countries* column. +
*_Note:_* Use the double arrow buttons to move all of the countries from one column to the other.
. Enter a name for the region into the *Name* line.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The newly created region is displayed in the *Overview* tab.
. Follow the same pattern to create other regions until all countries of delivery are assigned to a region and the list of *Available countries* is empty.

[IMPORTANT]
.Assign all countries of delivery
====
All countries of delivery have to be assigned to a region. Otherwise, it is not possible to create a valid shipping profile.
====

[discrete]
=== Editing a region

Proceed as follows to edit the region.

[.instruction]
Editing a region:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Regions* tab.
. Expand the region in the *Overview* tab (icon:angle-down[]).
. Make changes to the settings as needed.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Conditions for deleting a region
====
A region can only be deleted if it is no longer being used in the shipping profiles. If you receive an error message while deleting a region, check whether there are still settings for this region saved within the table of shipping charges. A region can only be deleted once all of these connections are completely removed.

|Enter the shipping service provider name as it should be displayed in the shopping cart and on the invoice. You can either enter the real name of shipping service providers, e.g. `DHL`, or you can enter a more general term like `insured shipping`. Or determine a combination of both: `DHL Insured shipping`. This name is visible for your customers in the online shop.

| *Name (back end)*
|Enter the shipping service provider name as it should be displayed in your system. You can either enter the real names of shipping service providers, e.g. DPD or DHL, or you can enter an alternative name that describes the shipping service provider, e.g. _Swiss shipments_. This name is _not_ visible for your customers in the online shop.

| *Shipping service provider*
|Select the shipping service provider. This is especially important if you entered an alternative description under *Name* and/or if you did not use a tracking URL.

|====

[#840]
[TIP]
.Tracking URL
====
Many shipping service providers allow customers to track their packages with tracking URLs. Customers see the tracking URL when they place their order or they receive the URL in an email. Enter the template variable `$TrackingURL` into your email template.

A functional tracking URL should include the package number and the recipient's postcode. Therefore, make sure that your tracking URLs include the template variables `$PaketNr` and, if necessary, `$PLZ`.

The currently valid, known tracking URLs can be found in the chapter of the shipping service provider. Via the <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2500, Overview of shipping service providers>> you can quickly access the chapters of the shipping service providers.

[#1000]
== Creating a shipping profile

The individual shipping profiles are different shipping methods, which your customers can choose later on during checkout or which are assigned automatically to certain types of orders by the online shop. For example, you can offer your customers a cheap standard delivery and a more expensive express delivery. You can also set up another shipping profile for eBay listings which the system exclusively uses for orders from the market eBay. Find tips and tricks in the sub-chapters which you can make use of when creating your shipping profiles. Afterwards, it is describes how you create <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1500, tables of shipping charges>> for every shipping service provider and region.

Now create the shipping profile for the shipping service provider. The number of shipping profiles depends on the required shipping services. Create a different shipping profile for every shipping service.

[.instruction]
Creating a shipping profile:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Shipping profiles* tab.
. Click on *New* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Select the shipping service provider that you just created from the drop-down list.
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-basic-settings-shipping-profile>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The *Table of shipping charges* tab appears.

|Enter an internal name for the shipping profile. The name is only displayed in your system. It is _not_ visible for customers in the online shop.

| *Flag*
|Select a flag from the drop-down list that is shown in the order overview. The flag indicates which shipping profile is saved at a glance.

| *Priority*
|Select the priority from the drop-down list. The priority determines which shipping profile is displayed first, second, third, etc.

| *Category*
|Select a category from the drop-down list. The category is another way to prioritise shipping profiles in the shopping cart. Category *1* is selected by default. This means that all of the shipping profiles are given the same priority. Further information can be found in the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1300, Tips and tricks: Category>>.

| *Item extra shipping charge*
|Place a check mark to activate the item extra shipping charge that are saved in the item data record. Up to 2 extra shipping charges can be saved for the item's main variation in the *Shipping* area. *Extra shipping charge 1* is added to the shipping costs for the first item. *Extra shipping charge 2* is added to the shipping costs for all additional items. Extra shipping charges are useful for large or bulky items that are particularly expensive to ship. +
Further information can be found in the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1100, Tips and tricks: Extra shipping charges>>.

| *PostIdent*
|PostIdent is the authority verification by the Deutsche Post AG. It serves to verify customers, e.g. in connection with the proof of age for 18+ items. If you want to activate this option, place a check mark. +
*_Note:_* Items with an 18+ age rating have to be linked to a shipping profile that the PostIdent option was activated for.

| *Activate for new items*
|Select the option if you want the shipping profile to automatically be assigned to new items. +

*_Note:_* This setting only applies when you manually create items, but _not_ via REST or import.

| *Cash on delivery*
|Select the option. This allows your customers to select the payment method _Cash on delivery_ in your plentyShop. +

| *Transfer email and telephone number*
|Select whether the email address and the telephone number should be transferred to the shipping service provider or not or whether an alternative value should be transferred. +
*_Note:_* By default, this data is _not_ transferred to the service provider (GDPR conformity).

| *Alternative email*
|This setting is only visible if the option *Transfer alternative* was selected in the drop-down list *Transfer email and telephone number*. Enter an alternative email address that should be transferred to the service provider.

| *Alternative telephone number*
|This setting is only visible if the option *Transfer alternative* was selected in the drop-down list *Transfer email and telephone number*. Enter an alternative telephone number that should be transferred to the service provider.

| *Extra charge for islands*
|Many shipping service providers charge a higher fee when shipping to island regions. You as seller should not be left with these costs. Therefore, open each shipping profile and define a surcharge that is added when shipping to island regions. Postcodes for island regions are saved in the system. The order is automatically synchronised. If you activated the extra charge for islands, this charge is only calculated if the system recognises this postcode as an island region. +
The island surcharge applies for each item when using the calculation type *Item shipping charge*. +
Would you like to know which island regions are saved on the system side in your plentymarkets system? Have a look at the <<#list-postcodes-island-regions, list of postcodes for island regions>> in the expandable box below this table.

|Select one or several of the options to determine possible order referrers for this shipping profile. Alternatively, select *ALL* if you want to activate all referrers.

| *Blocked payment methods*
|Select all the payment methods that should _not_ be offered for the shipping profile. If you have shipping profiles that should not include a cash on delivery option, make sure to select all of the options that are used in connection with cash on delivery.

|Block one or more customer classes for the shipping profile by placing a check mark.

| *Shipping groups*
|If you want to create groups for your shipping profiles, enter a name for a shipping group here and click on *Add*. Enter this name into every shipping profile that should belong to this group. You end up with various groups which contain different shipping profiles. +
*_Example:_* Shipping group A contains the shipping profiles 1 and 2. Shipping group B contains the shipping profiles 3 and 4. If you want to assign an item to shipping profiles 3 and 4, open the item and select shipping group B from the drop-down list in the item's *Global* tab in the *Shipping profiles* area. +
This function allows you to easily and quickly assign the shipping profile to new items.

| *Shipping identification*
|This field is currently without any function.

| *Last change*
|The date of the last change of the shipping profile is shown here.

2+|eBay

| *Account*
|Select one or more eBay accounts or select the option *ALL*. +
*_Important:_* You need to have set up at least 2 accounts, otherwise this option is not visible. Further information can be found in the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1200, Tips and tricks: Shipping costs for orders placed on eBay>>.

| *Listing type*
|Decide which eBay listing type you want to activate this shipping profile for.

2+|Further options

| *Loyalty program*
|Select one or more loyalty programs. You can use the loyalty programs with <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#6600, eBay Plus>> or <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#4200, Amazon>>. +
*_Important:_* If you select a loyalty program for a shipping profile, you can only use the shipping profile for the market. It is not possible to use the shipping profile for the online shop. If, for example, the *eBay Plus* option is activated in a shipping profile, the shipping profile is only used for *eBay Plus* orders. Therefore, create an extra shipping profile that you only use for the loyalty program.

[TIP]
.Default shipping profile cannot be deleted
====
When you defined a default shipping profile in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Orders* menu, the button to delete this shipping profile from the shipping profile overview in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping profiles* menu is disabled. Thus, it is not possible to delete the shipping profile that is saved as default shipping profile.

=== Tips and tricks: Extra shipping charges

The following partial amounts are added together if an order includes items with extra shipping charges:

* The shipping costs that were entered into the shipping profile (basic shipping charge)
* The extra shipping charge 1 for the item with the highest extra shipping charge
* The extra shipping charge 2 for each additional item

[discrete]
==== Example: Adding extra shipping charges for different items

In this example, a customer orders 2 PCs and 2 monitors. The following shipping costs are saved for the items:

*Item 1: PC*

* Basic shipping charge (shipping profile) = EUR 3.99
* Extra shipping charge 1 = EUR 5.00
* Extra shipping charge 2 = EUR 3.00

*Item 2: Monitor*

* Basic shipping charge (shipping profile) = EUR 3.99
* Extra shipping charge 1 = EUR 4.00
* Extra shipping charge 2 = EUR 2.00

The following shipping costs are calculated for the order:

* EUR 3.99 (basic shipping charge) + EUR 5.00 (PC: extra shipping charge 1) + EUR 3.00 (PC: extra shipping charge 2) + EUR 2.00 (Monitor: extra shipping charge 2) + EUR 2.00 (Monitor: extra shipping charge 2) = EUR 15.99

[discrete]
==== Example: Extra shipping charges for multiple copies of the same item

In this example, a customer orders 1 PC, then 2 PCs and then 3 PCs. The following shipping costs are saved for the item:

*Item 1: PC*

* Basic shipping charge (shipping profile) = EUR 3.99
* Extra shipping charge 1 = EUR 5.00
* Extra shipping charge 2 = EUR 3.00

The following shipping costs are calculated for the order:

* Order with 1 PC: EUR 3.99 (basic shipping charge) + EUR 5.00 (extra shipping charge 1) = EUR 8.99
* Order with 2 PCs: EUR 3.99 (basic shipping charge) + EUR 5.00 (extra shipping charge 1) + EUR 3.00 (extra shipping charge 2) = EUR 11.99
* Order with 3 PCs: EUR 3.99 (basic shipping charge) + EUR 5.00 (extra shipping charge 1) + EUR 3.00 (extra shipping charge 2) + EUR 3.00 (extra shipping charge 2) = EUR 14.99

[TIP]
.Calculating shipping costs with extra charges only
====
You can use the *Extra shipping charge* function to let the system calculate your shipping costs exclusively on the basis of ordered items. This is done by entering the shipping costs for each item into the item data record and setting all of the shipping prices to *zero* in the shipping profile.
====

[#1200]
=== Tips and tricks: Shipping costs for orders placed on eBay

Set up the shipping costs for orders placed on eBay in the *Setup » Listings » Checkout* menu. To do so, select *Transfer from eBay* or *Have it calculated by plentymarkets* under the option *Shipping costs for new orders coming from eBay*.

If shipping costs should be calculated differently for eBay than they are for orders coming from the online shop, a separate shipping profile has to be created for them. In this shipping profile, select *eBay* only under the option *Order referrer*. This shipping profile has to be activated for every item that you want the setting to apply to. Thus, at least 2 shipping profiles are activated for these items: One is the shipping profile that contains the "normal" shipping costs and the other one is the shipping profile that contains the shipping costs for eBay.

[IMPORTANT]
.Own shipping profile per eBay account
====
If you activated several eBay accounts in your plentymarkets system, you can define an individual shipping profile for each eBay account. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and use the option *eBay account* in the *Shipping profiles* tab and there in the *Base* tab to select one of the different accounts.
====

[#1300]
=== Tips and tricks: Category

The category option is another way to prioritise shipping profiles. You can use this option to decide which shipping profiles should be displayed in the shopping cart. Category *1* is selected by default. This means that all of the shipping profiles are given the same priority.

The following rules apply:

* The shipping profile with the lowest category is always displayed.
* For multiple items, the common shipping profile with the lowest category is displayed.
* If the items do not have a common shipping profile, the shipping profile with the lowest category is selected.

[TIP]
."Creating a "replacement shipping profile"
====
Create a shipping profile that has a higher category level than the other shipping profiles. This so called "replacement shipping profile" is only chosen if none of the others apply or if they cannot be chosen.
====

[discrete]
==== Example: Selling 18+ items together with other items

You can use categories to sell items that have the shipping profile *delivery to addressee only* (e.g. items released for age 18 and older) together with other items. This is solved as follows:

*Item A*

* Shipping profile 1 (category 1)
* Shipping profile 2 (category 2)

*Item B* (18+ item)

* Shipping profile 2 (category 2)
* Shipping profile 3 (category 5)

If item A is bought alone, shipping profile 2 is not displayed because a shipping profile is available that has a lower category. If both items are bought together, shipping profile 2 has the lowest common category and is therefore the only profile that is displayed.

[#1400]
=== Tips and tricks: Shipping profile combinations that can cause errors

Make sure that all items that can be bought together have at least one common shipping profile. If there are 2 or more items in the shopping cart which do not have a common shipping profile, the shipping profile calculation takes place and the shipping charges are added together for the profiles. However, only the shipping service provider with the higher priority is displayed in the shopping cart. Shipping profiles should not be combined in this way. Such combinations cause errors to occur.

You can avoid such errors, e.g. by activating a DHL shipping profile for all items and only activating an additional shipping profile for selected items.

[discrete]
==== Example: No common shipping profile

There are 2 items in the shopping cart which do not have a common shipping profile.

*Item A*

* DPD shipping profile
* Flat rate shipping charge of EUR 3.95

*Item B*

* DHL shipping profile
* Flat rate shipping charge of EUR 2.95

The priority determines the order in which shipping profiles are displayed in the checkout process in your online shop. The customer sees a total shipping charge of EUR 6.90. However, the customer only sees the shipping service provider with the higher priority in the shopping cart.

[WARNING]
.Error message in the checkout if shipping profile combinations are incompletely calculated
====
If multiple items are to be sent that do not have a common shipping profile, the system calculates the shipping profile combination.

If for at least one of the items no shipping profile can be assigned due to filters and limitations set (e.g. blocked payment methods), the shipping profile combination is incomplete and will be rejected.

In this case, your customers will see the error code 53 (error in the shipping cost calculation) during the checkout and no shipping profile will be selected automatically.

*_Important:_* If you set up shipping profiles with several filters and limitations, such as blocked payment methods, check these shipping profiles and adapt them, if necessary.

The error message as well as the translation of error code 53 can be adjusted for the plentyShop LTS plugin. To do so, go to *CMS » Multilingualism*, expand the *Notifications* area and enter the translation in the line *notificationsCalculatedShippingFailed*.

Adapt the error code also in the *Setup » Client » Global » Language packages* menu in the *Error messages* area, if necessary.

[#1600]
== Selecting a calculation type in the table of shipping charges

Calculation types in the *Table of shipping charges* tab are different ways to calculate shipping costs for items. For example, you can calculate shipping costs based on an item's weight or volume or based on the number of items that are purchased. You can select a different calculation type for each region. All of the different calculation types are explained in the section below. <<#table-settings-calculation-types>> contains notes that apply to the calculation types in general.

[[table-settings-calculation-types]]
.General settings of the calculation types
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Maximum values*
|If the maximum saved value (volume, weight, price, quantity) is exceeded, no shipping costs can be calculated. Therefore, the maximum should always be high enough.

| *Flat rates*
|A flat-rate shipping charge can be defined starting from a particular value of items. If the order reaches or exceeds this value of items, the flat-rate shipping charge is used for the calculation. These flat rates take priority over the values saved for weights, volumes or quantities.

| *Limitations*
|Limitations allow you to specify minimum and maximum values for each shipping profile. If an order does not meet or exceeds these values, it is not possible to use the shipping profile for this order. You can create another shipping profile as an alternative, e.g. a profile for a different shipping service provider. It should have values that go beyond the limitations.
|====

[discrete]
=== Calculation type: Flat rate

This calculation type treats shipping costs as total prices. In other words, regardless how many items a customer purchases, they only pay the shipping costs entered here.

In this case, it would be wise to set up an extra shipping charge for each additional item. You can do so by saving <<item/managing-items#290, extra shipping charges>> within the items' *Shipping* area and by activating the *Item extra shipping charge* option in the *Base* tab of the shipping profile.

[discrete]
=== Calculation type: Weight-dependent

If you select the calculation type *Weight-dependent*, enter the maximum gross weight in grams into the column *Maximum (g)*. Enter the corresponding shipping costs into the column *Amount (EUR)*. This way, you create a sliding scale of shipping costs according to weight. Click on *Add* to add further graduated prices.

[discrete]
=== Calculation type: Volume-dependent

If you select the calculation type *Volume-dependent*, enter the maximum volume in cubic metres into the column *Maximum (cubic metres)*. Enter the corresponding shipping costs into the column *Amount (EUR)*. This way, you create a sliding scale of shipping costs according to the item's volume. Click on *Add* to add further graduated prices.

[WARNING]
.Dimensions have to be saved for the item
====
The volume is only calculated correctly if you saved the item's length, width and height within the main variation's *Settings* tab in the <<item/managing-items#270, Dimensions>> area in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item]* menu. It is not possible to calculate the volume if these entries are missing. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the shipping costs based on the volume either.
====

[discrete]
=== Calculation type: Quantity-dependent

If you select the calculation type *Quantity-dependent*, enter the maximum number of items into the column *Maximum (no.)*. Enter the corresponding shipping costs into the column *Amount (EUR)*. This way, you create a sliding scale of shipping costs according to the number of items. Click on *Add* to add further graduated prices.

[discrete]
=== Calculation type: Price-dependent

If you select the calculation type *Price-dependent*, enter the maximum order total into the column *Maximum (EUR)* and the corresponding shipping costs into the column *Amount (EUR)*. This way, you create a sliding scale of shipping costs according to the value of a particular item. If all of the items use the same shipping profile, you have a sliding scale for the total price of an entire order.

[discrete]
=== Calculation type: Item shipping charge

If you select the calculation type *Item shipping charge*, the shipping costs depend on the number of items. Depending on which amount you enter in the field *Each additional item*, the shipping costs for each additional item increase by this amount.

[#1700]
== Calculating the shipping costs

In the *Calculate shipping costs* tab, you can configure the shipping costs that are needed for exporting items to price comparison portals. The general shipping profiles are not used for price comparison portals. Configure settings that are appropriate for all of the items that are exported to price comparison portals. If these settings are not configured, the shipping costs are exported incorrectly or they are exported with the entry "0".

For further information, refer to the <<data/exporting-data/FormatDesigner/format-types/orders#, FormatDesigner>> page of the manual.

Select the most general default referrer possible, e.g. *Client (store)*. Select a standard shipping region that includes all of the countries of delivery for the items that you want to export.

[TIP]
.Cash in advance payment method
====
Be sure to select the payment method *Cash in advance* from one of the drop-down lists to allow that this payment method can be used as an alternative in case the other payment methods are rejected.
====

[.instruction]
Calculating the shipping costs:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Calculate shipping costs* tab.
. Select the *default referrer*, *default shipping region*, *payment method 1* and *payment method 2* for both configurations.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#1800]
== Activating the shipping profile

You are not able to ship an item with a specific shipping profile until you open the item data record and activate the profile. Activate at least one shipping profile per item. Otherwise, the shipping costs may not be calculated correctly.

[.instruction]
Activating the shipping profile:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item which you want to activate the shipping profile for.
. Click on the *Global* tab.
. Activate the shipping profile.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Default shipping profile
====
If an order contains items for which no shipping profile was activated, the items are given the default shipping profile of your plentyShop. The <<online-store/setting-up-ceres#260, standard shipping profile>> can be selected in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Orders* menu. If no default shipping profile was specified, the shipping profile with the highest priority is used.
====

[#1900]
== Creating a shipping package

In the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Shipping packages* menu, you create shipping packages for your shipping processes. You can set up shipping packages with clearly defined dimensions or you can let your plentymarkets system automatically define the size based on the item data. A standard package is automatically assigned if you do not create a shipping package and assign it to an order. The volume of the standard package is calculated based on the item data.

[TIP]
.Examples: Defined shipping packages and flexible packaging
====
_Defined shipping packages:_ A seller ships their items in 2 different cardboard box sizes. Therefore, they need to set up 2 shipping packages. The volume of these packages results from the dimensions entered and saved. +
Shipping package 1: 30 cm x 25 cm x 40 cm +
Shipping package 2: 50 cm x 50 cm x 25 cm

_Individual packaging:_ In order to ship e.g. furniture, the seller uses packaging material that is individually cut to match the size of the item to be shipped. These materials can be corrugated card board, foil etc. The volume is calculated based on the item data.
====

Proceed as described below to create a shipping package.

[.instruction]
Creating a shipping package:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Shipping packages*.
. Click on the *New Shipping package* tab.
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-create-shipping-package>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-create-shipping-package]]
.Creating a shipping package
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Name*
|Enter a name for the shipping package.

| *Volume*
| Select *take from the shipping package* (length, width, height) or *take from the item data (total)*. +
If you select the option *take from the item data (total)*, the lines *Length*, *Width* and *Height* are no longer visible.

| *Length*, *Width*, *Height*
|Enter the values for the dimensions of the shipping package and pay attention to the unit.

| *Unit*
|Select the unit from the drop-down list.

| *Maximum weight (KG)*
|Enter the maximum weight in kilograms. +
*_Note:_* If this weight is exceeded, the shipping package with the lowest ID is used. The settings in this shipping package have no further impact because it is the standard package in your system. +
*_Example:_* 2 shipping packages are set up in your system: Shipping package A with the lowest ID and no further settings as well as shipping package B with a maximum permissible weight of 10 kg. If an order with a weight of 12 kg is now coming into the system, shipping package B does not apply any longer and shipping package A is used.

| *Maximum volume (total)*
|Enter the maximum volume in cubic metres. +
*_Note:_* This value refers to the total volume of the shipping package and is the sum of the volumes of the items contained in it. This number gives you an idea of whether or not the items of an order fit into the shipping package.

| *Client (store)*
|Select a client (shop) from the drop-down list. Select the option *ALL* if you wish to make the shipping package available for all online shops.
|====

How you edit, add or delete shipping packages is described on the <<fulfilment/shipping-centre#, Using the shipping centre>> page of the manual.

[#2300]
== Controlling shipping processes

<<automation/processes/setting-up-processes#, Processes>> are a tool that you can use to manage all of your shipping processes. It is possible to set up and customise very specific processes and carry out these processes automatically. For example, you can use the procedures <<automation/processes/procedures#340, Polling>>, <<automation/processes/procedures#380, Return label>>, <<automation/processes/procedures#390, Return slip>> and <<automation/processes/procedures#430, Shipping centre>> to process your shipments.

[#2400]
== Viewing the log

=== Setting up a warehouse

You need to have a warehouse in order to save the information about returns that you receive from DHL. There are various types of warehouses in plentymarkets. The warehouse type *Repair* is especially well-suited for returns. The setting *Warehouse assigned for repair* in the *Setup » Stock » Warehouse » [Select warehouse] » Settings* menu allows you to assign repair warehouses to main warehouses of the type *Sales* warehouse.

If you have not yet created a warehouse, create a warehouse or a sales and repair warehouse in the *Setup » Stock » Warehouse* menu. How to create a warehouse is described on the <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#, Setting up a warehouse>> page of the manual.

=== Hermes Two-Man Handling

How you set up shipping service providers and shipping profiles and which additional settings you have to carry out and may carry out, is described in the chapters from <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#100, Setting up countries of delivery>> through <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#2400, Retrieving the log>>. The settings described there are the basic requirements in order to carry out the settings that are specific for each shipping service provider. Therefore, first carry out the settings in the chapters mentioned above. Afterwards, continue with this chapter.

During the order process, customers should be able to request that their items are assembled for them. You can offer customers such a service with link:https://www.hermesworld.com/en/about-us/hermes-group/hermes-einrichtungs-service/[Hermes Two-Man Handling^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. In order to use this service, create an order characteristic. Create an order characteristic with the options *Yes* and *No*. Depending on which *Characteristic type* you select, you are able to configure the options that your customers later selects in your online shop.

[TIP]
.Interface for existing customers only
====
The interface to Hermes Two-Man Handling can only be used by existing customers. New customers are asked to contact link:https://www.hermesworld.com/de/unsere-dienstleistungen/distribution/2-mann-handling/2-mann-handling/[Hermes Einrichtungs Service GmbH & Co.KG^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

====
The order characteristic is linked to the item and not to the shipping service provider.

== Overview of fulfilment service providers

In plentymarkets, sellers can entrust their logistics processes to external service providers who manage all or part of the stock and report the status back to your plentymarkets system. These service providers also ship the item to your customers. In plentymarkets you can also organise the storage of items in your own warehouses and the shipping via different service providers.

<<#table-overview-fulfilment-service-providers>> lists all of the fulfilment service providers available in plentymarkets. Click on the service provider in the table to jump to the sub-chapter or the page where the specific settings of the service provider are described.

=== DHL Fulfillment

Set up link:https://www.dhl.de/en/geschaeftskunden/paket/leistungen-und-services/fulfillment.html[DHL Fulfilment^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] in your plentymarkets system. To do so, proceed as described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Klarna orders are not transferred to DHL Fulfillment
====
Currently, it is not possible to transfer orders that are paid with <<payment/klarna#, Klarna>> to DHL Fulfillment. Only orders with a valid invoice can be transferred to DHL Fulfillment. However, Klarna only transmits the invoice to plentymarkets after outgoing items are booked.
====

Registering the shipment with DHL Fulfillment takes place automatically via the interface. The *Data » Log* menu contains information about shipments that were registered with DHL Fulfillment. For further information about the log, refer to the <<data/datalog#, Data log>> page of the manual.

[#4850]
==== Requirements for the item transfer to DHL Fulfillment

The following requirements must be met to ensure that the variation is correctly transferred to DHL Fulfillment:

* The variation is active.
* A valid sales warehouse of the type *DHL Fulfillment* is selected as main warehouse of the variation.
* The variation has not been previously transferred to DHL Fulfillment.
* The variation has a sales price that is activated for the currency *Euro* and the referrer *WEB API*. The price at the variation can also be EUR 0.00. However, a sales price has to be active.

[#4870]
==== Creating a shipping service provider and a shipping profile for DHL Fulfillment

In order that the services are correctly processed, it is important that you create the shipping service provider *DHL Fulfillment*. To do so, go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and click on the *Shipping service provider* tab. Further information can be found in the chapter <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800, Creating a shipping service provider>>.

Afterwards, you create a shipping profile for DHL Fulfillment. Carry out the settings as described in the <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, Creating a shipping profile>> chapter.

Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Options* and click on the *Shipping profiles* tab. In the *Table of shipping charges* tab of DHL Fulfillment shipping profile in the *DHL Fulfillment* area, you can select the options Germany, United Kingdom or France from the drop-down list *DHL Fulfillment region*.

[#4900]
==== Creating a warehouse

First, go to *Setup » Stock » Warehouse* and create warehouses for the items processed by DHL Fulfillment. Select the *logistics type* DHL Fulfillment for all warehouses. Select these warehouses as the main warehouses for items that are processed by DHL Fulfillment. To do so, go to *Item » Edit item*, open the item and select the main warehouse in the *Shipping* area. For further information about creating warehouses, refer to the <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#, Setting up a warehouse>> page of the manual.

Create the following warehouse types to set up DHL Fulfillment:

* *Sales*
* *Storage*
* *Repair*
* *Other*

[TIP]
.Selection of multiple sales warehouses possible
====
Currently, it is possible to select the following DHL Fulfillment subsidiaries:

* Staufenberg
* Langenfeld
* Braunschweig
* Göttingen
* Kirchheim
* Oud-Gastel
* Radlett
* Nieuwegein
* Derendingen
* Wissous
* Rosersberg

Make sure to use correct spelling of the subsidiaries in the *Town* field of the warehouse settings. This will ensure that the orders are transferred to the correct subsidiary.

If you do not work with multiple DHL Fulfillment subsidiaries, it is not necessary to enter one of these towns.
====

In order for the DHL Fulfillment interface to work correctly, you need at least one warehouse of the type *Sales* with *DHL Fulfillment* as the logistics type. You can create up to 4 warehouses. DHL assigns the warehouses according to the stock types that they use. For example, DHL assigns stock of the stock type *Prime Selection* to the sales warehouse. These items are meant to be sold directly. Items with the stock type *Second Quality* are not meant to be sold and need a separate warehouse, e.g. the *Storage* warehouse. If these items were checked and are able to be sold, they are assigned to the stock type *Prime Selection* and moved to the Sales warehouse.

[WARNING]
.Warehouse assignment by DHL
====
DHL assigns stock to the warehouses that you created for DHL Fulfillment. Do not change any of the stocks that are intended for DHL Fulfillment.

DHL Fulfillment uses the following stock types:

* *Prime Selection*: First choice, items are intended for sale. Assignment to sales warehouse.
* *Second Quality*: Second choice, items are _not_ intended for sale. Assignment to storage warehouse.
* *Damaged*: Damaged items that are not intended for sale. Assignment to repair warehouse.
* *Blocked* and *Clearing*: Blocked items and items that need to be checked, not intended for sale. Assignment to special warehouse (warehouse type *Other*).
* *Missing*: Items can currently not be found. Assignment to special warehouse (warehouse type *Other*).
* *Expired*: Items are expired. Assignment to special warehouse (warehouse type *Other*).
* *Separated*: Items are separated, this status is currently without function. Assignment to special warehouse (warehouse type *Other*).
* *Refurbishment*: Refurbished items. Assignment to special warehouse (warehouse type *Other*).
* *Cross_Selection*: This status is currently not in use. Assignment to special warehouse (warehouse type *Other*).

Damaged items can be returns but also items that were damaged while being moved within the warehouse or that were already damaged when they were delivered.

If you create reorders for your items in the *Stock » Reorder management » Reorders* menu, make sure that the reorder is in *Status [2] Confirmed*. Only if the reorder is in this status can it be transmitted to DHL Fulfillment. For further information about reorders, refer to the <<stock-management/managing-reorders#, Managing reorders>> page of the manual.

Note that your plentymarkets system is only able to adapt changes to stock if the item data has been transmitted to DHL Fulfillment via plentymarkets. It is important that DHL Fulfillment has confirmed the items in order that these items can be taken into account.

[#5000]
==== Creating order statuses

Go to *Setup » Orders » Order status* and set up 2 <<orders/managing-orders#1200, order statuses>> for the orders transferred to DHL Fulfillment. In the following, you find 2 examples:

* [6.5] Currently being shipped by fulfilment service provider +
→ For correctly registered orders

* [5.6] Error with fulfilment service provider +
→ For orders which could not be processed by DHL Fulfillment because of incorrect order details. Example: Item master data was not yet transferred to DHL Fulfillment.

[TIP]
.Orders in status 5.x
====
An order is automatically transferred to DHL Fulfillment if the order is in *status 5.x* and an invoice was created for the order. The transfer interval is about every 15 minutes. The only exception is the order status that is used for the option *Order status in case of error*. Orders are not transferred to DHL Fulfillment if they are in this status.

The *Data » Log* menu contains information about shipments that were registered with DHL Fulfillment. For further information about the log, refer to the <<data/datalog#, Data log>> page of the manual.
====

If you want to create a specific workflow for processing DHL Fulfillment orders, you should also create another status, e.g. *5.4 Preparation for fulfilment service provider* to separate DHL Fulfillment orders from other orders even before they are transferred to DHL.

[#5100]
==== Creating reasons for returns

If you want returns from DHL Fulfillment to be imported into your plentymarkets system, you need to create reasons for the returns. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order types » Return* to create <<orders/managing-orders#410, reasons for returns>>. Afterwards, link the reasons that you created with the reasons given by DHL Fulfillment in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Fulfilment service provider » DHL Fulfillment* menu.

==== Transferring characteristics

Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics* and create a characteristic of the type *Selection*. Transfer item characteristics such as _Fragile_ or _Original packaging_ to DHL Fulfillment if you want items to be handled or shipped in a certain way. For further information, refer to the <<item/settings/properties#300, Characteristics and properties>> page. The following characteristics can be transferred to DHL Fulfillment:

* *Expiration date*: The item is stored in the DHL Fulfillment warehouse with a mandatory expiration date. When recording new incoming items, DHL Fulfillment also records an expiration date for items that have this characteristic.
* *Original packaging*: The item is shipped individually by DHL Fulfillment in its original packaging.
* *Fragile*: DHL Fulfillment uses additional packaging materials while the item is boxed up.
* *Serial number*: The serial number is scanned while the item is boxed up. DHL Fulfillment transmits this serial number to plentymarkets along with the shipping confirmation. This way, the serial number can be printed on the invoice and can be used by customers (e.g. for documentation, coupons).

[IMPORTANT]
.Selecting the correct characteristic type for the characteristics
====
Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics* and create the following 3 characteristics of the type *None*:

* *Expiration date*
* *Original packaging*
* *Fragile*

Create the characteristic *Serial number* with the characteristic type *Selection* and save the following 3 values:

* *SN* (Used for scanning an item's serial numbers)
* *SNK* (Used for scanning ranges of serial numbers per item)
* *SNK2* (Used for scanning ranges of serial numbers per order item)

For further information, refer to the <<item/managing-items#80, Activating characteristics>> chapter on the <<item/managing-items#, Manually creating items>> page of the manual.
====

After you created the characteristics, <<item/managing-items#80, activate>> these characteristics for the item within the item's *Characteristics* tab. Finally, go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Fulfilment » DHL Fulfillment* and use the drop-down lists to select the characteristics that you created.

===== Transferring orders to DHL Fulfillment

Before transmitting the order to DHL Fulfillment, the recipient's address is checked with respect to a valid form and structure; i.e. plentymarkets checks for example if all mandatory fields such as the name are filled out. +
If the address contains faulty HTML signs and/or invalid signs that are not accepted by the API, these signs are corrected. If, however, the address contains an error that cannot be corrected, the order is not transmitted. This prevents a disturbance within the process because DHL Fulfillment cannot retrieve invalid and/or faulty XML files from the FTP server.

Note that creating an invoice in advance is mandatory for orders where the delivery address is located in a non-EU country. For orders that are sent to a EU member state, you do _not_ have to create an invoice.

[#5310]

Afterwards select the region *Germany*, the shipping product for national or international shipment and activate the shipping services in the table of shipping charges. These services are only visible in the table of shipping charges after you saved the settings in the shipping profile.
