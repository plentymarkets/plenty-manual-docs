[#set-up-postnl]
== Setting up PostNL in plentymarkets

[TIP]
.Simply setting up PostNL with the help of an assistant
====
You need a plugin to link plentymarkets to PostNL. Visit the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/postnl_7014[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] to download the PostNL plugin. +
The PostNL assistant that allow an easy setup is then available in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins* menu in the relevant plugin set.

Before completing the PostNL assistant, you need to complete the *Shipping settings* assistant. This assistant is available in your plentymarkets system by default. You can find it in the *Setup » Assistants » Integration* menu. With this assistant, carry out the following settings:

* determine a name for the shipping setting (i.e. the shipping profile)
* activate existing regions or create a new region
* determine the shipping costs and select the calculation type
* *_Note:_* Afterwards, go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and click on the *Shipping profiles* tab to carry out further settings for the shipping profile. Further information on these settings are provided below on this manual page.

Afterwards, complete the PostNL assistant.
====

[#preparatory-settings]
== Carrying out the preparatory settings

First, you have to carry out some preparatory settings in the plentymarkets back end:

* <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#100, Set up countries of delivery>>

** You can set up the countries of delivery in the *Shipping settings* assistant or in the back end.

* <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#400, Create regions>>
** You can create regions in the *Shipping settings* assistant or in the back end.

* <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800, Creating the shipping service provider>> *PostNL*
** Currently, you can create shipping service providers only in the back end and _not_ in an assistant.

* Create a <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, shipping profile>> and the <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1500, table of shipping charges>> for *PostNL* +
** You can set up some of the shipping settings in the *Shipping settings* assistant. The remaining settings have to be carried out in the back end in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* menu in the *Shipping profiles* tab. +
icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] *_Important:_* Not all functions and settings have been transferred from the shipping profile to the *Shipping settings* assistant yet. Note the explanations in the <<#assistant-shipping-settings, Completing the *Shipping settings* assistant>> chapter.

[#complete-assistant]
== Completing the assistants

Once you have <<plugins/installing-added-plugins#installing-plugins, installed the plugin in a plugin set>>, the PostNL assistant is visible in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins* menu in the relevant plugin set and you can start with the setup. The *Shipping settings* assistant is available in your plentymarkets system by default. You can find it in the *Setup » Assistants » Integration* menu.

Now complete the assistants in the following order:

1. *Shipping settings*
2. *PostNL*

[#assistant-shipping-settings]
=== Completing the *Shipping settings* assistant

You find the *Shipping settings* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Integration* menu. In this assistant, carry out the following settings:

* Enter a back end and a front end name for the shipping setting. These names can be selected per language. +
 ** Link this name later in the *PostNL* assistant.

* Select the plugin of the shipping service provider for which you want to set up shipping costs. +
 ** You have to download the PostNL plugin in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/postnl_7014[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] before you can see it here.

* Select a region, enter the shipping costs and select the calculation type for the selected countries. Furthermore, you can determine the value of items from which no shipping costs will be calculated.

[IMPORTANT]
.Carry out further settings for the shipping settings in the back end
====
If you have completed the *Shipping settings* assistant, the shipping profile also appears in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* menu in the *Shipping profile* tab. +
The following settings are available once the assistant has been completed:

* the name of the shipping profile is saved
* the shipping service provider is saved
* the option *Activate for new items* is activated
* all clients (shops) are activated
* all order referrers are activated
* the shipping costs are saved
* the region is saved

If you want to carry out further settings such as blocking customer classes or payment methods or activating the option for the agreement upon data transmission to shipping service providers, you have to go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and carry out these settings in the *Shipping profiles* tab in the corresponding shipping profile.

icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] This workaround is still necessary because not all functions and settings have been transferred from the shipping profile to the assistant yet. We will implement the missing settings in the assistant step by step.
