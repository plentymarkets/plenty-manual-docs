[IMPORTANT]
.Installing the DHL Shipping (Versenden) plugin with the help of the Integrations assistant
====
You need a plugin to link plentymarkets to DHL Shipping (Versenden). Complete the *Integrations* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » First steps* menu to easily and quickly install the DHL Shipping (Versenden) plugin. +
As an alternative, you can download the plugin from link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/dhlshipping_4871[plentyMarketplace^].
====

[#register-with-dhl]
== Registering with DHL

In order to set up the interface for DHL Shipping (Versenden) in your plentymarkets system and use the function _Versenden_ (shipping) in the DHL business customer portal, you have to be registered with link:http://www.dhl.de/dhl-kundewerden?source=plentymarkets&cid=c_dhloka_de_plentymarkets[DHL^]. You receive the data from DHL that you need for the settings in plentymarkets.

== Setting up DHL Shipping (Versenden) in plentymarkets

[TIP]
.Simply setting up DHL Shipping (Versenden) with the help of assistants
====
You need a plugin to link plentymarkets to DHL Shipping (Versenden). In order to use this interface, you need the DHL Shipping (Versenden) plugin. Complete the *Integrations* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » First steps* menu to easily and quickly install the DHL Shipping (Versenden) plugin. +
As an alternative, you can download the plugin from link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/dhlshipping_4871[plentyMarketplace^]. +
After successful installation, two DHL Shipping assistants that allow an easy setup are available in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins* menu in the relevant plugin set.

Before completing the two DHL Shipping assistants, you need to complete the *Shipping settings* assistant. This assistant is available in your plentymarkets system by default. You can find it in the *Setup » Assistants » Integration* menu. With this assistant, carry out the following settings:

* determine a name for the shipping setting (i.e. the shipping profile)
* activate existing regions or create a new region
* determine the shipping costs and select the calculation type
* *_Note:_* Afterwards, go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and click on the *Shipping profiles* tab to carry out further settings for the shipping profile. Further information on these settings are provided below on this manual page.

Afterwards, complete the two DHL Shipping assistants:

* DHL Shipping: Basic settings
 ** In this assistant, you prepare all the data that you later need in the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant.
* DHL Shipping: Settings combination +
 ** In this assistant, link the settings that you saved in the *Shipping settings* and *DHL Shipping: Basic settings* assistants and select the product and the appropriate services.
====

Further down on this page, it is described which data you need to enter in the assistants.

[#preparatory-settings]
== Carrying out the preparatory settings

First, you have to carry out some preparatory settings in the plentymarkets back end:

* xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#100[Set up countries of delivery]

** You can set up the countries of delivery in the *Shipping settings* assistant or in the back end.

* xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#400[Create regions]
** You can create regions in the *Shipping settings* assistant or in the back end.

* create the xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#800[shipping service provider] *DHL Shipping (Versenden)*
** Currently, you can create the shipping service provider only in the back end and not in an assistant.

* create a xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1000[shipping profile] and the xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1500[table of shipping charges] for *DHL Shipping (Versenden)* +
** You can set up some of the shipping settings in the *Shipping settings* assistant. The remaining settings have to be carried out in the back end in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* menu in the *Shipping profiles* tab. +
icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] *_Important:_* Not all functions and settings have been transferred from the shipping profile to the *Shipping settings* assistant yet. Note the explanations in the <<#assistant-shipping-settings, Completing the *Shipping settings* assistant>> chapter.

[#complete-dhl-assistants]
== Completing the assistants

As soon as you have installed the *DHL Shipping (Versenden)* plugin in a plugin set with the help of the *Integrations* assistant, the *DHL Shipping: Basic settings* and the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistants are available in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins* menu in the relevant plugin set. +
The *Shipping settings* assistant is available in your plentymarkets system by default. You can find it in the *Setup » Assistants » Integration* menu.

Now complete the assistants in the following order:

1. *Shipping settings*
2. *DHL Shipping: Basic settings*
3. *DHL Shipping: Settings combination*

[#assistant-shipping-settings]
=== Completing the *Shipping settings* assistant

You find the *Shipping settings* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Integration* menu. In this assistant, carry out the following settings:

* Enter a back end and a front end name for the shipping setting. These names can be selected per language. +
 ** Link this name later in the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant.

* Select the plugin of the shipping service provider for which you want to set up shipping costs. +
 ** The DHL Shipping (Versenden) plugin has to be installed in order that it is shown here.

* Select a region, enter the shipping costs and select the calculation type for the selected countries. Furthermore, you can determine the value of items from which no shipping costs will be calculated.

[IMPORTANT]
.Carry out further settings for the shipping settings in the back end
====
If you have completed the *Shipping settings* assistant, the shipping profile also appears in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* menu in the *Shipping profile* tab. +
The following settings are available once the assistant has been completed:

* the name of the shipping profile is saved
* the shipping service provider is saved
* the option *Activate for new items* is activated
* all clients (shops) are activated
* all order referrers are activated
* the shipping costs are saved
* the region is saved

If you want to carry out further settings such as blocking customer classes or payment methods or activating the option for the agreement upon data transmission to shipping service providers, you have to go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and carry out these settings in the *Shipping profiles* tab in the corresponding shipping profile.

icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] This workaround is still necessary because not all functions and settings have been transferred from the shipping profile to the assistant yet. We will implement the missing settings in the assistant step by step.

[#dhl-assistant-basic-settings]
=== Completing the *DHL Shipping: Basic settings* assistant

You find the *DHL Shipping: Basic settings* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins* menu in the relevant plugin set. This assistant has several steps to complete. These steps are explained in the following.

[#step-login-details]
==== Login details

In this step, save your login details for the DHL business customer portal. You can save multiple login details when you have multiple clients (shops) and/or concluded more than one contract with DHL. In the second assistant *DHL Shipping: Settings combination*, you can link this data.

[IMPORTANT]
.Deleting linked login details
====
If you want to delete a login again, click on icon:minus-square[role="red"]. Note that the login details can only be successfully deleted in this assistant when they are _no longer_ used in the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant. +
If you linked the login details in the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant and you delete them only here, these login details will still be displayed when you open the assistant again. This means that first you have to remove the link in the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant. Afterwards, you can delete the login details in this assistant.
====

Furthermore, determine for each of your logins whether shipping labels should always be generated, also when shipping orders with non-codable addresses are created, e.g. when the address data is not complete or not available at all. DHL corrects the incorrect data and bills you for this service. Afterwards, the order can be registered successfully.

If the option *Force label generation* is _not_ activated – this means the button is grey (material:toggle_off[role=darkGrey]) –, non-codable shipping orders are rejected by DHL when trying to register them with DHL Versenden and an error message is displayed. The order is not registered and no shipping label is generated in your plentymarkets system.

*_Note:_*

* The login name may not contain any umlauts. Even if a login name with umlauts is accepted by the website, the interface may still reject it.

* The maximum password length is 20 characters. Although DHL technically allows you to use a longer password, you may only use a maximum of 20 characters via the plentymarkets interface. If you use a password that is longer than 20 characters, errors occur.

[#step-shipper-data]
==== Shipper data

In this step, enter your shipper data. The data is shown as sender address on the shipping label. Furthermore, you can show the bank details and polling data by activating the buttons (material:toggle_on[role=skyBlue]).

Do you want to display your company logo on the shipping label? To do so, select the option *Use shipper reference from the DHL business customer portal*. DHL then uses both address data that you saved in the DHL business customer portal and the company logo that you uploaded there. Only the sender reference is transferred to DHL, but _not_ the sender data from plentymarkets.

*_Note:_* If you activate (material:toggle_on[role=skyBlue]) the *Show polling data* button in this step, the *Account reference* and *Sender reference* fields are visible (see <<#image-dhl-shipping-show-polling-data>>). Entering the account reference and the sender reference in this area is only necessary if you register your shipments via the _polling format_. The account reference and the sender reference are _not_ relevant for the transmission via the interface.

[[image-dhl-shipping-show-polling-data]]
.Show polling data
image::fulfilment:dhl-shipping-show-polling-data.png[width=640, height=360]

[#step-billing-number]
==== Billing number

In this step, save your DHL billing number in accordance with your DHL contract.

The DHL billing number consists of 14 digits in total and is composed of 3 components: EKP (customer number), product and subscription. The first 10 digits are the EKP, the 11th and 12th digit are the product and the 13th and 14th digit are the subscription.

*_Example of a DHL billing number:_* `1234567890 53 01`

* `1234567890` is the EKP (customer number)
* `53` is the product _DHL Paket International_
* `01` is the subscription

The following DHL products are available in the assistant:

* 01 - DHL Paket
* 53 - DHL Paket International
* 54 - DHL Europaket
* 55 - DHL Paket Connect
* 62 - DHL Warenpost
* 66 - DHL Warenpost International
* 86 - DHL Paket Austria
* 87 - DHL Paket Connect (Austria)
* 82 - DHL Paket Austria International

<<#dhl-products-services, In this chapter>> you can find all services that correspond to the products.

[#step-reference-label]
==== Reference on label

In this step, you can select the references as they should appear on the shipping label:

* The setting that you select from the drop-down list *Reference per order* will be shown on the shipping label _once_.

* The setting that you select from the drop-down list *Reference per item position* will be shown on the shipping label _per item position_.

*_Note:_* Both selected settings will be shown combined in one field on the label. The maximum number of characters is limited to 35. If the maximum number of characters is exceeded, the reference will be cut off after the last pipe and the sign *»* will be displayed.

You can select the following values for the order data:

* Order ID
* External order ID
* Order ID / External order ID

You can select the following values for the item data:

* Variation number
* Name1
* Variation name
* Variation ID
* External variation ID
* Model

In this step, you can also select whether the number of items per position should be shown on the label and whether the number of packages should be added for this order if it is more than one package.

[#step-summary]
==== Summary

In this step, a summary of all entries that you made in the single steps is listed. You can check the settings, adjust them, if needed, and complete the assistant afterwards.

[#dhl-assistant-settings-combination]
=== Completing the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant

You find the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins* menu in the relevant plugin set.

[#step-settings-combination]
==== Settings combination

In this step, link the settings that you saved in the *Shipping settings* and *DHL Shipping: Basic settings* assistants.

Link the shipping setting with the shipping region, your login details, your shipper address and the DHL billing number and select the <<#dhl-products-services, services based on the product>> and your DHL contract. Note that you may need to contact DHL to obtain additional activation for certain products and services. Further information about the services <<#service-retail-outlet-routing, Retail Outlet Routing>>, <<#service-ident-check, Ident check>> and <<#dhl-warenpost, DHL Warenpost>> can be found further down on this page in the linked chapters.

Check which options you have selected for *Default shipping method* and *Default shipping profile* in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Orders* menu. Adjust the settings, if needed.

[TIP]
If you select a DHL billing number that is used for international shipments, the step *International shipments* automatically appears in the assistant. <<#step-international-shipments, Further down in this chapter>>, it is described which settings you can carry out in this step.

[IMPORTANT]
.DHL Preferred Delivery services only visible after installation of the DHL Preferred Delivery plugin
====
The DHL Preferred Delivery services *Preferred day*, *Preferred location* and *Preferred neighbour* are only available in this area once you have installed the DHL Preferred Delivery plugin with the help of the *Integrations* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » First steps* menu. +
As an alternative, download the plugin from link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/dhlwunschpaket_5435[plentyMarketplace^] and install it in a plugin set. +
Also for the *DHL Preferred Delivery* plugin, there is an assistant available in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins* menu in the relevant plugin set allowing you to simply and quickly set up the services.
====

Furthermore, use the buttons to determine whether your customers can use a finder in your online shop to select the address of a packstation or a post office as delivery address and whether you want to transfer a minimum package weight to DHL to register the order. Furthermore, you can determine that the phone numbers of your customers are neither transmitted to DHL nor displayed on the shipping label.

[#step-international-shipments]
==== International shipments

This step is only visible if you selected a DHL billing number for international shipments in the previous step *Settings combination*.

In this step, determine via the service _Sender's instructions_ how your parcels are handled in case they cannot be delivered in the recipient’s country. Select either the return to sender with costs or the abandonment (auction or disposal) of the parcels without costs. The service _Sender’s instructions_ is mandatory for international shipments.

*Shipment to non-EU countries*

If you ship your parcels to countries that do _not_ belong to the European Union, activate (material:toggle_on[role=skyBlue]) the option *Export delivery*. Two additional fields appear where you can select the franking (see <<#table-franking-incoterms>>) and the type of shipment for export deliveries. These two values are mandatory for export deliveries. +
Note also the information about the CN23 form in the <<#customs-declaration, Customs declaration>> chapter.

[#data-transfer]
== Information about data transfer

If you activated the option *Agreement upon data transfer* in the DHL Shipping (Versenden) shipping profile in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Setting* menu in the *Shipping profiles* tab, a checkbox is visible for your customers in the checkout of your plentyShop. Your customers decide whether they agree that their data is transferred to the shipping service provider or not.

* If the customer agrees that their data is transferred, the email address of the customer is transferred to the shipping service provider.
* If the customer does _not_ agree that their data is transferred, the alternative email address that you entered in the shipping profile is transferred.
* If the customer does _not_ agree that their data is transferred and you did not enter an alternative email address in the shipping profile, an error message is displayed and the order cannot be registered with DHL.

Therefore, it is important that you enter alternative values for the email address and the telephone number in the shipping profile. Otherwise, it is not possible to successfully register the order with DHL when selecting certain services.
*_Note:_* The *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant has an additional setting for the service *Retail Outlet Routing* for <<#service-retail-outlet-routing, transferring the email address>> or an alternative email address.

[IMPORTANT]
.Upload polling file in case of DHL failure
====
If there is a failure of the interface on the part of DHL, it is possible to use the polling format *DHL Shipping (Versenden)* as an alternative. Generate the polling file containing the orders that should be registered either with a process and plentyBase or go to the *Orders » Shipping centre* menu. Afterwards, you can upload this file to the DHL business customer portal via the template *DHL plentymarkets Importformat*. +
Note that the following services _cannot_ be transmitted to DHL via the polling format:

* Return immediately, 2nd attempt of delivery, Verpackungsrücknahme, Unzustellbarkeitsnachricht (when selecting the product 01 - DHL Paket) +
* immediate, after deadline abandonment (when selecting the product 53 - DHL Paket International) +
* DHL Preferred Delivery services
====

[#service-retail-outlet-routing]
== Using the Retail Outlet Routing service

Thanks to the _Retail Outlet Routing_ service your undeliverable item (in case the recipient is unknown) gets a second chance to reach the recipient: Rather than being returned immediately to you, the undeliverable item will be held at the nearest outlet that has a parcel collection point for collection by the recipient. Your recipient will be informed of this by email. If the item is collected by the recipient, the time and costs involved in returning it can be avoided.

In order that your customers can use the Retail Outlet Routing service, the following settings have to be carried out:

* Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and click on the *Shipping profiles* tab. Then activate the option *Agreement upon data transfer* in the shipping profile and select an option how the data (email address and phone number) is to be transferred.
** This setting is important for orders that come to your plentymarkets system via the online shop.
* Go to the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant and activate the service *Retail Outlet Routing*.
** Select in the drop-down list that opens below which email address should be transmitted for the Retail Outlet Routing service:
*** Transmit the email address of the recipient if available (_selected by default_)
*** Transmit an alternative email address
*** Transmit the email address of the recipient if available, otherwise an alternative

[IMPORTANT]
.Setting in the assistant has priority
====
The setting in the assistant regarding the transmission of the alternative data has priority over the settings in the shipping profile.
====

[#service-ident-check]
== Using the Ident check service

Make sure that your parcels are only delivered to the recipient in person – after the DHL driver has checked the identity and - where applicable- the age against the identity card and documented it.

In order that your customers can use the Ident check service (minimum age 16 or 18), the following setting is important:

* Go to the *DHL Shipping: Basic settings* assistant and activate the service *Ident check* in the *Product and services selection* step.

[[image-dhl-shipping-ident-check]]
.Example: DHL label with Ident check +18
image::fulfilment:dhl-shipping-label-ident-check.png[width=640, height=360]

[#dhl-warenpost]
== Using DHL Warenpost

Many items are too small to send them in parcels or packages. If you send many of those items, DHL Warenpost might be a convenient solution for you. DHL Warenpost can only be used for deliveries within Germany.

In order that you can offer your customers DHL Warenpost, the item and package data have to be correctly saved and transmitted to the shipping service provider. According to DHL, the following dimensions have to be maintained:

* Minimum dimension: Length: 10.0 cm, width: 7.0 cm, height: 0.1 cm
* Maximum dimension: Length: 35.3 cm, width: 25.0 cm, height: 5.0 cm
* Maximum weight: 1000 g

When registering the order, DHL checks the maximum dimensions and the maximum weight. The minimum dimensions are not checked by DHL when the order is registered.

The following sub-chapters describe the settings that you need to carry out in the <<#dhl-warenpost-settings-back-end, plentymarkets back end>>, in the <<#dhl-warenpost-settings-assistants, assistants>> and in the <<#dhl-warenpost-settings-gkp, DHL business customer portal>>:

[#dhl-warenpost-settings-back-end]
=== Settings in the back end

* It is recommended to save the weight of the variations that you want to send with DHL Warenpost in the variation’s *Dimensions* area.
* In order to ensure that the dimensions are not exceeded, you can use one of the two options that can be set up in the settings of the shipping package. You can find these options in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Shipping packages* menu in the drop-down list *Volume*.

[[image-dhl-shipping-warenpost-shipping-package]]
.Shipping package for DHL Warenpost: Volume
image::fulfilment:dhl-shipping-warenpost-shipping-package-volume.png[width=640, height=360]

The two options regarding the volume that you can select in the shipping package are explained in detail in the following:

[#from-shipping-package]
==== take from the shipping package

In order that the packages in the shipping centre are always generated with the correct dimensions and the order can be successfully registered with DHL Warenpost, you can use the option *take from the shipping package* and save the permissible maximum dimensions (length, width, height) in cm.

[[image-dhl-shipping-warenpost-dimensions]]
.Shipping package for DHL Warenpost: Dimensions
image::fulfilment:dhl-shipping-warenpost-shipping-package-dimensions.png[width=640, height=360]

If you select the settings mentioned above, the dimensions of the shipping package and the gross weight of all variations in the order are transferred to the shipping service provider.

[#from-item-data]
==== take from the item data (total)

*_Note:_* If you select the option *take from item data (total)*, _the weight only_ is transferred to the shipping service provider. The logic does not transfer the other dimensions (length, width, height).

You can, however, have the volume calculated based on a volume limitation in the shipping profile. To do so, select in the region of the corresponding shipping profile the limitation type *Maximum (cubic metres)* and save the calculated volume from the maximum dimensions in m³ that is prescribed for Warenpost by DHL:
`353 mm x 250 mm x 50 mm = 0,0044 m³`. +
Another possibility is to select the limitation type *Maximum (g)* in the region of the shipping profile and to save the calculated maximum weight of 1000 g that is prescribed for Warenpost by DHL.

You can select the shipping package as standard package in the corresponding region of the current shipping profile in the *Table of shipping charges* tab:

[[image-dhl-shipping-warenpost-standard-package]]
.Shipping package for DHL Warenpost as standard package in the shipping profile
image::fulfilment:dhl-shipping-warenpost-standard-package.png[width=640, height=360]

[#dhl-warenpost-settings-assistants]
=== Settings in the assistants

* Go to the *DHL Shipping: Basic settings* assistant and select the product *62 - Warenpost* in the *Billing number* step.

* Go to the *DHL Shipping: Settings combination* assistant and select the DHL billing number for Warenpost and the appropriate services that you want to link with this shipping setting.

[#dhl-warenpost-settings-gkp]
=== Settings in the DHL business customer portal

Go to the DHL business customer portal and select the appropriate size for the shipping labels:

[[image-dhl-shipping-warenpost]]
.Label sizes required for Warenpost
image::fulfilment:dhl-shipping-warenpost-label-size-german.png[width=640,height=360]

In the DHL business customer portal, go to the section *Ship > Basic settings > General settings* and set up the printer settings for your shipping labels. You can activate that the label size 100 x 70 mm is used for Warenpost. Note that it is not possible to print the additional name information for this label size: Sender name 2, sender name 3 and recipient name 3 _cannot_ be printed on the label.

You can also use the common label in the format of 100 x 200 mm for Warenpost.

For further information, refer to the link:https://www.dhl.de/en/geschaeftskunden/paket/leistungen-und-services/dhl-warenpost.html[DHL website^].

[#dhl-warenpost-international]
=== DHL Warenpost International

DHL Warenpost International is the ideal solution for shipping small and lightweight shipments worldwide not just affordably, but also quickly and reliably to your customers. The _Premium_ service offers additional transparency and reliability through tracking and liability.

When registering an international Warenpost shipment to an non-EU country, the CN22 form will automatically be generated on the label.

For further information, refer to the link:https://www.dhl.de/en/geschaeftskunden/paket/leistungen-und-services/warenpost-international.html[DHL website^].

== Customs declaration

You need a customs declaration for shipments that you send to countries outside the European Union, the so-called _CN23 form_. Customs declarations have to be attached to the outside of the package, preferably in a transparent, self-adhesive envelope. This way, the customs authority employees in the country of destination can see at a glance the value and the content of your package and can take out the form from the envelope for closer inspection, if needed.

The following data has to be entered on the CN23 form:

* Name and address of sender
* Name and address of recipient
* EORI number, i.e. the sender’s customs reference
** *_Note:_* If you saved your EORI number in the *Basics* assistant, this number will be shown automatically on the CN23 form.
* Recipient’s reference (applies to B2B only)
* Detailed description of contents
** *_Note:_* If the order contains more than 5 items, another page is added to the CN23 form that lists all items.
* Quantity, weight, value
* Customs tariff number
* Country of origin of the items
* Total weight of the package
* Total value of the package’s content
* Type of shipment
* Invoice number, if needed
* Date and sender’s signature
