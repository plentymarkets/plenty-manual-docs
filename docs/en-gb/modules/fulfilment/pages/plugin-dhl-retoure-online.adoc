[#set-up-warehouse]
=== Setting up a warehouse

You need to have a warehouse in order to save the information about returns that you receive from DHL. The warehouse is then selected in the assistant.

[TIP]
Each item is assigned to a warehouse. It is important that you select this warehouse also in the assistant. Otherwise, an error message occurs saying that there no connection exists between the warehouse and the country: `No settings found for the warehouse x and the country y`.

For further information about creating warehouses, refer to the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#[Setting up a warehouse] page of the manual.

[#activate-countries-of-delivery]

[#e-mail-qr-code]
== Adding a mobile return code to the email template

Insert the variable `DHL Retoure Online QR code` in your email templates to send your customers a QR code within the email. If your customers want to send back an item, they have to show the QR code on their smartphone to one of the employees in the post office and they will print the return label and attach it to the parcel.

Thus, your customers do no longer need a printer at home and you do no longer have to send the return label attached as PDF.
