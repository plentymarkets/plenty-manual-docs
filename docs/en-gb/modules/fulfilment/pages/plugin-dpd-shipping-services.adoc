Two DPD Shipping Services assistants that allow an easy setup are then available in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins* menu in the relevant plugin set.

Before completing the two DPD Shipping Services assistants, you need to complete the *Shipping settings* assistant. This assistant is available in your plentymarkets system by default. You can find it in the *Setup » Assistants » Integration* menu. With this assistant, carry out the following settings:

* determine a name for the shipping setting (i.e. the shipping profile)
* activate existing regions or create a new region
* determine the shipping costs and select the calculation type
* *_Note:_* Afterwards, go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and click on the *Shipping profiles* tab to carry out further settings for the shipping profile. Further information on these settings are provided below on this manual page.

Afterwards, complete the two DPD Shipping Services assistants:

* DPD Shipping Services: Basic settings
 ** In this assistant, prepare all the data that you later need in the *DPD Shipping Services: Settings combination* assistant.
* DPD Shipping Services: Settings combination +
 ** In this assistant, link the settings that you saved in the *Shipping settings* and *DPD Shipping Services: Basic settings* assistants and select the product and the appropriate services.

[#preparatory-settings]
== Carrying out the preparatory settings

First, you have to carry out some preparatory settings in the plentymarkets back end:

* <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#100, Set up countries of delivery>>

** You can set up the countries of delivery in the *Shipping settings* assistant or in the back end.

* <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#400, Create regions>>
** You can create regions in the *Shipping settings* assistant or in the back end.

* create the <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800, shipping service provider>> *DPD Shipping Services*
** Currently, you can create shipping service providers only in the back end and _not_ in an assistant.

* create a <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1000, shipping profile>> and the <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1500, table of shipping charges>> for *DPD Shipping Services* +
** You can set up some of the shipping settings in the *Shipping settings* assistant. The remaining settings have to be carried out in the back end in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* menu in the *Shipping profiles* tab. +
icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] *_Important:_* Not all functions and settings have been transferred from the shipping profile to the *Shipping settings* assistant yet. Note the explanations in the <<#assistant-shipping-settings, Completing the *Shipping settings* assistant>> chapter.

[#complete-assistant]
== Completing the assistants

As soon as you have <<plugins/installing-added-plugins#installing-plugins, installed>> the plugin in a plugin set, the *DPD Shipping Services: Basic settings* and the *DPD Shipping Services: Settings combination* assistants are available in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins* menu in the relevant plugin set. The *Shipping settings* assistant is available in your plentymarkets system by default. You can find it in the *Setup » Assistants » Integration* menu.

Now complete the assistants in the following order:

1. *Shipping settings*
2. *DPD Shipping Services: Basic settings*
3. *DPD Shipping Services: Settings combination*

[#assistant-shipping-settings]
=== Completing the *Shipping settings* assistant

You find the *Shipping settings* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Integration* menu. In this assistant, carry out the following settings:

* Enter a back end and a front end name for the shipping setting. These names can be selected per language. +
 ** Link this name later in the *DPD Shipping Services: Settings combination* assistant.

* Select the plugin of the shipping service provider for which you want to set up shipping costs. +
 ** You have to download the DPD Shipping Services plugin in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/dpdshippingservices_6320[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] before you can see it here.

* Select a region, enter the shipping costs and select the calculation type for the selected countries. Furthermore, you can determine the value of items from which no shipping costs will be calculated.

[IMPORTANT]
.Carry out further settings for the shipping settings in the back end
====
If you have completed the *Shipping settings* assistant, the shipping profile also appears in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* menu in the *Shipping profile* tab. +
The following settings are available once the assistant has been completed:

* the name of the shipping profile is saved
* the shipping service provider is saved
* the option *Activate for new items* is activated
* all clients (shops) are activated
* all order referrers are activated
* the shipping costs are saved
* the region is saved

If you want to carry out further settings such as blocking customer classes or payment methods or activating the option for the agreement upon data transmission to shipping service providers, you have to go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings* and carry out these settings in the *Shipping profiles* tab in the corresponding shipping profile.

icon:exclamation-triangle[role="red"] This workaround is still necessary because not all functions and settings have been transferred from the shipping profile to the assistant yet. We will implement the missing settings in the assistant step by step.
