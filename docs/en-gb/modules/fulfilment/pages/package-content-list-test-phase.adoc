:description: Learn how to work with the package content list in plentymarkets.
:author: team-payment-fulfillment

On this page of the manual, you find detailed information on how to use the package content list in plentymarkets. The package content list contains information about the content of pallets, packages and the respective items. Decide yourself how to pack your packages and easily manage them with only a few clicks. You want to send your package content list to your shipping service provider? No problem, just use the <<#export-order-content-as-csv, CSV export>>. Furthermore, the <<#use-quick-packing, quick packing>> function is now available, which allows you to quickly pack a huge amount of items into packages.

The *Orders » Package content list* menu is structured as follows:

image::fulfilment:pcl-2-0-menu-overview-en.png[width=640, height=360]

* *Navigation*: Here you can navigate through different parts of the menu. The currently selected area (blue font) is displayed in the main window on the right. Click on material:menu[] to expand or collapse the navigation bar. +
* *Toolbar*: Here you can <<#search-orders, search>> for orders, <<#customise-columns, customise the overview>>, set the results to be shown per page and click through the pages with the orders. +
* *Main window*: Here you can see whichever area is currently open.
** *Overview*: When you start a search, you’ll see the results in an overview. The overview provides information about the orders found at a glance. You can for example see the order type, the number of items in the order or the order status.
** *Detail view*: When you open an order, the <<#work-with-pallets, pallets>> and <<#work-with-packages, packages>> as well as details about the contents are displayed in the main window.

* With the group functions, you can carry out a variety of actions for several packages or pallets at once.
* The <<#use-quick-packing, quick packing>> function has been added and is especially helpful for big orders, as you can use it to pack many packages at once.
* Thanks to the connection to xref:markets:amazon-fba.adoc#[Amazon FBA], you can choose the <<#use-amazon-fba-service, FBA service>> and let them ship your items.
* You can now export the content of your orders as a <<#export-order-content-as-csv, CSV file>>.
