On this page, you find an overview of Amazon FBA Inbound as well as the most important links that you need to set up Amazon FBA Inbound.

== What does inbound mean?

Inbound means that you supply Amazon with items that Amazon then delivers to your customers.

* Inbound shipments are your shipments to an Amazon FBA Fulfillment Center.

* Inbound orders are the orders that are created in plentymarkets for your inbound shipments.


== What are my options?

Since 1 March 2023 the workflow of the Amazon FBA Inbound API has changed.
You can find further information in this link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/wichtige-amazon-fba-inbound-workflow-aenderung-wirksam-ab-01-03-2023-important-changes-on-the-amazon-fba-imbound-workflow-effective-starting-1st-march-2023/710262[forum article]. +
You have three options to create, edit and process your shipments.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Keep in mind that your shipments only remain available to plentymarkets when you use *option 2*.
====

=== Option 1: Using only Amazon Seller Central
You create and edit your shipments in the Seller Central (*Shipments » Send to Amazon*). With this option plentymarkets is not able to receive any data about these shipments from Amazon and editing or processing using plentymarkets will not be possible. You have to use solely the Seller Central.

=== Option 2: Using plentymarkets / Data transmission via API
You create your shipments in plentymarkets and plentymarkets transmits the data to Amazon via the API. 
For this you first create a redistribution order using the information of the shipment, as described xref:markets:amazon-fba.adoc#140[here].

[IMPORTANT]
====
As in this case the shipment is not created with Amazon first and then transmitted via the API but as a redistribution in plentymarkets, a *valid ASIN* should be entered in the item data. 
====
* You open the order for which you created the redistribution here: *Stock » Amazon FBA Inbound*. +
* You create an Amazon FBA Inbound shipment via the Amazon button at the top. +

* All further steps are the same as before. +

You edit your shipments *exclusively in plentymarkets*. To keep this option it is important that you do not perform any changes in Seller Central, otherwise option 3 will apply.

=== Option 3: Combination of plentymarkets and Amazon Seller Central
You create your shipments in plentymarkets as described in option 2 and you can edit them manually in the Seller Central. It is possible to switch to the Amazon backend at any step after creating a shipment in plentymarkets. But keep in mind: After you switch to the Seller Central, *plentymarkets will not be able to receive updated data about the shipment from Amazon via the API*.


== What do I have to set up?

[IMPORTANT]
.Which settings do I need to carry out in advance?
