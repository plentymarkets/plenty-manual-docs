|Outbound order undeliverable
a|If the outbound order with this status is in your plentymarkets system, the outbound order could not be delivered. +

====
Search for free, unused order statuses and use them. Do not overwrite in any case order statuses that are already in use because they might be used in other places in your plentymarkets system (e.g. in event procedures or processes). This might cause problems.

=== Setting up an event procedure to send a cancellation request

You can send a cancellation request for an outbound order if the outbound order has already been transferred to and accepted by eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex. Set up an event procedure to transmit this request.

[IMPORTANT]
.Order note when cancellation was not successful
====
If it is still possible to cancel the outbound order on behalf of eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex, your plentymarkets system moves the outbound order to status that you selected in the assistant. +
If it is not possible anymore to cancel the outbound order because the parcel has already been packed completely or has already been picked up, the outbound order remains in the status of the cancellation request and your plentymarkets system creates an order note saying that it was not possible to cancel the outbound order.

[#send-first-item]
=== Sending the first item

As soon as stock was booked in the warehouse of eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex, the stock in the eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex warehouse will automatically be updated in your plentymarkets system. To do so, you have to go the *eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex* assistant and <<#data-transfer-warehouse-settings, activate>> the option *Import stock* in the step *Data transfer and warehouse settings*.
From this moment on and on condition that all settings in your plentymarkets system were carried out correctly, it is possible to transfer the first outbound order to eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex.

If you have received orders for the same item that you sold from your own warehouse in the past, the plentymarkets system does not transfer an outbound order to eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex. Only does the transmission take place when eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex updates the stock for the corresponding warehouse.

If you have already decided to <<#ep-send-outbound-order, send the outbound orders automatically>>, nothing stands in the way of processing eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex orders.

[#faq-error-message-validity-refresh-token]
[.collapseBox]
.I get an error message with “invalid_grant” or “invalid refresh token”. What can I do?
--
You get the following (or similar) error?

`{„error“:„invalid_grant“,„error_description“:"Invalid refresh token:`

This means that the refresh token from Orange Connex has expired. Now you have to do the following:

. Go to the *eBay Fulfillment by Orange Connex* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants* menu in the *Integration* area.
. Open the *Authentication* step and enter your login details again. +
→ Another hint that the Orange Connex refresh token has expired is that you can see the *Authentication* step again in the assistant (because this step is usually not visible any longer once you have entered your login details for the first time).
