=== Order property type

Filters the selected key figure and dimension additionally by order property types.
Select a comparison operator on the left and then the desired order property type (material:check_box[role=skyBlue]).
If you want to narrow down the selected type even further, use the filter *Order property value*. By additionally setting this filter, you can define your own values, which are then applied to the type.
