:key-figure: Marketplace variation validation

The key figure *{key-figure}* allows you to check if the variation data of a catalogue complies to important rules of specific markets.

You can currently validate if the variations complies to important rules of the following markets:

* Amazon:
  ** Flatfile 2020.1109-1_Clothing_DE
  ** Flatfile 2020.1109-1_ConsumerElectronics_DE

During the validation, all mandatory fields are checked that are not specific to any product type.

[IMPORTANT]
.The marketplace variation validation is new!
