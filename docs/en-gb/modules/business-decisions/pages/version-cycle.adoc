plentymarkets is continuously being improved and developed further.
When a new function is released, it goes through three stages of development: Beta, Early and Stable.

[#10]
== Understanding the release cycle

[discrete]
=== Beta

Developer teams release their newly developed functions into the Beta version.
In this version, the function is tested and reported bugs are fixed.
The beta phase lasts a minimum of 7 days.

[discrete]
=== Early

After a minimum of 7 days, the Beta version is merged into the Early version. This assumes that no critical bugs were found during the Beta phase or that these bugs have been fixed. The early phase also lasts a minimum of 7 days.

* May still contain some bugs

[discrete]
=== Stable

After a minimum of 7 days, the Early version is merged into the Stable version. This assumes that no more serious bugs were found during the Early phase.

== Changing the version

Systems are given the Stable version by default.
However, if you want to benefit from improvements and new features earlier, then you can switch your system to an earlier version.

[IMPORTANT]
.This change cannot be undone
====
We’re happy that you want to help make plentymarkets even better by using an earlier version and reporting bugs.
But note that once you switch to an earlier version, it will not be possible to switch back.
Carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the versions before switching your system.
====

[.instruction]
Switching your system to an earlier version:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Settings » Version*. +
*_Note_*: All clients have the same version.
So if you work with multiple clients, then they will all be switched to the new version.
. Use the drop-down list to select the version that you want to switch the system to. +
*_Important_*: You can only switch the system to an earlier version.
It is not possible to switch to a later version.
. *Save* (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the setting. +
→ The system will be switched to the selected version.
This can take up to 30 minutes.
