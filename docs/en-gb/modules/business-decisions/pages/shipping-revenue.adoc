:key-figure: Shipping revenue

include::../../_textblocks/plentyBI-template/key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentymarkets calculates the key figure *Shipping revenue* by summing up the shipping costs of the order items: +
_âˆ‘ Shipping costs = Shipping revenue_ +
By choosing a <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/key-figures/shipping-revenue#100, calculation type>>, you decide whether to calculate the gross shipping sales or the net shipping sales.
Thus, you can either have the gross shipping sales with sales taxes or the net shipping sales without sales taxes displayed.
In addition, select a <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/key-figures/shipping-revenue#200, dimension>> to determine how the result is grouped.
Set <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/key-figures/shipping-revenue#300, filters>> to specify the criteria for the calculation of the shipping revenue.
