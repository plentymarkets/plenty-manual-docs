Thus, you can either have the gross shipping sales with sales taxes or the net shipping sales without sales taxes displayed.
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:shipping-revenue.adoc#200[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:shipping-revenue.adoc#300[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the shipping revenue.
