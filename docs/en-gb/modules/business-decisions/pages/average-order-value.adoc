:key-figure: Average order value

include::partial$key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentymarkets calculates the key figure *Average order value* by multiplying the quantity of order items with the corresponding prices.
This result is then divided by the quantiy of orders: +
_(Quantity × Price) : Quantity of orders = ø Order value_ +
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:average-order-value.adoc#100[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:average-order-value.adoc#200[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the average order value.
Make sure to be aware of the information given for the filter *order type*.
