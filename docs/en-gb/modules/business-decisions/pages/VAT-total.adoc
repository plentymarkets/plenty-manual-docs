:key-figure: VAT total

plentymarkets calculates the VAT total by subtracting the net prices of the order items from the gross prices of the order items.
The results are then summed up: +
_(Gross price - net price) = VAT amount_ +
_âˆ‘ VAT amount = VAT total_ +
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:VAT-total.adoc#100[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:VAT-total.adoc#200[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the VAT total.
