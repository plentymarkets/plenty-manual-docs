:author: team platform:

In the central login you login into every system that is connected with your plentysystems account and manage the language and time zone for those systems. Additionally, you assign passwords for you plentysystems account and activate the multi-factor authentication.

//.Redirect to central login
//===
Since the 28th February 2024 you are redirected from plentymarkets-cloud-de.com and plentymarkets-cloud-ie.com to account.plentysystems.com. Until then, administrators and non-administrators can still use the old login. This means,you only need one URL to login.
//====

[TIP]
.Central login URL with PID and user name
====
You can edit the central login URL, so that PID and/or user name are prefilled. The URL  *\\https://account.plentysystems.com/login?pid=1234&user=JohnDoe* has the PID 1234 and the user name JohnDoe prefilled. Take this URL and adjust it for your system. You can also just fill in the PID.
