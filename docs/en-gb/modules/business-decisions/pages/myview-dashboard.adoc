In the constantly changing world of e-commerce, it is essential to keep an overview of the numbers and data of your online business. Thus, plentymarkets offers you a new dashboard that enables you to access the current key figures of your company and decide if further action is needed. Create your individual dashboard by combining various key figures, statistics, graph types and format options. The dashboard allows you to be as flexible and creative as you like.

Especially when creating your first dashboard view, there are some points to consider. First, carry out the preparatory settings and follow the instructions in the following chapters carefully:

** <<#200, Creating key figures>>
** <<#300, Assigning user rights>>
** <<#400, Setting up a dashboard view>>

[#100]
== Carrying out the preparatory settings

Only a few preparatory steps are necessary before you can set up your individual dashboard view. These settings are described in the following chapters.

[#200]
=== Creating key figures

[IMPORTANT]
.Key figures available according to plentyBI edition
====
Some key figures can only be used if you have booked the corresponding plentyBI edition. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » My account » Contracts*. Click on *Edit contract* and go to the step *Choose plentyBI edition*. Here, you can choose between plentyBI editions with various scopes. In addition, more precise information on the required plentyBI edition is displayed for each key figure when you set it up in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.
====

To display data on your dashboard, you need to create the corresponding key figures first.

Key figures essentially allow you to create different data sets. This way, key figures are a basis for the values and data that you can then display and track on your dashboard. Your plentymarkets system provides so-called dimensions for each key figure. Dimensions determine the criteria that are used to group the data included in the key figure.
This way, you can precisely define the conditions for the calculation of each key figure.

You can either create key figures in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu or directly from the dashboard. Both methods are described below.

[NOTE]
.Pay attention to user rights
====
If users without admin access to your plentymarkets system should be allowed to create key figures, assign the <<#300, necessary user rights>> first.
====

--
====

[#300]
=== Assigning rights

When working with key figures, you should decide which of your employees should be allowed to view which key figures. Users with admin access to your plentymarkets system can view all key figures and create new key figures by default.
Users with a *Back end* account have to be assigned those rights by a user with an admin account.

Proceed as described below to determine which key figures should be visible for users.

[.instruction]
Assigning rights for viewing key figures:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*. +
→ The overview opens. +
*_Optional:_* In the filter settings on the left, enter an ID or a name to limit the search results.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The user accounts that correspond to the search criteria are displayed. +
*_Tip:_* Accounts that are greyed out have admin rights.
. Click on the appropriate account.
. Click on *Resources*.
. Click on *Key figures*.
. Activate all key figures that should be visible for the user. +
*_Optional:_* Click on *All key figures* if all existing key figures should be visible for the user.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

Do you want to allow employees without admin access to your system to create key figures? Then carry out the following additional settings.

[#400]
== Setting up a dashboard view

[IMPORTANT]
.Function only available for admins
====
Dashboard views can only be set up by users of the type *Admin*. However, users of the type *Back end* may be able to see the view later if they have been assigned the necessary <<#408, rights for dashboard views>>.
====

As soon as you have carried out the <<#100, preparatory settings>>, you are ready to set up your dashboard.

The first steps on a new dashboard always consist of placing different areas for display on the dashboard. Then, you fill these areas with data that can be displayed in the form of different elements. You can add and individually position several elements per area.

[#407]
=== Setting up a new dashboard view

In addition to the default view available in the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu, you can create and save additional individual views. Depending on how detailed the visualisation of data on your dashboard should be, you can create separate views for different topics and data.

[IMPORTANT]
.Function only available for admins
====
New dashboard views can only be set up by users of the type *Admin*. However, users of the type *Back end* may be able to see the view later if they have been assigned the necessary <<#408, rights for dashboard views>>.
====

[.instruction]
Setting up a new dashboard view:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard*.
. Click on *Default view* in the upper right corner.
. Click on *Create new preset*.
. Assign a *Name* for the view.
. Click on *Create view*. +
→ The new view opens. By default, a new view is always a copy of the view that you have created before. Use the <<#405, editing mode>> to delete elements that are not needed and to add further elements to the newly created view.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ The new view is saved.

For each dashboard view, you can restrict access to certain users or user roles. Refer to the following chapter for more information.

[#405]
=== Using the editing mode

You can position areas for content and elements on the dashboard intuitively via drag-and-drop. Use the editing mode (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]) to further adjust areas or elements or undo changes, if needed.

:menu-path: pass:quotes[*plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard*]
:edit-object: dashboard contents

include::_includes:partial$myview-editing-mode.adoc[]

[#408]
=== Assigning rights for dashboard views

Decide which users should see the default view.  You can also restrict or allow access for additional dashboard views per user or user role. Note that users of the type *Back end* cannot edit dashboard views or create new views even if they have been assigned those rights.

Open the editing mode (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]) for an already existing <<#407, dashboard view>>. Click on *Rights management* to access the settings for users and user roles and decide which dashboard view(s) should be visible for them.

Additional information and instructions on how to assign rights to users or roles are available on the xref;business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#112[User accounts and access] page of the manual.

[#409]
=== Determining visibility of dashboard views

In addition to <<#408, assigning rights for dashboard views>>, there are further possibilities to determine the visibility of dashboard views in the side navigation on the left margin of the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu.

As a logged in user, you can easily see which dashboard views you can access and quickly switch between them. In the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu, click on the menu icon on the left (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]). A list of dashboard views that have been made visible to you opens. Click on a dashboard view to open it. The currently opened dashboard view is displayed in blue on the list.

[IMPORTANT]
.Take note of rights for dashboard views
====
The functionalities described here do not influence the rights that have been assigned to individual users. Rather, they determine how already existing dashboard views are displayed and accessed in the side navigation. Make sure that the users of your system have the respective <<#408, rights for dashboard views>> or, depending on the case, are not assigned rights if they should not have access to certain content.
====

[.instruction]
Determining visibility of dashboard views:

. Open the editing mode (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]) for an already existing <<#407, dashboard view>>.
. Activate the option *Expand side navigation* and/or *Hide from side navigation*. Pay attention to the information provided in <<table-dashboard-nav-settings>>. +
*_Note:_* These options are only visible to admin users and can only be carried out by them.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[[table-dashboard-nav-settings]]

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Expand side navigation*
| If this option is activated, the side navigation on the left margin of the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu is expanded every time the menu is opened. This setting takes effect for all users. The side navigation lists all existing dashboard views to which the respective user has been granted access rights and for which the option *Hide from side navigation* has not been activated.

| *Hide from side navigation*
| Should the dashboard view be excluded from the side navigation? Then activate this option. +
*_Note:_* Even if this option is activated, users with the respective rights can still access the dashboard view by clicking on the tab in the editing mode. Refer to the chapter <<#405, Available functions in the editing mode>> for more information on this.

[#410]
== Adding and using dashboard elements

[IMPORTANT]
.Function only available for admins
====
Dashboard elements can only be added by users of the type *Admin*. However, users of the type *Back end* may be able to see the added elements later if they have been assigned the necessary <<#408, rights for dashboard views>>.
====

The dashboard offers you different possibilities to display key figures and other important information. Thus, you can visualise data in the exact way you need. The following types of elements are available:

* <<#500, Tiles>>
* <<#600, Tables>>
* <<#700, Graphs>>
* <<#800, Rows>>
* <<#900, Notifications>>
* <<#1100, Important forum announcements>>

The process of placing an element on the dashboard is always the same, regardless of the element type. The following instructions explain how it works.

[.instruction]
Placing areas and elements on the dashboard:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard*.
. Click on *Edit view* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]).
. Drag-and-drop an element from the settings menu on the dashboard.
. Move the cursor over the element and click on *Edit* (icon:design_inline_edit[set=plenty]). +
→ The settings menu opens. +
→ The possible elements for the area are displayed.
. Select an element from the settings menu and drag-and-drop it within the area on the dashboard.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Collapse areas on the dashboard
====
Have you placed a lot of areas on your dashboard and want to keep the overview? The option *Collapse area* is available for each area. Activate this option to collapse the area on the dashboard by default. Click on (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]) to open the area and see the data displayed within whenever needed.
====

The following chapters describe how to use the different elements and which settings are possible for each element.

Have you set up a <<#410, tile or another element>> on your dashboard and want to use this element again with similar settings, but don’t want to carry out all settings once again?

Then, you can copy already existing elements in an area and paste it to the same area. Initially, the settings of the new element are identical to the settings of the original element. After you have pasted the element, you can adjust the settings according to your needs and thus change its appearance. The original element will remain unchanged.

Have you set up your dashboard using the elements described on this page and want to flexibly display data for specific time intervals now?
To do so, you can use the *Global time interval* element which you can see in <<image-global-time-interval>>. It enables you to temporarily display the data of all charts, tables and tiles for one identical time interval. The options *Month*, *Day*, *Week*, *Quarter* and *Year* are available. If you click on *Reset*, the data will once again be displayed according to the time interval that you have selected in the settings of the respective chart, table or tile.
