:author: team-app-bi

In the constantly changing world of e-commerce, it is essential to keep an overview of the numbers and data of your online business. Thus, plentymarkets offers you a new dashboard that enables you to access the current key figures of your company and decide if further action is needed. Create your individual dashboard by combining various key figures, statistics, graph types and format options. The dashboard allows you to be as flexible and creative as you like.

Especially when creating your first dashboard view, there are some points to consider. First, carry out the preparatory settings and follow the instructions in the following chapters carefully:

** <<#200, Creating key figures>>
** <<#300, Assigning user rights>>
** <<#400, Setting up a dashboard view>>

[#100]
== Carrying out the preparatory settings

Only a few preparatory steps are necessary before you can set up your individual dashboard view. These settings are described in the following chapters.

[#200]
=== Creating key figures

To display data on your dashboard, you need to create the corresponding key figures first.

Key figures essentially allow you to create different data sets. This way, key figures are a basis for the values and data that you can then display and track on your dashboard. Your plentymarkets system provides so-called dimensions for each key figure. Dimensions determine the criteria that are used to group the data included in the key figure.
This way, you can precisely define the conditions for the calculation of each key figure.

You can either create key figures in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu or directly from the dashboard. Both methods are described below.

If users without admin access to your plentymarkets system should be allowed to create key figures, assign the <<#300, necessary user rights>> first.

*_Note_* that some key figures can only be used if you have booked the corresponding plentyBI edition. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » My account » Contracts*. Click on *Edit contract* and go to the step *Choose plentyBI edition*. Here, you can choose between plentyBI editions with various scopes. In addition, more precise information on the required plentyBI edition is displayed for each key figure when you set it up in the *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* menu.

[TIP]
.Default key figures available
====
The key figures xref:business-decisions:orders-key-figure.adoc#[Orders], xref:business-decisions:live-orders.adoc#[Orders (Live)] and xref:business-decisions:revenue.adoc#[Revenue] are so-called default key figures. This means that they are already set up in your system with some preparatory settings. This way, you can get on with the setup much quicker. You can use these key figures free of charge. Go to *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* and click on the desired key figure to adjust the predefined settings according to your needs. Afterwards, you can start with integrating these key figures <<#410, on your dashboard>>.

[#300]
=== Assigning rights

When working with key figures, you should decide which of your employees should be allowed to view which key figures. Users with admin access to your plentymarkets system can view all key figures and create new key figures by default.
Users with a *Back end* account have to be assigned those rights by a user with an admin account.

Proceed as described below to determine which key figures should be visible for users.

[.instruction]
Assigning rights for viewing key figures:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User*. +
→ The overview opens. +
*_Optional:_* In the filter settings on the left, enter an ID or a name to limit the search results.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The user accounts that correspond to the search criteria are displayed. +
*_Tip:_* Accounts that are greyed out have admin rights.
. Click on the appropriate account.
. Click on *Resources*.
. Click on *Key figures*.
. Activate all key figures that should be visible for the user. +
*_Optional:_* Click on *All key figures* if all existing key figures should be visible for the user.
. *Save* (terra:save[]) the settings.

Do you want to allow employees without admin access to your system to create key figures? Then carry out the following additional settings.

== Setting up a dashboard view

[IMPORTANT]
.Function only available for admins
====
Dashboard views can only be set up by users of the type *Admin*. However, users of the type *Back end* may be able to see the view later if they have been assigned the necessary <<#408, rights for dashboard views>>.
====

As soon as you have carried out the <<#100, preparatory settings>>, you are ready to set up your dashboard.

The first steps on a new dashboard always consist of placing different areas for display on the dashboard. Then, you fill these areas with data that can be displayed in the form of different elements. You can add and individually position several elements per area.

[#407]
=== Setting up a new dashboard view

In addition to the default view available in the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu, you can create and save additional individual views. Depending on how detailed the visualisation of data on your dashboard should be, you can create separate views for different topics and data.

[IMPORTANT]
.Function only available for admins
====
New dashboard views can only be set up by users of the type *Admin*. However, users of the type *Back end* may be able to see the view later if they have been assigned the necessary <<#408, rights for dashboard views>>.
====

[.instruction]
Setting up a new dashboard view:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard*.
. Click on *Default view* in the upper right corner.
. Click on *Create new preset*.
. Assign a *Name* for the view.
. Click on *Create view*. +
→ The new view opens. By default, a new view is always a copy of the view that you have created before. Use the <<#405, editing mode>> to delete elements that are not needed and to add further elements to the newly created view.
. *Save* (terra:save[]) the settings. +
→ The new view is saved.

For each dashboard view, you can restrict access to certain users or user roles. Refer to the following chapter for more information.

[#405]
=== Using the editing mode

You can position areas for content and elements on the dashboard intuitively via drag-and-drop. Use the editing mode (terra:design_inline_edit[]) to further adjust areas or elements or undo changes, if needed.

:menu-path: pass:quotes[*plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard*]

include::_includes:partial$myview-editing-mode.adoc[]

[#408]
=== Assigning rights for dashboard views

Decide which users should see the default view.  You can also restrict or allow access for additional dashboard views per user or user role. Note that users or roles of the type *Back end* cannot edit dashboard views or create new views, even if they have been assigned those rights.

Open the editing mode (terra:design_inline_edit[]) for an already existing <<#407, dashboard view>>. Click on *Rights management* to access the settings for users and user roles and decide which dashboard view(s) should be visible for them.

Additional information and instructions on how to assign rights to users or roles are available on the xref;business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#112[User accounts and access] page of the manual.

[#409]
=== Determining visibility of dashboard views

In addition to <<#408, assigning rights for dashboard views>>, there are further possibilities to determine the visibility of dashboard views in the side navigation on the left margin of the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu.

As a logged in user, you can easily see which dashboard views you can access and quickly switch between them. In the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard* menu, click on the menu icon on the left (icon:bars[role="darkGrey"]). A list of dashboard views that have been made visible to you opens. Click on a dashboard view to open it. The currently opened dashboard view is displayed in blue on the list.

[IMPORTANT]
.Take note of rights for dashboard views
====
The functionalities described here do not influence the rights that have been assigned to individual users. Rather, they determine how already existing dashboard views are displayed and accessed in the side navigation. Make sure that the users of your system have the respective <<#408, rights for dashboard views>> or, depending on the case, are not assigned rights if they should not have access to certain content.
====

[.instruction]
Determining visibility of dashboard views:

. Open the editing mode (terra:design_inline_edit[]) for an already existing <<#407, dashboard view>>.
. Activate the option *Expand side navigation* and/or *Hide from side navigation*. Pay attention to the information provided in <<table-dashboard-nav-settings>>. +
*_Note:_* These options are only visible to admin users and can only be carried out by them.

| *Additional time interval*
| This setting displays additional buttons on the top right of the bar chart or line graph. These buttons allow you to filter the data displayed in the graph according to additional time intervals. This way, you can easily switch between different time intervals. Activate one or more of the options *Day*, *Month*, *Quarter* or *Year*. +
*_Example:_* If you have previously selected the current month for the option *Time interval*, you can use the additional time interval to display buttons that display the data filtered by days or weeks when you click on them.

| *Click on bar for precise time interval* (only available for bar charts)
| Activate this option to display the data of the bar chart for the next smaller time interval. You can click on the bar repeatedly, until the smallest time interval (days) has been reached. Use the button *Reset interval* on the top right of the diagram to quickly return to the original display of data.

| *Number of columns*
| Select how many units of the selected time interval should be displayed in the graph or chart. The starting point depends on the selected time period.

| *Activate zoom*
| Activate this option to enable the zoom function for the graph or chart. In addition, determine a *Start value* to which the zoom should be set by default whenever the dashboard is opened. If you access the dashboard later, a blue bar with a control element will be displayed. Use this to zoom in and out of the graph or chart to see more detailed data, if needed.

| *Display average line* (only available for bar charts)
| Activate this option to display a line that represents the average values in addition to the bars. The average values are calculated from the results of the key figures that have been selected for display in the chart. +
*_Note:_* This option is only available if you have selected more than one key figure to be displayed in the bar chart.

| *Display horizontally* (only available for bar charts)
| Activate this option to rotate the bar chart by 90 degrees. This automatically inverts the axes of the the bar chart.

[#746]
==== Funnel chart

You can use funnel charts to visualise the relations between different key figures and how they develop over time. For example, it is possible to represent how many offers were sent to customers, how many new orders were placed and how many return orders were created. To do so, you create a key figure configuration for each of the order types mentioned and then select them for display in the funnel chart.
The elements of the funnel chart represent the result per key figure by their varying heights. The system assigns separate colours to each element. The elements are placed next to each other, so that the representation resembles a funnel.

=== Using global filters

The *Global filters* element offers you numerous ways to filter the data on your dashboard. After you have carried out all settings, the global filters are displayed permanently. This helps you to keep an overview. In many cases, setting up global filters will save you the effort of having to create an entirely new dashboard view.

In the following chapters, you will learn <<#851, how to place the element on the dashboard>> and how to determine once in advance <<#852, which filters should be available>>. In addition, you can set up <<#855, pre-defined default filters>> that will be applied automatically every time the dashboard view is opened.

[#851]
==== Adding the element

To use global filters, you first need to place the respective element on your dashboard.

[.instruction]
Adding the element:

. Go to *plentymarkets logo (Start) » Dashboard*.
. Click on *Edit view* (terra:design_inline_edit[]).
. Use drag-and-drop to place the *Global time interval* element on the dashboard.
. *Save* (terra:save[]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Recommended position for the element
====
The *Global filters* element can only be added once to each dashboard view. Thus, we recommend that you place the element in a position that is easy to see.
====

[#852]
==== Carrying out filter settings

After you have placed the *Global filters* element on the dashboard, carry out more detailed settings. Select which filters should be available and which search criteria should be displayed for each filter.

[.instruction]
Carrying out filter settings:

. Click on *Edit* (terra:edit[]) in the top right corner of the *Global filters* element. +
→ The settings menu opens.
. Carry out the settings for the element. Note the explanations provided further down in this chapter.
. *Save* (terra:save[]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Which filters are available?
====
The filters available in the settings menu of the *Global filters* element depend on the key figures that are displayed on the respective dashboard view. More precisely, the available filters are the exact same filters that you have selected in the key figure configurations. +
*_Example:_* If one or more key figures have been set up with the filter *Shipping profile*, this filter will be available and you can carry out settings for this filter. Accordingly, filters that are not used in any of your key figure configurations are not displayed in the settings menu.
====

As an example, <<image-global-filters>> shows a list of filters that can be available for the *Global filters* element.

.Example: Available filters
[[image-global-filters]]
image::business-decisions:global-filter-settings-1.png[width=640, height=360]

First, activate (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the filters that should be available for use in the element later.

For most filters, you can click on *Edit* (terra:edit[role="darkGrey"]) to determine which search criteria should be displayed for each filter. This way, you avoid having to scroll through long drop-down lists and the filter can be used quickly later. Activate (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the search criteria that you need. <<image-global-filter-settings>> shows a sample selection of criteria for the *Invoice country* filter.

.Example: Selection of filter criteria
[[image-global-filter-settings]]

[#853]
==== Applying filters

After saving the settings, filters for which the settings described above are carried out are displayed on the dashboard as shown in <<image-global-filter-display>>.

.Example: Display of filters
[[image-global-filter-display]]

Now, you can apply this filter every time you access the dashboard.

[.instruction]

. Click on *Filter* (material:tune[role="darkGrey"]).
. Click on (icon:chevron-right[role="darkGrey"]) at the right of the desired filter. +

→ The filter is applied and the dashboard view is reloaded. Afterwards, the filtered data is displayed. +
*_Tip:_* The filter criteria that are currently applied are displayed at the top as so-called “chips”. Click on material:clear[role="darkGrey"] to delete the filter.

[#855]
==== Using default filters

==== Adjusting the global time interval

Global filters enable you to temporarily display the data of all charts, tables and tiles for a specific time interval. The options *Month*, *Day*, *Week*, *Quarter* and *Year* are available. Would you like to filter all data so that you could see the values for the current week? Simply click on *Week*. If you click on *Reset*, the data will once again be displayed according to the time interval that you have selected in the settings of the respective chart, table or tile. <<image-global-filter-time-interval>> shows what the options for adjusting the time interval look like.
