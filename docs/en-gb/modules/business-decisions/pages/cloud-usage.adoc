Item images, receipts, order documents and a variety of other data of your plentymarkets system are stored in the cloud. This kind of storage is limited depending on your plentymarkets edition. You will be billed separately if you exceed the amount of memory available to you. This is why you can track the cloud usage of your plentymarkets system uses at any time.
