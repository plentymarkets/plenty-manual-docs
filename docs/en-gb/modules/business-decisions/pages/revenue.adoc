:key-figure: Revenue

include::../../_textblocks/plentyBI-template/key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentymarkets calculates the key figure *Revenue* based on the order items.
The quantity of the order items is multiplied by the corresponding prices: +
_Quantity × Price = Revenue_ +
By choosing a <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/key-figures/revenue#100, calculation type>>, you decide whether to calculate with gross prices or net prices.
Thus, you can either have the gross revenue or the net revenue displayed.
In addition, select a <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/key-figures/revenue#200, dimension>> to determine how the result is grouped.
Set <<business-decisions/plenty-bi/key-figures/revenue#300, filters>> to specify the criteria for the calculation of the revenue.
