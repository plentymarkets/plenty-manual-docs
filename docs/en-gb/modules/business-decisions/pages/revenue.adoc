:key-figure: Revenue

include::partial$key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentysystems calculates the revenue based on the order items.
The quantity of the order items is multiplied by the corresponding prices: +
_Quantity × Price = Revenue_ +
By choosing a xref:business-decisions:revenue.adoc#100[calculation type], you decide whether to calculate with gross prices or net prices.
Thus, you can either have the gross revenue or the net revenue displayed.
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:revenue.adoc#200[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:revenue.adoc#300[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the revenue.

[IMPORTANT]
.Using the default key figure
====
The key figure *Revenue* is a so-called default key figure. This means that it is already set up in your system with some preparatory settings. Two different configurations are available, which you can use free of charge. Thus, you don’t necessarily have to create an additional key figure. Go to *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* and click on the key figure *Revenue* that has been created by *plentymarkets*. If needed, adjust the preselected options and add the desired <<#200, filters>>.
