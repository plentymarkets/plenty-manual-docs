Create accounts for new users and edit existing user accounts in the user menu. Furthermore, assign roles and accesses to users.

* Roles are used for grouping users and assigning the same rights to multiple user accounts in a very convenient way.
* Accesses allow you to assign rights to specific users and interfaces. For example, assign API calls to users of the API access individually.

Five free CUL user licences are included in every plentymarkets system. If you need additional user accounts, book them in the link:http://www.plentymarkets.co.uk/prices/[configurator]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

[NOTE]
.What is a CUL user licence?
====
CUL stands for concurrent user licencing. The licence determines how many user accounts can have access to the plentymarkets back end, the REST API and the plentymarkets app. As such, we limit simultaneous use and not the number of user accounts you can create.

== Creating a user account

When using your plentymarkets system for the first time, a default user account of the access type *Admin* with administrative rights is already set up in the system. You need at least one admin user account. As such, either create a new user account of the *Admin* access and delete the default user account afterwards or edit the existing user account. Proceed as described below to create a new user of any access type.

include::./system-administration/_textblocks/instructions/benutzerkonto-erstellen-en_gb.adoc[]

The user name must not contain any spaces and has to have at least 5 characters.

Click on *My account* to open your own user account.

The user accesses are preset and the accesses' settings cannot be changed. The following table includes detailed information about preset rights and rights that you can assign individually:

[[table-user-accesses]]
.Overview of available user accesses
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Access |Explanation

|Access with individual rights for <<#100, menus>> and <<#110, functions>> that can be assigned in the *Rights* tab.

| *REST API*
|Access for <<#120, REST calls>> that can be assigned in the user account. REST calls are activated individually. REST calls are not assigned to user accounts by default. +

.*Rights* tab of a back end user account
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Sales warehouse*; +
*Repair warehouse*; +
*Storage warehouse*; +
*Transit warehouse*; +
*Distribution warehouse*; +
*Special warehouse* (type *Other*) +
|Grant rights for warehouses to the user. Only previously created <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse#300, warehouse types>> are available. +
*All* = The user has access to all warehouses. +
*None* = The user has access to none of the warehouses.

| *Visible order statuses*
|Select which order statuses should be *visible* to the user. The user will see orders that are in this status only.

| *Selectable order statuses*
|Select which order statuses the user should be allowed to apply.

| *Clients (stores)*
|Select one, several or all clients that should be visible to the user. Users will only be able to see those areas that they were given access to in the Rights tab. If no client is selected, specific rights such as the right to access certain menus will not go into effect. This is because the user will not have access to any of the clients. +
*All* = The user has access to all clients. +
*Default* = The user has access to the default store.

| *Ticket status*
|Select ticket statuses. Users will be able to view and edit tickets that are in these statuses. +
*Invisible* = The user will not see tickets with this status. +
*Visible* = The user will see all tickets that are in this status. +
*Own only* = The user will only see tickets that are in this status and that they own. +
All tickets are listed in the ticket overview, including those tickets that are not visible to the user account. However, the user is unable to open invisible tickets.

[#105]
== Managing rights
With rights you define which areas and settings are visible to the user and what they may edit. You can assign rights to every user account individually or to multiple user accounts via roles.
In the *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User* menu, you can assign rights to individual users. This contains the REST API authorisations, the menu visibilities and the plugin menu visibilities.
Likewise, it is possible to assign rights for roles. This does not apply to the plugin menu visibilities. In case a role is assigned to a user that already has further rights, all of the rights are  effective.
In the *Resources* menu item, order referrers that should be visible to the user can be released. +
Assign every user account only those rights required for their field of work. This way, security is increased and errors can be prevented in your system.

[#110]
=== Assigning rights

The user rights in the *Setup » Settings » User » Rights » User* menu are divided into the 3 areas listed below.

|====

include::system-administration/_textblocks/instructions/rechte-vergen-en_gb.adoc[]

[TIP]
The areas *Authorisations* and *Menu visibilities* are linked, which is why the selected rights are automatically activated for both areas.

[NOTE]
If further rights are required, an error message appears. Example: The *Blog* menu item requires rights for “Show blog” and “Show tag”.

[#112]
=== Assigning rights for user-defined views

[#80]
== Editing roles

After creating a role, it will open in a new tab for editing. The role is also added to the role overview so that you can open and edit it easier. Roles are listed alphabetically in the overview. Every role is divided into 3 tabs. In the *Settings* tab, you can change the role's name. In the *User* tab you link user accounts to this role. In the *Rights* tab you assign rights to the role. The same settings used for user accounts of the *Back end* access are also available for roles. For further information about rights, refer to the <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#105, Managing rights>> chapter.

Users of the *Admin* or *Back end* access can create roles. User accounts of the *Back end* access need to have the corresponding rights to do so.

[.instruction]

. Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts*.
. Open a user account.

[TIP]
.Linking user roles to users of the Admin access
====
Administrators have all rights. However, it is important that roles are assigned to administrators for some processes. For example, administrators only receive role-specific emails when linked to the corresponding role.
====

[.subhead]
Example of use

The administrator of the company MyStore creates multiple roles. All the rights to be assigned to every user account are included in the Employee role. With this role, it is no longer necessary to assign these rights to every single user. Also, changes to rights concerning all user accounts can be made in the Employee role. In addition to this role, the administrator creates the Warehouse technician and Accounting roles - specific roles for a small group of users only.

.Example for roles
[cols="1,3,3"]
|====
|Role |Rights |Menu visibilities

| *Employees*
|Clients (stores) » Standard
|Start » Webmail +
Start » Forum

| *Warehouse technician*
|Warehouse
|Setup » Stock » Warehouse +
Stock +
Orders » Fulfilment

| *Accounting*
|
|Start » Vacation +
Setup » Client » Select client » Accounting
|====

Mr. Doe is a logistics specialist at MyStore and receives the Employee and Warehouse technician roles. If a user account has several roles, the user rights are added up. Therefore, Mr. Doe receives the rights *Clients (stores)*, *Webmail* and *Forum* from the Employee role as well as the rights *Warehouse*, *Stock* and *Fulfilment* from the Warehouse technician role. However, he doesn't have the *Vacation* and *Accounting* rights because the Accounting role wasn't assigned to his user account.
