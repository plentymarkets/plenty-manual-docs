:key-figure: The key figure Orders (Live)

include::partial$key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentysystems calculates the live number of orders by checking and loading the orders from the database in real time. +
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:live-orders.adoc#200[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:live-orders.adoc#300[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the sales volume.
Note that those orders are counted that you define in the filter *Order type*. If you don't set this filter, all orders of all order types are counted.

[IMPORTANT]
.Using the default key figure configuration
====
The key figure configuration *Orders (Live)* is a so-called default key figure configuration. This means that it is already set up in your plentysystems system with some preparatory settings. Thus, you don’t necessarily have to create an additional key figure configuration. Go to *Setup » plentyBI » Key figure configurations* and click on the key figure configuration*Orders (Live)* that has been created by *plentymarkets*.
