:key-figure: Gross revenue

include::partial$key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentymarkets calculates the gross revenue based on the order items.
The purchase price is subtracted from the net price of the order item.
This result is then multiplied with the corresponding quantity of the order items: +
_(Net price - purchase price) Ã— Quantity = Gross revenue_ +
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:gross-revenue.adoc#100[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:gross-revenue.adoc#200[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the gross revenue.
