:key-figure: Orders

include::partial$key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentysystems calculates the number of orders by summing up the orders: +
_∑ Orders = Number of orders_ +
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:orders-key-figure.adoc#100[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:orders-key-figure.adoc#200[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the sales volume.
Note that those orders are counted that you define in the filter *Order type*. If you don't set this filter, all orders of all order types are counted.

[IMPORTANT]
.Using the default key figure
====
The key figure *Orders* is a so-called default key figure. This means that it is already set up in your system with some preparatory settings.  Thus, you don’t necessarily have to create an additional key figure. Go to *Setup » plentyBI » Key figures* and click on the key figure *Orders* that has been created by `plentymarkets`. If needed, adjust the preselected options and add the desired <<#200, filters>>.
