== Your contract with plentymarkets

Open the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account » Contracts* to see and edit information about your contract with plentymarkets.

[TIP]

Contract information is now managed in the “My account” area.
====

[#30]
=== Changing your edition

plentymarkets grows along with your needs.
You can decide, e.g. which modules your company needs and approximately how many orders you’ll process with plentymarkets each month.
We will provide you with the necessary system performance.

You can use the “My account” area to make changes to your plentymarkets contract any time, i.e. even while the system is up and running.
It makes sense to change your contract e.g. if you generate more orders than are included in your current edition. It is possible to book a larger edition any time. If you book a smaller edition, the change will go into effect once the regular duration of your current contract has ended.

.*End of contract: Saving data*
--

Before your contract ends or you cancel it, you should think about which data you need beyond the existence of your system. Because your data is not saved automatically and thus will not be accessible anymore. With cancelling your contract you also agree that all of your data is irrevocably deleted four to six weeks after the contract ends. +
Therefore, you should for example think about which information is tax relevant and thus needed later and which legal retention obligations you have to comply with. In the following we give you an overview of possible data exports from your plentymarkets system:

[[table-end-of-contract-data-export]]
.Recommended exports when contract ends
[cols="1,3"]

|*Accounting data*
| Use the custom export in the *Data » Custom export* menu to export your financial accounting. To do so, choose the export you need from the drop-down list (e.g. *Financial accounting*) and select the appropriate settings.

|*Documents*
|Use the document archive to export relevant documents. To do so, go to the *Orders » Document archive* menu and switch to the *Export* tab. Select the appropriate settings and export all relevant documents. When selecting the documents and the time period, take legal tax requirements and retention periods into consideration.

|*Stock*

This list is a recommendation and makes no claim to be complete. If needed, create further exports for relevant information and data. If in doubt, always consult a tax advisor.

=== Viewing transactions in the clearing account

Have you bought a link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/services/setup[setup package^] offered by plentysystems on plentyMarketplace? Or does your current plentymarkets edition include a certain number of free support minutes?
In these cases, the clearing account provides an overview of the amounts and transactions that you will be billed for when plentymarkets issues the next monthly invoice. This way, you can view all transactions and your current balance resulting from the services you bought any time and without complications.

Proceed as described below to view the transactions in the clearing account.

[.instruction]
Viewing transactions in the clearing account:

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account*. +
*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +
→ The “My account” area opens in a new browser tab.
. Click on icon:credit-card-alt[role="darkGrey"] *Clearing account*. +
→ The clearing account opens. +
*_Note:_* The clearing account is only displayed if <<#50, conditions described above>> apply to you. If not, a message telling you that no clearing account is available is displayed.

The clearing account consists of two areas. The *Postings* area displays the transactions of the current invoicing period. In the *Cleared postings* area, you can find transactions that took place at an earlier point in time and that have already been set off against your balance.

[.collapseBox]
.*What do the transactions in the clearing account mean in detail?*
--

[[table-transactions-clearing-account]]
[width="100%"]
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Information |Explanation

2+| *Postings* area

| *Date*
| The date of the transaction.

| *Sub-account*
| Currently, the sub-account of the type *Support* is available. In the future, more types of sub-accounts will be added so that other billable services can be represented as well.

| *Reference*
| This field provides information on the service and the date for which an amount is either credited to or debited from the clearing account. In some plentymarkets editions, a certain contingent of support services is included per month. For these kinds of credit, the date range displayed represents the regular monthly invoicing period.

| *Amount*
| The amount of the transaction. Credited amounts are displayed in green while debited amounts are displayed in red.

2+| *Cleared postings* area

2+<| This area contains information on individual transactions that have already been cleared at past dates. The balance calculated in the course of this clearing process is displayed as a separate entry of the type “Amount carried over” in the *Postings* area. Basically, the *Cleared postings* area provides you with an overview of older transactions and the respective details. The detailed information regarding the individual transactions are listed in the same way as in the *Postings* area.
|====

--

[TIP]
.Additional functions planned
====
Our goal is to provide you with an up-to-date and transparent overview of your transactions in the clearing account. To achieve this goal, we will add further functions and display even more precise information in the near future. For example, debits will be displayed on the same date that the corresponding service has been provided to you, instead of only shortly before the current invoicing period ends. Subscribe to our link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/c/changelog[changelog^] to keep track of the upcoming changes.
====

[#370]
=== Practical example: Booking an additional online store

In plentymarkets, the term <<online-store#, client (store)>> refers to an additional online store, which is managed with the same plentymarkets system as the default store.
Existing online stores are displayed in the “My account” area. You can book additional stores as needed.

[IMPORTANT]
.Domain settings for clients (stores)
====
You need to have a <<business-decisions/system-administration/domains#, domain>> before you can order a client (store). You have to create this domain for the main system beforehand.
====

[.instruction]
Ordering a client (store):

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account*. +
*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +
→ The “My account” area opens in a new browser tab.
. Click on icon:file-text[role="darkGrey"] *Contracts*. +
→ You will see information about your current contracts.
. Click on icon:pencil[role="darkGrey"] *Edit contract*. +
→ The configurator appears.
. Make changes to the contract information as desired.

== Granting certified agencies access to the system

Open the menu *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account » Agencies* to grant certified service providers access to your system.
It makes sense to grant a service provider access to your system, e.g. if you hired a design agency to create your website or if you work with a consultant.
The service provider will be given unlimited access to your system, i.e. admin access.

[TIP]
.Decide which functions and menus should be accessible!
====
When giving an agency access to your system, you grant it unlimited, admin access.

If you would prefer to only give the agency access to specific functions or menus, <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#, create a new user account>>, e.g. a back end account, and customise its access rights.
====

[#450]
=== Granting access

Proceed as described below to grant an agency and/or consultant access to your system:

[.instruction]
Assigning service providers:

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account*. +
*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +
→ The “My account” area opens in a new browser tab.

. Click on icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] *Add* next to whichever agency should be given access to your system.

*_Note_*: You can revoke this access at any time.

[#460]
=== Withdrawing access

Would you like to permanently withdraw access for an agency? Then proceed as described below.

. Go to *plentymarkets Logo (Start) » My account*. +
*_Tip:_* To do so, point your cursor at the plentymarkets logo at the top left of the screen. +

. In the area of the agency that should be removed, click on *Remove*. +
→ A confirmation window opens.
. Click on *Remove now* to confirm your decision. +
→ System access for the selected agency is permanently withdrawn.

[IMPORTANT]
.Effective withdrawal of agency access
====
Always follow the steps described above to safely and permanently withdraw agency access to your system. It is *not* sufficient to simply <<business-decisions/user-accounts-access#85, delete the user account>> created by the agency in your plentymarkets back end.
====

[#470]
== Calling the support hotline

//tag::support-hotline[]

Do you prefer direct contact?
Our support hotline is there for you.
In the “My account” area, you can find the telephone numbers and business hours for our support hotline.
Here you can also find your support PIN.
You will need to enter it when you call the hotline.

[.instruction]
Calling the support hotline:

. Go to icon:question-circle[role="darkGrey"] *» Consulting*. +
→ The “My account” area opens in a new browser tab and information about the support hotline is displayed.
