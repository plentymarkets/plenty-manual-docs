== Legally secure working with plentymarkets

According to GoBD (German regulation), sellers are, among other things, obliged to describe the procedure of the software they are using. This has to be done in form of a procedural documentation which has to be submitted in case of a tax audit. We support plentymarkets users in creating a procedural documentation by providing a technical system documentation. This documentation includes the detailed breakdown of all working methods of plentymarkets relevant in terms of tax law that can be used as a basis for a procedural documentation.

Note that the system documentation provided here is only a *template* for creating a procedural documentation. Read the system documentation carefully and add specific information on your company and your workflow with your plentymarkets system.
