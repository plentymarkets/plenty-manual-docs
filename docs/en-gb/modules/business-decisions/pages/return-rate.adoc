:key-figure: Return rate

include::partial$key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentymarkets calculates the return rate by dividing the total number of credit notes and returns by the total number of all the order types except credit notes and returns: +
_(∑ Credit notes + ∑ Returns) : Number of all other order types = Return rate_ +
By choosing a xref:business-decisions:return-rate.adoc#100[calculation type], you decide whether to calculate the return rate or the return rate amount.
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:return-rate.adoc#200[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:return-rate.adoc#300[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the return rate.

[IMPORTANT]
.Information on return rate calculation
====
Do you want to use this key figure to calculate the precise return rate? Then it is mandatory to set the filter for the order type *Return* when creating the key figure. If this is not done, credit notes will be considered for the calculation as outlined in the formula above. This leads to inaccurate results.

== Calculation

=== Return rate

The number of returns is divided by the number of order types which are not credit notes and returns.
Note that you have to set the filter *Order type* with the selection *Order* and *Return*.

=== Return rate amount

The return rate amount is calculated by summing up the gross amounts of all credit notes and returns. This result is then divided by the total gross amount of all other order types: +
_(∑ gross amounts credit notes \+ ∑ gross amounts returns) : gross total other order types = Return rate amount_ +
Note that you have to set the filter *Order type* with the selection credit note and return.
