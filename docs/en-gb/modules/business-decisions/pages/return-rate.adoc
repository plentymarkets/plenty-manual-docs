:key-figure: Return rate

include::partial$key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentymarkets calculates the key figure *Return rate* by dividing the total number of credit notes and returns by the total number of all the order types except credit notes and returns: +
_(∑ Credit notes + Returns) : Number of all other order types = Return rate_ +
By choosing a xref:business-decisions:return-rate.adoc#100[calculation type], you decide whether to calculate the return rate or the return rate amount.
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:return-rate.adoc#200[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:return-rate.adoc#300[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the return rate.

[#100]
== Calculation type

=== Return rate

The return rate is calculated as described in the introduction: The number of credit notes and returns is divided by the amount of order types which are not credit notes and returns.
Note that you have to set the filter *Order type* with the selection credit note and return.

=== Return rate amount

The return rate amount is calculated by summing up the gross amounts of all credit notes and returns. This result is then divided by the total gross amount of all other order types: +
_(∑ gross amounts credit notes + ∑ gross amounts returns) : gross toal other order types = Return rate amount_ +
Note that you have to set the filter *Order type* with the selection credit note and return.
