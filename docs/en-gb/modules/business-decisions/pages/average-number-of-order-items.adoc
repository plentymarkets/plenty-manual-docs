:key-figure: Average number of order items

include::partial$key-figure-introduction.adoc[]

plentymarkets calculates the average number of order items by summing up the quantity of order items of the order.
This result is then divided by the total number of orders: +
_(∑ Order items) : Order quantity = ø Number of order items_ +
In addition, select a xref:business-decisions:average-number-of-order-items.adoc#100[dimension] to determine how the result is grouped.
Set xref:business-decisions:average-number-of-order-items.adoc#200[filters] to specify the criteria for the calculation of the average number of order items.
