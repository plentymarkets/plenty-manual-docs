|New serial numbers
a|Should it be possible to scan serial numbers that were not previously saved in your <<item/use-cases/serial-numbers#, pool of serial numbers in the item data record>>?

** *_Pro_*: This method can save time since the serial numbers don't need to be saved in advance.

* *Do not permit* = A serial number can only be scanned if it exists in the item data record.

|Save automatically
| **Yes** = The process will be saved once serial numbers have been registered for all of the stock units. The process will continue automatically. +

=== Save to clipboard

It can take a long time to print or save a large number of documents. This can cause unnecessary delays while running a process. Use the **Save to clipboard** sub-procedure to avoid such delays. For example, you can use it before a procedure that takes longer to carry out than it does to save. The information will be saved in the background while the procedure is carried out. You can follow this e.g. by the **Print** sub-procedure. The printer will access and print the documents that were saved in the background.

[NOTE]
.Do not combine with a procedure used for handing errors
====
Do not use **Save to clipboard** together with a procedure that is used for handing errors. Because documents are cached asynchronously, this combination would hinder the processes from being carried out correctly.
