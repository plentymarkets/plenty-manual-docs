== Adding a procedure/control element to a work step

Proceed as described below to add a procedure or a control element to a work step.

[.instruction]
Adding a procedure or a control element to a work step:

. Go to *Setup » Processes » [Select folder] » [Select process]*.
. Point your cursor over whichever work step you want to add the procedure or the control element to. +
→ The context menu for the work step opens.
. Click on *Add*. +
→ The *Add* window appears.
. Choose the procedure or the control element from the drop-down list. +
Carry out additional settings as desired. Note the information in the <<automation/processes/procedures#, index of procedures and control elements>>.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The procedure or control element will be created.
. Point your cursor over the procedure or control element if you want to edit the *Position* or any other settings.

[TIP]
.Use the context menu
====
If the work step already includes a procedure, then you can use the context menu to add additional procedures or control elements. Simply right-click on a procedure and select *Insert procedure before* or *Insert procedure after*.
====

== Index of procedures and control elements

The control elements and procedures are listed in alphabetical order. You can find the following information for each control element/procedure:

* Short description of the control element/procedure
* Which work steps the control element/procedure is available for
* Additional settings that are available for this control element/procedure
* For procedures: Which procedures are available in case of error
* For procedures: Which sub-procedures are available for the procedure

This page serves as a reference for users who already have a basic understanding of plentymarkets processes. If you’re looking for basic information about processes, refer to the <<automation/processes/setting-up-processes#, Setting up processes>> page of the manual.

=== Control elements

This chapter deals with the control elements that can be configured for processes. You can use control elements to determine how individual procedures should interact with each other within a work step.

[#480]
==== General settings for control elements

Some settings are available for every control element. <<table-control-elements-general-settings>> describes these settings. The settings **Show** and **Destination** are not available for every control element. However, they are also described here. You can check whether or not the settings are available for a given control element by reading the explanations further below.

[[table-control-elements-general-settings]]
.Information about the general settings for control elements
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| **Position**
|This option is only visible once the control element has been created. +
The procedure's current position in the work step. The procedure with the lowest position number is run first. Use the drop-down list to change the position number if you want the procedures to run in a different order. +
**__Tip:__** Procedures can also be moved using the context menu. To do so, right-click the procedure and select **Move up** or **Move down**.

| **Show**
|Decide whether the procedure should be displayed in the work step. +
**Yes** (default setting) = Procedure is shown in the **Processes** menu. +
**No** = Procedure is not shown in the **Processes** menu. The procedure runs in the background.

| **Destination**
|Choose which procedure the control element should jump to. You can choose any of the procedures within the work step. +
**__Tip:__** You can tell procedures apart by their IDs. The ID is displayed in parenthesis after the procedure’s name. Point your cursor over a procedure to see its ID in the upper left corner.
|====

[#490]
==== Dialogue

Use the **Dialogue** control element to ask your employees a question. Depending on how they answer, the process will then jump to a specific point.

Learn about the control element in our playful tutorial:

.Dialogue control element
video::227218743[vimeo]

Similar to the control element Split, the process can continue in one of several different ways.

You can individually customise the question that you ask your employees. Not only can you give it a title, but you can also write a message and give your employees different options to choose from.
For example, you can use the Dialogue control element to ask your employees which shipping service provider they’re using for the order. The various services will then be displayed as buttons. The user clicks on one of the buttons to select the appropriate service.

[.subhead]
Work steps

This control element can be selected for the following work steps:

* <<automation/processes/work-steps#order-group-processing, Order group processing>>

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+| *Settings*

| *Mode*
|Decide how the order search should work. +
*Default* = The procedure searches for orders _and_ their corresponding returns, credit notes, delivery orders, etc. For example, if the warehouse technician enters an order ID into the search field, then he’ll see the order and its corresponding return in the list of results. +
*Ignore order relations* = The procedure _only_ searches for exact matches. For example, if the warehouse technician enters an order ID into the search field, then he’ll _only_ see the order in the list of results. The corresponding return will not be includes in the search results. +
*Box search* = Is used for <<app/functions/warehouse-management/mobile-box-picking#, box picking>>. The warehouse technician scans a storage location’s barcode. plentymarkets loads the corresponding order.

2+| *Input fields*

| **Order ID**; +
**Package number**; +
**Customer ID**; **Invoice number**; +
**Customer number**; +
*External delivery note number*
|Decide whether this search field should be displayed during the process. In other words, decide whether users should be able to search by this criteria. In other words, you can search for orders by their order ID and by other parameters such as the invoice number.

| **Automatic focus**
|Decide which search field your cursor should start out in when you run the process. This allows you to directly scan or type into the search field without having to select it beforehand.

2+| *Filter*

| **Loyalty program**
|Select one, several or no loyalty program to only process orders from this loyalty program or orders without a loyalty program.

| **Order type display**
|Place check marks next to all of the different order types that should be found. If an order type is not selected, then it will not be displayed in the results, even if the user entered data that otherwise would have been a match.  +
*_Important:_* Order types that are to be further processed need to have a check mark placed for them in the option **Order type selection**.

| **Order type selection**
|Place check marks next to whichever order types you want the ability to select and process further in the next steps.

| **Item table columns**
|Decide which columns should be displayed in the list of items found by the order search.

| **Skip list if only one match**
|Applies if the search result only consists of one order of the type selected under **Order type selection**. +
**Yes** = The order that was found will directly be processed further.  +
**No** = As with search results that include more than one order, the order will first have to be selected with a check mark before it is processed further.

| **Include coupon order items (ID -1)**
|Coupon redemptions are shown as separate coupon order items with the ID -1 in orders. Decide whether coupon order items (ID -1) should be shown in procedures like *Create/edit return* and *Item registration*. +
*Yes* = Coupon order items (ID -1) will be shown.
*No* = Coupon order items (ID -1) will not be shown.

2+| *Shortcuts*

| **Next stock unit**;  +
**Next order**;  +
**Edit order**; +
**Back to search**
|Shortcuts allow you to carry out specific commands while running a process. All you need to do is enter the corresponding key sequences.

==== Serial numbers

Every time you sell an item with a <<item/use-cases/serial-numbers#, serial number>>, plentymarkets should keep a record of _which copy_ was sold. In other words, plentymarkets should keep track of which serial number matches which order. This can be done by using the *Serial numbers* procedure together with the <<automation/processes/sub-procedures#260, Register serial numbers>> sub-procedure.

Your warehouse technician simply scans the serial number while picking the item in the warehouse. The serial number is automatically assigned to the order. The serial number also automatically appears on the customer's invoice.

[IMPORTANT]
