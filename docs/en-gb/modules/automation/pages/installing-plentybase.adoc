== Installing plentyBase

Before you install plentyBase, make sure that the general <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-system-requirements#, system requirements>> that also apply to your regular plentymarkets system are fulfilled.

You can find the installation files for plentyBase in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentybase_5053[plentyMarketplace^]. Select your operating system from the drop-down list the right side before clicking on *Free download*.

Then, install plentyBase on your computer just as you would any other program. Since the installation process differs depending on your operating system, only plentyBase specific settings are described in the following.

[.instruction]
Installing plentyBase:

. Run the installation file.
. During the installation process, select the HTTPS port for communication between the computer and plentyBase for the option *Enter a HTTPS port above 1023*. +
*_Note:_* The HTTPS port 7331 is selected by default because it is free on most computers. Only change this default value if the port 7331 is already in use on your computer. +
*_Tip:_* Open the command line and use one of the following commands to see which ports of your computer are already in use:
    * Windows: netstat -ano | find/i “listening” +
    * Mac OSX: sudo lsof -i -P | grep -i LISTEN +
*_Note:_* If you want to connect plentyBase to the plentymarkets app to print plentyPOS receipts using a local printer, activate the option *Add HTTP server with the following port:* and enter an HTTP port.  The HTTP port 7332 is selected by default because it is free on most computers. Only change this default value if the port 7332 is already in use on your computer.

[#400]
== Limiting access to local directories via plentyBase

By default, plentyBase has access on all directories of your computer. Do you want to restrict access to specific directories? If so, proceed as described below to grant access to selected directories only. As a result, all directories on your computer that you have not selected will be automatically blocked for access via plentyBase.

. To grant access to all subdirectories of the directory, activate the check box in the *Subdirectories* column.
. Add additional directories as necessary.
. Click on *OK* to save the settings. +
→ plentyBase can now only access the directories activated in the *Access* column.

[#500]
== Granting plentyBase access to additional domains

plentyBase provides an interface between plentymarkets and the computer on which plentyBase is installed. To prevent unauthorised access, plentyBase can only access the local computer via the following plentymarkets domains:

* `plentymarkets-cloud-de.com` 
* `plentymarkets-cloud-ie.com`

Additional domains must be specified in the plentyBase settings. To do so, proceed as described below.

. Click on *OK* to save the settings.

[#600]
== Making plentyBase available in a network

You can install plentyBase on one computer of a network and make it available for other computers within the same network. To use plentyBase within a network, the IP address and the host name of the computer on which plentyBase is installed need to be saved in the HOSTS files of the other computers in the network.

[#610]
=== Installing plentyBase on a network computer

* First, <<#200, install plentyBase>> on a computer within the network.
* Write down the IP-address of the host computer on which plentyBase is installed.
* *_Note:_* We recommend assigning a static IP address to the host computer.
* If you did not use the default HTTPS port 7331, also write down the HTTPS port number you entered during installation.

[#620]
=== Saving IP data in HOSTS file of other network computers

The HOSTS file is a local text file of the operating system in which host names are assigned to specific IP addresses.  In the HOSTS file of the client computer, you enter the IP address and host name of the computer in the network on which plentyBase is installed. This way, the client computer can access plentyBase. You need admin rights to edit the HOSTS file of the client computer.

[WARNING]
.Edit the HOSTS file at your own risk
====
The HOSTS file is an important system file. You edit this file at your own risk. plentymarkets does not assume any guarantee or liability for any damages, subsequent damages or loss that may be caused by modifying the HOSTS file. Also note the following:

* Before editing the host file, create a backup copy of the host file.
* Do not delete or edit existing entries in the HOSTS file.
====

The process of editing the HOSTS file differs according to the operating system that you are using. Click on the appropriate tab to view instructions for your operating system.
