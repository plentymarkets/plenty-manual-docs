== Why you should use processes

Similar to xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedures], processes help you to automate complex workflows in your plentymarkets system. However, processes allow you to automatically print order documents or shipping labels and, depending on the workflow at hand, include user dialogues including different options. To use the processes, the tool link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/externe-tools/plentyBase_5053/[plentyBase^] has to be installed and running on your local computer.
