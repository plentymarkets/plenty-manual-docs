== Why you should use processes

Similar to <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedures>>, processes help you to automate complex workflows in your plentymarkets system. However, processes allow you to automatically print order documents or shipping labels and, depending on the workflow at hand, include user dialogues including different options. To use the processes, the tool link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/externe-tools/plentyBase_5053/[plentyBase^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] has to be installed and running on your local computer.

== How are processes set up?

As soon as you have installed and started link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/externe-tools/plentyBase_5053/[plentyBase^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] on your local computer, you are ready to go.

Go to *Setup » Processes » New process* to set up a new process. Refer to the <<automation/processes/setting-up-processes#, Setting up processes>> page of the manual for more information on how to set up processes.

You can access and run the processes you have already set up any time. Click on *Processes* in the upper menu bar of the plentymarkets back end to do so. The manual page on <<automation/processes/carrying-out-processes#, running processes>> describes the necessary steps to run processes.
