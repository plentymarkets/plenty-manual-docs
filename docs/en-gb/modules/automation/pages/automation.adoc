== Procedure manager

In plentymarkets, you can use the xref:automation:procedure-manager.adoc#[procedure manager] to automatically complete routine tasks at a specific time every day.

For example, you can xref:automation:best-practices-automation.adoc#_practical_examples_procedure_manager[use the procedure manager] to set a time each day when non-paying eBay or store customers should receive a payment reminder or dunning letter. The reminder will then be automatically sent by email.

== Event procedures

xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[Event procedures] are easy to understand: specific *_events_* in your online store trigger specific *_procedures_*.

For example, you can xref:automation:best-practices-automation.adoc#_practical_examples_event_procedures[use event procedures] to send emails to your customers. Use event procedures to configure such automatic tasks and have plentymarkets complete them reliably.
