Your daily business as a seller mostly consists of simple routine tasks. plentymarkets offers you different effective tools to automate such tasks. +
This page of the manual contains practical examples for setting up *Event procedures* and the *Procedure manager*.

[IMPORTANT]
.Requirements for automation
====
Some of the sample procedures on this page send email templates or generate particular order documents. Thus, make sure that the respective *email templates* have been set up correctly in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* menu. In addition, the respective document templates have to be set up before setting up and using procedures that create documents. Document templates are set up in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents* menu.
====

== Practical examples: Event procedures

The basic principle of event procedures is easy to understand: In case of an event procedure, certain *Events* that occur in the online shop trigger specific *Procedures*. Precise instructions on setting up event procedures and the available events, filters and procedures can be found on the <<automation/event-procedures#, Event procedures>> page of the manual. +
Below, you can find a lit of examples for automatic procedures that are triggered by event procedures.

=== Generating and sending an invoice

If you want your plentymarkets system to automatically generate an invoice as soon as outgoing items have been booked for the corresponding order, we recommend the event procedure described in <<table-event-procedure-generate-invoice>>.

[WARNING]
.Generating a document using an event procedure
====
The following event procedure only triggers the generation of the invoice document. Set up the second event procedure described below to send the invoice document to your customers as a PDF file attached to an email. If you use one and the same event procedure to generate and send documents, it can happen that the email is sent before the invoice document has been created. Thus, we generally recommend to set up two separate event procedures for generating and sending order documents.

=== Sending shipping confirmations to customers

If you want to send a shipping confirmation to your customers as soon as the package number of the consignment has been imported into your plentymarkets system, we recommend the event procedure described in <<table-event-procedure-shipping-confirmation>>. This event procedure will move the order to status 7 and book outgoing items in your warehouse so that physical stock is reduced accordingly.

[TIP]
.Display tracking URL in shipping confirmation
====
Almost all shipping service providers offer your customers the possibility to track their deliveries online. You already saved a tracking URL while setting up your shipping service providers. Once the package number has been entered, your plentymarkets system has all necessary information to send customers a tracking URL for their packages. Use this option and make sure that the shipping confirmation email template contains the variable *$TrackingURL*. We recommend that you test the first tracking URLs for yourself to ensure that they have been processed correctly and that all necessary information are displayed for the customer.
====

=== Setting up the postcode filter

In this chapter, we describe the postcode filter a little closer  and give you an example of how you might set up an event procedure for it.

==== How does the postcode filter work?

The postcode filter was added to the filters of the <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedures>> to check the postcode in the  *delivery address* of an order. A comparison of the entered values and the postcode in the delivery address will be done, starting with the first character and proceeding to the next.

This means putting `W1U` in this field will result in the event procedure working for e.g. `W1U 6AG`, `W1S 2XG` and `W1T 1BX`. You might enter multiple values separated by a comma as `W1U, SE` if multiple regions are to be considered.

==== What do you need to set up?

Depending on your workflow in processing orders, some settings are useful such as activating ‘special’ delivery countries you are delivering to (Isle of Man, Canary Islands).

To us it makes sense to create a new order status because you will be able to set filters in other menus regarding it.

In the following example, we created a new status in the *Setup » Orders » Status* menu named *Check delivery address* in advance.

.New order status
image::automation/assets/Postcode-filter-new_order_status.png[width=640, height=360]

We frequently get orders with shipment to ‘special’ countries which need to be processed in another way as for customs reasons or because the shipping costs are much higher for us.

Las Palmas is such an example: The postcodes of the Canary Islands start with `35` or `38`. Politically, they belong to Spain but are an autonomous community with most likely higher shipping costs compared to costs for shipping to mainland Spain.

To create our new event procedure, we go to *Setup » Orders » Events* and create a new event procedure that we name “Postcode filter”.

The event *Status change* is most appropriate for us because all our orders have to go through the status *In preparation for shipping*.

Next, we add a new filter by clicking on icon:plus-square[role="green"] and select *Postcodes* in the *Order* folder.

.Postcode filter
image::automation/assets/Postcode-filter-add-filter.png[width=640, height=360]

Entering `35, 38` in the filter field will do a check for postcodes beginning with `35` or `38`. In addition to this, we add the filter *Shipping > Country of delivery* and activate *Spain* because other countries do not need this check.

After that, we add the procedure *Change status* in the *Order* folder and select the order status “Check delivery address” that we created in advance.


.New event procedure
image::automation/assets/Postcode-filter-filter-and-procedures.png[width=640, height=360]

Now the event procedure checks in all new orders that are in status *In preparation for shipping*, if they should be sent to Spain and if the postcode fits in the filter.

There are 2 possible scenarios:

1. The filters in the event procedure do not fit with the order. +
  → The event procedure does not have any impact on the order.
2. The filters in the event procedure do fit with the order. +
  → The event procedure is processed and the order status will be changed to *Check delivery address*.


[TIP]
.Further options for the use of this filter
====
Of course, more filters can be used with the postcode filter. You can add, for example, a referrer or order types to have finer distinction in the event procedures. You know best, what you need.
====

== Practical examples: Procedure manager

You can use the procedure manager to set up automatic processes that carry out procedures daily at fixed times. In contrast to event procedures, procedures handled by the procedure manager are not triggered by specific events, but take place automatically after a certain span of time has passed. For example, you can use a daily interval to send an automatic payment reminder to customers who have not paid for their orders within the previous 7 days. +
For detailed instructions on setting up the procedure manager and on the available filters and procedures, refer to the <<automation/procedure-manager#, Procedure manager>> page of the manual.

=== Sending a payment reminder

If you want to remind customers who have placed orders with the payment method *Cash in advance* of outstanding payments, use the procedure described in <<table-procedure-manager-reminder>>. When carrying out the settings, pay attention to the fact that orders with the payment method *Cash in advance* are automatically assigned the status *[3]Waiting for payment* in your plentymarkets system.

[[table-procedure-manager-reminder]]
.Setting up the procedure “Sending a payment reminder”
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Tab |Setting

| *Settings*
|Use the option *Execute every day at* to specify when the procedure should be carried out. Enter a *Name* and select the option *Active*.

| *Filter*
|For the *Status* option, select the status *Waiting for payment*. Select *Enter the days* for the *Last status change* setting and enter the number of days into the text field below. Enter the number *7* in the *Days* field. +
With this setting, all orders that have been in status *[3] Waiting for payment* for exactly seven days are found.

| *Procedure*
|For the option *Send email template*, select the *email template* previously created for this purpose, for example the template *Order: Payment reminder*.
|====

[TIP]
.Tip: Several variations of the procedure
====
We recommend to set up this procedure several times with slight variations. For example, an additional email with another reminder can be sent a few days later. After even more days have passed without incoming payment, another procedure can be set up which moves the status to *8* and thus cancels the order. This status change also releases the stock that has previously been reserved for the order.
====

=== Starting a dispute process on eBay

It is also possible to use the procedure manager to automatically start dispute processes on eBay. The customer then receives a request for payment via eBay. We recommend to select the filters similarly to the ones used in the procedure *Sending a payment reminder* in the example described above. In addition to the filter settings, select the procedure *eBay: Start dispute process*.

The dispute process is intended for orders for which payment is outstanding for more than 4 days. In plentymarkets, these orders are referred to as *outstanding orders*. Those orders are listed and can be imported in the <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#7300, Setup » Markets » eBay » Data exchange>> menu. Outstanding orders have to be imported before the dispute process can be started with the procedure manager.

Use the procedure described in <<table-procedure-manager-ebay-dispute>> to automatically start dispute processes.

[[table-procedure-manager-ebay-dispute]]
.Setting up the procedure “Starting a dispute process on eBay”

|Tab |Setting

| *Settings*
|Use the option *Execute every day at* to specify when the procedure should be carried out. Enter a *Name* and select the option *Active*.

| *Filter*
|For the *Status* option, select the status *Incomplete data*. Select *Enter the days* for the *Last status change* setting and enter the number of days into the text field below. Enter the number *10* in the *Days* field. +
Thus, all orders that have been in the status *[1] Incomplete data* for exactly 10 days are found.

| *Procedure*
|For the option *eBay*, select *Start dispute process*.
|====

=== Automatically posting feedback on eBay

The procedure manager enables you to automatically post positive feedback for customers who have provided you with positive feedback as well. For this procedure, it is necessary to create a corresponding procedure in the *Procedure manager* and save *feedback texts*. This procedure is the only one in the procedure manager that is triggered by an event and not at a specified point in time. Refer to the <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#1300, eBay>> page of the manual for further information.
