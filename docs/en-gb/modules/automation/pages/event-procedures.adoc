:description: Learn how to automate your daily tasks by using event procedures. Moreover, find out how to create, activate and edit event procedures.

Order processing mostly consists of routine tasks. To a large extent, you can let your plentymarkets system take care of these tasks. In particular, sending emails to your customer is a time-consuming tasks, but nonetheless a vital aspect of a service- and customer-oriented online shop.
With the *Event procedures*, plentymarkets provides you with an efficient tool for setting up such automatic processes that are reliably managed by your plentymarkets system. +
The basic principle of event procedures is simple: Certain *events* that occur in your online shop trigger specific *procedures*. You can use this for example to send order confirmations. To automatically send an order confirmation to the customer as soon as a new order is placed, you can create an event procedure in which the event *New order* is followed by the procedure *Send email*. With the help of the *Filter* function, you can define for which of the new orders emails should be sent.

Creating an event procedure always consists of the following steps:

. <<#100, Creating an event procedure>>
. <<#110, Selecting an event>>
. <<#120, Adding one or multiple filters>>
. Determining which <<#130, Procedures>> should be carried out by the system once the selected event takes place
. <<#200, Activating>> the event procedure

Once an event procedure was applied to an order, the same event procedure is not applied again to the same order. On the other hand, during order processing several different event procedures can be applied to the same order.

For practical examples of how to use event procedures effectively, refer to the xref:automation:best-practices-automation.adoc#[Practical example: Procedure manager and event procedures] page of the manual.

[#100]
== Creating a new event procedure

Go to *Setup » Orders » Events* to create a new event procedure. In this menu, you can also view the already existing event procedures and xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#300[edit] them.

=== Adding filters

After selecting an event that triggers the event procedure, select a *Filter* or multiple filters. Filters determine which orders are affected by the event procedure. The available filters are grouped into orders, just as the events are. The available filters are described below according to their filter groups.

It is possible to select several filters for the same event procedure. In that case, the filters are applied one after the other. Therefore, make sure to add the filters in the correct order. Thus, only orders that match all selected filters are affected by the event procedure.

[.instruction]
Adding a filter:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Events*.
. Click on the event procedure to which you want add a filter to.
. Click on *Add filter* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) in the filter area.
. Select the appropriate *Filter type* from the corresponding filter group.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Configure the settings in the filter as needed, if it is a filter with additional settings.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Some filters have additional settings. Therefore, select the required settings after adding the filter. For example, you can select specific order types to which the event procedure is applied for the filter *Order type*. After editing, the settings have to be saved (icon:save[role="green"]). Note that this saves the event procedure but does not activate it. For this, additionally the option *Active* has to be selected. Activate the event procedure only after all settings and a logical check of the settings have been made.

|The procedure xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#intable-splitting-orders[splits the orders] according to xref:item:availabilities.adoc#[item availabilities] into orders. Create *Availability groups* for the filtered orders. To do so, drag one or more of the availabilities to the right and create the first group. To create a second group, drag further availabilities to icon:plus-square[role="green"]. If needed, create more groups.
When items with an availability from one of the groups are included in an order, a new order per group is created. +
_Note_ that you have to have at least two groups for splitting to take place.

| *Split by available line of items*
|The procedure splits orders according to a selectable xref:item:attributes.adoc#[attribute] and available stock. The order is split if different variations of an item have been ordered and not all variations are available. Items that are immediately available remain in the original order. Delivery orders will be created for items that have missing variations.

| *Split by delivery date*
|Orders are automatically split into orders according to the delivery date saved in the order. The customer can enter the delivery date during the checkout process. It is also possible to save or change the delivery date of order items in the order itself. In addition, you can use a group function to assign delivery dates to orders.

| *Change order type*
|The procedure changes the order type of an order. The options *Order* or *Advance order* are available.

| *Change status*
|The procedure changes the order type of an order. Select the order status the orders should get after the event procedure is applied from the drop-down list. +
*Ignore delivery orders*: The procedure *Change status* changes the status of both the main order and its xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#300[delivery orders] by default.

The procedure can be added more than once so that tags can be added and deleted within the same event procedure, if necessary. +

| *Change dunning level*
|The procedure changes the dunning level of an order. Select the dunning level that should be applied from the drop-down list.

| *Change status of main order*
|The procedure changes the order type of a main order. Select the order status from the drop-down list which the main order should get after splitting an order (option *Split up* in the order menu) or after delivery orders are generated.

| *Calculate sales data for data export*
|Revenue data is usually stored in a separate database to maintain a high level of system performance during the generation of invoices or credit notes. Because it is not allowed to generate internal invoices for certain payment methods, such as *Neckermann* or *Quelle*, this database does not contain any data for orders with these payment methods. However, you can use this procedure to generate export data for those orders (Collmex, DATEV etc.) with the help of an event procedure. +
_Important:_ The procedure is only carried out if the payment method of the order is *Quelle*, *Klarna* or *Neckermann*. Thus, these payment methods should be selected in the filter of the event procedure.

| *Open URL*
|The procedure opens a URL provided within the procedure. The URL can be used to transmit information on orders. For example, the order ID can be included by attaching the template variable *OrderID* to the URL. The URL has to be entered in its full length and according to the template *+https://www.example.co.uk+*. +
Example including the attached order ID: *+https://www.example.co.uk/[OrderID]/+*. +
The available template variables are listed within the procedure. +
*HTTP method* = Select *GET*, *PUT* or *POST*. +
*Content type* = Save the content type for the URL. +
*Example*: If XML content should be transferred, enter *text/xml*. +
*Request Content* = Texts, for example XML or JSON content can be transferred.

| *Assign sales representative to order*
|The procedure saves a sales representative in an order. The sales representative is assigned according to the postcode of the address linked to the recipient of the order. For a sales representative to be assigned, it is mandatory that a range of postcodes is saved in the representative’s contact data.
