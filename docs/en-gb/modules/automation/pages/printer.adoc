== Configuring printers with different paper trays (Windows only)

If you own a printer with different paper trays and you want to work with different paper sizes, you can set up a printer profile for each paper tray.

[TIP]
.Example configuration for different formats
====
You want to print invoices in DIN A4 format and labels in DIN A6 format.

Set up a printer profile with the paper size DIN A4 and another printer profile with the paper size DIN A6. Select the same printer for both profiles and assign the corresponding paper tray to each paper size.
====

[#30]
== Sharing printers

Printer profiles are saved for each individual user account on a computer. As such, they are not available for other users who share the same computer. If a printer profile should be available for other users as well, then the profile must be shared with others. Profiles are shared on your computer, not in plentymarkets. Use your operating system's help function to find out how to share printers on your computer:

* Help for Windows e.g. link:http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/share-printer#1TC=windows-7[here^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]
* Help for Mac e.g. link:https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204135[here^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]

== Printing labels

With special label printers you can print large numbers of labels in no time. These printers are equipped with label reels. Some models even have an integrated cutter. Save the exact label size using the **Paper size** option in the **Setup » Settings » Printer** menu. You can either select one of the default formats or define your won sizes using the custom option described in <<table-add-base-printer>>.

All printing functions are compatible with label printers and are especially optimised for using label printers produced by link:https://www.zebra.com/gb/en.html[Zebra^]. For use as a desktop printer, we recommend the model link:https://www.zebra.com/gb/en/products/printers/desktop/value-desktop-printers.html[Zebra GC420d^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

[#60]
=== Installing the Zebra GC420d on your computer

Proceed as described below to install the Zebra GC420d on the operating systems Windows or Mac OSX.

[.instruction]
Installing the Zebra GC420d:

. First, download the link:https://www.zebra.com/gb/en/support-downloads/desktop/gx430t.html#mainpartabscontainer_999b=drivers[Zebra Setup Utilities^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] file to your computer.
. Install the file.
. Follow the instructions in the setup wizard. +
→ Windows: Select the ZDesigner GC420d printer. Here, the ZPL printer driver is used by default. +
→ Mac OSX: Select the printer driver ZPL. Test the driver's setting for every label size individually. To use the **ZPL** printer plugin, configure your Zebra printer for <<automation/processes/printer#65, RAW printing>>.

[#65]
=== Setting up a Zebra printer with the ZPL plugin (Mac OSX only)

To optimise print quality with the ZPL plugin on Mac OSX systems, you need to enable the Zebra printer for print jobs in RAW format. When printing in RAW format, print data is sent in the printer's native language. The print data remains unchanged because the operating system's print driver is bypassed.

To configure RAW printing, you need to access the CUPS web interface. Proceed as described below to activate the CUPS web interface and configure the printer.

[.instruction]
ZPL plugin: Activating the CUPS web interface (Mac OSX only):

. Open the Spotlight search by pressing "cmd" + "Leertaste".
. Enter the term **Terminal**.

=== Configuring label printing

Configure the height and width of your labels in plentymarkets. First, add the label printer to your printer list. To do so, proceed as follows. The configuration is described based on a label format of 104 x 150.

[.instruction]
Adding a printer for 104 x 150 labels:

. Go to **Setup » Settings » Printer**.
. Click on the context menu in the menu structure. +
→ The **New printer** button is displayed.
. Click on **New printer**. +
→ The configuration menu opens.
. Enter a name.
. Select the label printer from the drop-down list **Printer**.
. Select **do not open** from the **Printer dialogue** drop-down list.
. Select **Invalid selection** from the **Paper tray** drop-down list.
. Select **Custom** from the **Paper size** drop-down list.
. Enter **150** as the **Paper height**.
. Enter **104** as the **Paper width**.
. Do not change the one-sided setting for double-sided printing.
. Select **Fit to page (ignore aspect ratio)** from the **Scaling** drop-down list.
. Select **portrait** from the **Orientation** drop-down list.
. **Save** the settings.

[TIP]
.Tip for multiple label sizes
====
If you use different label sizes, you can either change the paper height and width in the printer dialogue when changing the label or set up an individual printer for each label size.
====

[#80]
=== Correcting label printing errors

If the printing results are slightly offset, but visible on the label, we recommend that you correct the printing position using the **Top**, **Left**, **Bottom** and **Right** fields.

If only a small part of the information is printed and the rest of the label is empty, change the printer's driver. Using the right driver is crucial for printing correctly. This is especially true for Apple computers, but it can also be a cause of errors for Windows computers.  +
For Windows, we recommend that you install the printer ZDesigner GC420d and the driver ZPL. In some cases, you may obtain better results using the printer ZDesigner GC420d (EPL) and the EPL driver.

If you were able to correct the printing results, add a printer with the right settings for the label. This way, you can reuse the settings. We recommend installing the same printer multiple times using different drivers, so that you can switch to another configuration quickly if the labels aren't printed correctly.

Incorrect printing results may also occur if the process uses the label parameters of your label printer instead of the label settings in plentymarkets. In this case, it may help to add the label parameters in your printer settings.

In plentymarkets, you can also select different printer plugins. If the print quality is not satisfactory, experiment by printing test labels with different printer plugins.

[#90]
== Displaying the print history

The print history displays your print orders from the past 14 days. After these 14 days, entries will be deleted from the print history. Print orders are stored temporarily in order to forward them to the printer. As soon as a print order has been saved temporarily, it is listed in the print history. This also means that print orders that were not actually printed may be listed in the print history, e.g. if the paper tray was empty or if other problems occurred with the printer.

[.instruction]
Displaying the print history:

. Go to **Data » Print history**. +
→ The print history opens.

You can print documents again within the print history or delete print orders from the history. 20 entries are displayed per page by default as soon as you open the print history. You can also display 50 or 100 entries per page. Place a check mark next to the print orders that you want to delete or reprint. You can select all print orders displayed on a page or select them individually.

[#100]
== Deleting a printer

Proceed as described below to delete a printer.

[.instruction]
Deleting a printer:

. Go to **Setup » Settings » Printer**.
. Click on the printer. +
→ The configuration menu opens.
. Click on **Delete**. +
→ The printer is deleted.
