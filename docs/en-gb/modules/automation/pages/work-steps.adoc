:description: Learn how to set up the work steps order group processing, single order processing and incoming items for processes. Moreover, find out which procedures and sub-procedures are available.

This manual page deals with the work steps that can be set up for processes. You can create and configure as many work steps as you want for a process.

Depending on which type of work step you select, there are different settings and options to choose from. These primarily consist of procedures and sub-procedures that are carried out one after the other and can either run endlessly or be controlled manually. You can also select filters that allow you to carry out very individual settings for work steps.

Watch the following video to learn more about work steps.

.plentyBase required
====
To create and run processes, you need the tool xref:automation:installing-plentybase.adoc#[plentyBase]. You can download the installation files for plentyBase in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentyBase_5053[plentyMarketplace^].
====

Select the type of work step when you create a new work step.

Click on *Add* and carry out the settings as described in the following sub-chapters.

[#order-group-processing]
== Order group processing

The *Order group processing* work step determines to which and how many orders the process is applied. Start out by choosing filters to specify which exact orders should be included in the process. Then decide how you want to change the orders that have finished being processed. Change the order status, owner and/or flag so that you never accidentally process the same order twice. Lastly, decide which order should be processed first, second, third, etc.

[#order-group-processing-creation]
=== Creation

First create a work step.

[.instruction]
Creating a work step:

. Click on *New work step*.
. Select the type *Order group processing*.
. Click on *Save*. +
→ The settings window opens.

If you have already created a work step, click on *Edit* to open this window.

[#order-group-processing-settings]
==== Settings

Use this area to save general settings for the work step. For example, save a name and decide where the work step should appear within your process.

<<table-work-step-settings>> explains the settings for the work step.

[[table-work-step-settings]]
.Setting up the work step: Settings
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Name*
|Select a name that identifies the work step as clearly as possible.

| *Quantity*
|Decide how many orders should be processed every time the process runs.

| *Next step*
|Decide whether your process should automatically continue on to the next step, or if the process should wait until the next step is started manually. This setting is only relevant if you’ve created more than one work step. +
*Awaiting input* = The next work step will not start automatically. Instead, the system will wait until you have clicked on *Start* again. +
*Start automatically* = The next step will be started automatically.

| *Position*
|This option is not visible until you have created the work step. +
If your process includes multiple work steps, then use this option to specify which step should be first, second, third, etc. New work steps are automatically given the next available position number. Change the position number if you want to change which work step runs first, second, third, and so on. Work steps run in ascending order. In other words, the work step with the lowest number runs first. +
*_Tip:_* The position of work steps can also be changed using the context menu. To do so, right-click the work step and select *Move up* or *Move down*.

[#incoming-items]
== Incoming items

You can use the work step *Incoming items* to search for and register single incoming items, to search for orders and then book the items contained in the order and to automatically assign reorders.

=== Setting

[.instruction]
Creating a work step:

. Click on *New work step*.
. Select the type *Incoming items* and click on *Save*. +
→ The settings window opens.
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-work-step-incoming-settings>>.

[[table-work-step-incoming-settings]]
.Setting up the work step: Settings
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Position*
|This option is not visible until you’ve created the work step. +
If your process includes multiple work steps, then use this option to specify which step should be first, second, third, etc. New work steps are automatically given the next available position number. Change the position number if you want to change which work step runs first, second, third, and so on. Work steps run in ascending order. In other words, the work step with the lowest number runs first. +
*_Tip:_* The position of work steps can also be changed using the context menu. To do so, right-click the work step and select *Move up* or *Move down*.

| *Name*
|Select a name that identifies the work step as clearly as possible.

| *Next step*
|Decide whether your process should automatically continue on to the next step, or if the process should wait until the next step is started manually. This setting is only relevant if you’ve created more than one work step. +
*Awaiting input* = The next work step will not start automatically. Instead, the system will wait until you have clicked on *Start* again +
*Start automatically* = The next step will be started automatically.
|====

The work step will be displayed. If you hover the cursor over the element, the settings elements appear.
