This chapter deals with the work steps that can be configured for processes. You can create and configure as many work steps as you want for a process. Depending on which type of work step you choose, you’ll be given different settings and options to choose from. These are primarily made up of procedures and sub-procedures that are carried out one after the other and can either run endlessly or be controlled manually. You can set up conditions that act as filters and make it possible to customise your work steps.

Learn about work steps in our playful tutorial:

[IMPORTANT]
.Tool plentyBase required
====
You need <<automation/processes/installing-plentybase#, plentyBase>> to create and run processes. You can download the installation files for plentyBase in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/plentyBase_5053[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].
====

Select the type of work step when you create a new work step.

.Creating a new work step
image::automation/processes/assets/EN-Einstell-Prozesse-Arbeitsschritte01-SI[Creating a new work step]

Click on the **green plus** and carry out the settings as described in the following sub-chapters.

[#order-group-processing]
== Order group processing

Use this work step if you want to modify several orders at once. Start out by choosing filters to specify which exact orders should be included in the process. Then decide how you want to change the orders that have finished being processed. Change the orders’ status, owner and/or flag, so that you never accidentally process the same order twice. Lastly, decide which order should be processed first, second, third, etc.

=== Configuration

First create a work step.

[.instruction]
Creating a work step:

. Click on **New work step**.
. Choose the type **Order group processing**.
. Save the settings. +
→ The configuration window opens (image 2).

If you’ve already created a work step, click on the **pencil icon** to open this window.

.Configuring the work step
image::automation/processes/assets/EN-Settings-Processes-Work-Steps-Order-Group-Processing-01[Configuring the work step]


[NOTE]
.Example configuration
====
The work step shown in image 2 will process a maximum of 30 orders that meet the specific filter criteria (the order must have flag 30 and it must have been received yesterday). Once the orders have been processed, they will be given a different status and a different owner.
====

All of the different settings are described below.

==== Settings

Use this area to save general settings for the work step. For example, save a name and decide where the work step should appear within your process.

<<table-work-step-settings>> explains the settings for the work step.

[[table-work-step-settings]]
.Configuring the work step; Settings
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| **Name**
|Select a name that identifies the work step as clearly as possible.

| **Quantity**
|Decide how many orders should be processed at once.

| **Next step**
|Decide whether your process should automatically continue on to the next step, or if the process should wait until the next step is started manually. This setting is only relevant if you’ve created more than one work step. +
**Awaiting input** = The next work step will not start automatically. Instead, the system will wait until you’ve clicked on **Start** again. +
**Start automatically** = The next step will be started automatically.

| **Position**
|This option is not visible until you’ve created the work step. +
If your process includes multiple work steps, then use this option to specify which step should be first, second, third, etc. New work steps are automatically given the next available position number. Change the position number if you want to change which work step runs first, second, third, etc. Work steps run in ascending order. In other words, the work step with the lowest number runs first. +
*_Tip:_* Work steps can also be moved using the context menu. To do so, right-click the work step and select *Move up* or *Move down*.
|====


==== Filter

Use filters to limit which exact orders are modified with the *Order group processing* work step.

<<table-work-step-filter>> lists all of the filters that are available for this work step.

[[table-work-step-filter]]
.Configuring the work step; Filters
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Filter |Explanation

2+|Order data

| *Previously started box picking*
| *Continue* = The last round of box picking will continue when you start the process. +
Users <<automation/processes/FAQ#400, will be notified>> if they start a round of box picking but they don’t finish it. If you don’t want to continue a previously started round of box picking, then you can <<automation/processes/FAQ#400, reset the box picking instead>>.

| **Number of order items**
|Select an **operator** from the drop-down list and enter a number into the field. Orders will only be processed if they include this number of items.

| **Order type**
|Select a specific order type if you only want to process this type of order. The list also includes some combinations of order types.

| **Order warehouse**
|Filters orders that relate to a specific warehouse. Add the filter and then select the warehouse from the drop-down list. +
Optional: then add the *Storage location* filter afterward.

| **Date**
|Filters orders that were received, paid for or shipped at a specific point in time, e.g. **Yesterday** or **In the past**. You can select more than one option.

| *Current invoice*
|Filters orders that either have or do not have a current invoice. Add the filter and select the option *Available* or *Not available*.

| *Reversal document*
|Filters orders that either have or do not have a reversal document. Add the filter and select the option *Available* or *Not available*.

| **Owner**
|Filters the orders that belong to a specific person. +
**Active user** = The person who is currently logged in.

| **Express shipping**
|Select whether you want to filter orders with express shipping. +
**Yes** = Only orders with express shipping +
**No** = Only orders without express shipping

| **Total quantity of items**
|Select an **operator** from the drop-down list and enter a number into the field. Filters orders that include a specific number of unique items.

| **Weight**
|Orders can be filtered by weight in grams. Enter a value and select the **equals sign** to filter orders with an exact weight. Enter a value and select the appropriate operator to filter orders within a certain weight range. You can filter two different ranges by using both text fields at once. +
**Example**: For a weight of 3.5 kg and higher, enter **3500** into the text field and select the operator **>=**.

| **Referrer**
|Select the referrer for whichever orders you want to filter. You can select more than one option.

| **Customer class**
|Select one or more customer classes.

| *Storage location*
|Filters orders that relate to a specific storage location. +
First, add the filter *Order warehouse* and select the warehouse from the drop-down list. Then use this filter to specify a particular *Rack*, *Shelf* and *Storage location*.

| **Country of delivery**
|Select the country of delivery for whichever orders you want to filter. You can select any country of delivery. Not only the ones that are activated in your system.

| **Client (store)**
|Select the client (store) for whichever orders you want to filter. You can select more than one option.

| **Flag**
|Filters orders that have a specific flag. The option **None** will filter orders that do not have a flag.

//| **Pending pick list**
//|Pending <<orders/order-documents/pick-list, pick lists>> are those that have not been completely processed yet. In order for the filter to be effective, a pending pick list has to be available in general. If this is not the case, then orders will not be filtered by the specified conditions. Instead, orders will be loaded by other filters set up here only. Options: +
//**Use** = Continue processing a pending pick list. +
//**Do not use** = Start a new pick list. +
//If the filter with the setting **Use** is looking for the corresponding orders and finds a pending pick list, the orders of this pick list will be loaded. All other filters set up for this work step will be ignored then. You have to set up a <<stock-management/setting-up-a-warehouse, box storage rack>> in the <<automation/processes/procedures#140, item registration>> procedure as a condition for the following processing of the loaded pick list. +
//If you deactivate the filter by selecting **Do not use**, then a new pick list will automatically be created assuming that the previously mentioned condition is fulfilled. However, if there is a pending pick list available when selecting this option, then the process will be canceled and an error message will be displayed. In this case, the pending pick list has to be processed in advance.

| **Packstation**

First create a work step.

[.instruction]
Creating a work step:

. Click on **New work step**.
. Select **Incoming items** and click on **Save**. +
→ The configuration window opens (image 5).
. Carry out the settings according to <<table-work-step-incoming-settings>>.
. Save the settings.

If you’ve already created a work step, click on the **pencil icon** to open this window.

|====
|Setting |Explanation

| **Position**
|This option is not visible until you’ve created the work step. +
If your process includes multiple work steps, then use this option to specify which step should be first, second, third, etc. New work steps are automatically given the next available position number. Change the position number if you want to change which work step runs first, second, third, etc. Work steps run in ascending order. In other words, the work step with the lowest number runs first. +
*_Tip:_* Work steps can also be moved using the context menu. To do so, right-click the work step and select *Move up* or *Move down*.

| *Name*
|The name of the work step. Select a name that identifies the work step as clearly as possible.

| *Next step*
|Decide whether your process should automatically continue on to the next step, or if the process should wait until the next step is started manually. This setting is only relevant if you’ve created more than one work step. +
**Awaiting input** = The next work step will not start automatically. Instead, the system will wait until you’ve clicked on **Start** again. +
**Start automatically** = The next step will be started automatically.
|====

The work step will be displayed. Point your cursor to the element to display the configuration elements.
