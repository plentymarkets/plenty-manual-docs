== Carrying out basic settings for incoming payments

In this menu, carry out settings that you want to use for automatically assigning payments and for giving goodwill on payments. Default settings are already saved in the system. These default values are generally recommended. To change these settings, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Changing the basic settings:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Payment » Incoming*.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-settings-incoming-payments>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[table-settings-incoming-payments]]
.carrying out basic settings for incoming payments
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Match for automatic assignment*
|Choose between *0.7* (no exact match required for assignment) and *1.0* (exact match required). If you enter a relatively high value, then it may not be possible to assign some payments. Therefore, the value *0.75* is set by *default*.

| *Goodwill on payment*
|You can ensure that, e.g. internal decimal amounts (starting with the third decimal place) do not lead to incorrect bookings by entering a *minimum amount* of *0.01* (default setting). If you set *0.05*, then amounts that are incorrect by 5 cents or less will still be treated as correct bookings.

| [#intable-import-customer-bank-data]*Import customer bank data*
|Select whether or not the customer's *bank data* should be *imported* and saved in the *customer data* when incoming payments are received. +
*_Important:_* The customer has to agree to having their bank data imported and saved. Therefore, this function is set to *No* by default. Before activating the function, contact a legal adviser to discuss the legality of doing so. You may need to consider the laws that relate to several different countries of delivery.

| *Only assign incoming PayPal payment to corresponding eBay listing if attached to the payment*
|*_Note:_* This functionality only applies to the old PayPal interface for Callisto online shops in plentymarkets, *not* for the PayPal plugin! +
If you use eBay listings in combination with the payment method PayPal, we recommend to set this option to *Yes*. This way, it is made sure that incoming payments effected via PayPal are correctly assigned to the corresponding eBay order. If an eBay listing ID is attached to a PayPal payment and the option is activated, the payment is only assigned to the order with a corresponding eBay listing ID.

| *Ignore WooCommerce PayPal transactions*
|*_Note:_* This functionality only applies to the old PayPal interface for Callisto online shops in plentymarkets, *not* for the PayPal plugin! +
Select the option *Yes* to deactivate the automatic import of payments belonging to orders imported from WooCommerce with the payment method PayPal.

|*Exclude orders with the following payment methods from automatic assignment*
|Select those payment methods for which no payments are incoming. They are then ignored for payment assignment. +
Use the keyboard to select multiple payment methods.

|*Exclude orders with the following referrers from automatic assignment*
|Select those referrers for which no payments are incoming. They are then ignored for payment assignment. +
Use the keyboard to select multiple referrers.

== Booking payments

Payments can either come into your system automatically or they can be booked manually. For example, payments will automatically be imported into your system if you use interfaces to external payment providers. Some payment providers forward the customer to their own page for finalising the payment process. Others have your online shop receive the payment details and then forward them to the provider in the background. In both cases, plentymarkets receives a confirmation from the provider after a payment has been made successfully and makes a note of the incoming payment directly in the order. You can e.g. manually import bank postings for payments made without a payment provider.

[#30]
=== Importing bank postings

The payment method cash in advance and other transfers take the form of bank postings. With these payment methods, the payments that were booked on your account have to be reported to the system and then they need to be assigned to the orders. Import bank postings into your plentymarkets system in CSV format. Note that the order of the parameters depends on your bank program. First, carry out the necessary data format settings:

[.instruction]
Defining the column order:

. Go to *Orders » Payments (Deprecated)*. +
→ The *Payments* will be displayed.
. Click on the *Bank postings » Tab: Data format settings* tab.
. Select a *bank account*.
. Click on *Edit*. +
→ The *Field entries* table will be displayed.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-defining-column-order>>.
. *Save* the settings.

[[table-defining-column-order]]
.defining the column order
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Bank account*
|Select *Default account* or *Account 2*. If different configurations are required, set up *Account 2* as an alternative.

| *Starting in line*
|Select a line starting from which the posting data will be imported. CSV files often start with an header line. In that case, select the value *2* here.

| *Content*
|Select the content and define the order of the columns in the CSV file.
|====

Then, import the posting file.

[.instruction]
Carrying out the import:

. Go to *Orders » Payments (Deprecated)*. +
→ The *Payments* will be displayed.
. Click on the *Bank postings » Tab: Import* tab.
. Select the *bank account* from the drop-down list.
. Select the *field separator*.
. Click on *Browse...* under *Posting file*. +
→ A new window will open.
. Select the CSV file.
. Click on *Import*. +
→ The posting file will be imported.

You can repeat this process multiple times. In doing so, duplicates, i.e. data records that were imported twice, will be discarded. Following the import, the automatic assignment will be started and incoming payments are assigned to orders.

[#40]
=== Manually booking payments

In order to manually book a payment or partial payment in the order, e.g. because the customer picked up the item and paid the item in cash or because a payment cannot be found in the overview, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Booking a payment:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Open the order for which you want to book a payment. +
→ The *Overview* tab will open.
. Open the *Payment* tab.
. Click on *Book payment*. +
→ The *Book payment* window will open.
. Carry out the settings as desired. Pay attention to the information given in <<table-manually-booking-payments>>.
. Click on *Book payment*. +
→ The payment will be booked and will be displayed in the payment overview. The amounts displayed in the header row of the overview will be adjusted.

[[table-manually-booking-payments]]
.manually booking payments
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Amount*
|Enter the full or partial amount that you want to book.

| *Credit/Debit*
|Select *Credit* or *Debit*. The selection depends on the pending amount. *Credit* is selected by default. *Debit* is selected for negative pending amounts, e.g. overpaid payments. This selection can be changed if needed.

| *Currency*
|Select the currency in which the payment should be made.

| *Exchange rate*
|If needed, enter a different exchange rate than what is currently configured in the system. +
*_Important_*: In some cases, you may want to book a payment in a different currency than is currently selected for the payment (default currency), e.g. in US dollars. In this case, select the option *USD* under *Currency* and enter the amount received under *Amount*. +
If you calculated the xref:payment:currencies.adoc#20[exchange rate] in the *Setup » Orders » Payment » Currencies* menu and you want to use this exchange rate, then you do not have to enter anything under *Exchange rate*, because the exchange rate is automatically used. You will need to make an entry under *Exchange rate* if you want to use a different exchange rate for this payment, e.g. the exchange rate at the exact moment when the payment is received. In this case, enter the exchange rate that is applicable at this moment.

| *Designated use*
|The order ID is entered by default. The entry can be changed.

| *Incoming payment*
|Select a date for the incoming payment. The current date is selected by default.
|====

You can recognise manually booked payments by the *Manual booking* icon.

[#50]
=== Non-bookable payments

In some cases, payments cannot be assigned to orders in the overview any longer. For example interim transaction reports, for which the actual payment has already been booked. These payments will be marked with *Non-bookable payment* in the overview.

[#60]
=== Interim transaction report

Interim transaction reports are bookings for planned payments. They are delivered by banks with EBICS.

.interim transaction report
image::order-processing:EN-Interim-Transaction-Report-01.png[]
The value date is displayed under *Imported*. The account is charged on this date. The interim transaction report is confirmed (<<image-payment-interim-transaction-report>> , green arrow) when payment is received (<<image-payment-interim-transaction-report>> , blue arrow).

[[image-payment-interim-transaction-report]]
.payment and confirmed interim transaction report
image::order-processing:EN-Interim-Transaction-Report-02.png[]
The parent ID is displayed for confirmed interim transaction reports. This is the ID of the actual payment.

[#70]
== Assigning payments

After the payments were booked in plentymarkets, they will be assigned to orders automatically with the help of a fuzzy search. If the payment cannot be assigned to the order automatically, then you can still xref:payment:managing-payments.adoc#80[manually assign] the payment to an order. Unassigned payments are marked with a *green arrow*.

[TIP]
.setting up event procedures for incoming payments
====
Incoming payment is an important event when it comes to processing orders. This is because items are not typically shipped until the payment was received. In most cases, the order status in plentymarkets changes from *status [3] - waiting for payment* to *status [5] - cleared for shipping* as soon as the payment was received. Create xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedures] to automatically process orders and ship the items once payment is received.
====

Unassigned incoming payments can be assigned in two different ways. On the one hand, you can assign individual incoming payments manually. On the other hand, you can assign several payments automatically. For further information about how to determine a match rate for incoming payments, refer to xref:payment:managing-payments.adoc#10[Carrying out basic settings for incoming payments].

== Editing payments

Edit payments either in the *Payments (Deprecated)* or directly in the order. If a payment has already been assigned to an order, you can open the order using the ID next to the yellow arrow in the *Assignment* column. Click on the ID to open the order. Open the *Payment* tab within the order to see all payments made in connection with this order. In this tab, you can make use of the same functions as in the *Payments* menu. Additionally, you can directly xref:payment:managing-payments.adoc#20[book payments].

[#130]
=== Displaying payment information

The following information about amounts is given at the top of the overview of incoming payments in the *Payment* tab of an order:

* *Total* = total order amount
* *Paid* = amount already paid
* *Pending* = amount not paid yet

[#140]
=== Splitting payments

Manually booked incoming payments, imported bank postings as well as EBICS payments can be split in the *Orders » Payments (Deprecated)* menu. In this way, one payment can be assigned to multiple orders. Note that interim transaction reports cannot be split. To split payments, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Splitting a payment:

. Go to *Orders » Payments (Deprecated)*.
. In the line of an incoming payment, click on *Split payment*. +
→ The *Split payment* window will open and a list with all open orders will be displayed.
. Filter the orders if needed.
. Select the orders you want to assign to the payment.
. Click on *Execute*. +
⇒ The selected orders are assigned to the payment.

[TIP]
.Newly assigned payments in the overview after splitting a payment
====
After clicking on *Reload*, new entries assigned to the previously selected orders will be created in the payments overview. In addition, an unassigned entry will also be created if there is a remaining amount of the split payment. Then again, the unassigned entry can be split. In order to restore or delete the previously split payment, delete all payments assigned by splitting first.
====

[#150]
=== Deleting payments

In order to delete a payment in the overview, proceed as follows.

. Go to *Orders » Payments (Deprecated)*.
. Click on *Delete* in the line of an incoming payment. +
→ The *Confirm to delete payment* window will open.
. Click on *Delete payment*. +
→ The payment will be deleted.

[#160]
=== Editing partial payments

In some cases, customers do not pay the full order amount. An incoming partial payment causes the order status to change to 3.3 (Ready for shipping; waiting for payment). As soon as an order has been completely paid for, the status will change to 4 (in preparation for shipping) or 5 (cleared for shipping). Set up an event procedure to automatically request your customers via email to pay the remaining amount.

[#170]
=== Editing overpaid payments

If an order was overpaid, the order is set to status 3.2 (in waiting position). In this way, you can contact the customer before shipping the order and ask why the order was overpaid and pay back the overpaid amount.

[#180]
==  Displaying incoming payments on the homepage

You can add the element *Payments* on the homepage of your plentymarkets back end. This element displays information about unassigned payments as well as about all incoming payments from yesterday and today. By clicking on the number of payments, you will be taken directly to the overview of these payments. If you don't want to use this element on your homepage, you can get the same results by going to *Orders » payments (Deprecated)* and using the search filters.

It is recommended that you take a look at the unassigned payments before editing orders. You should see whether incoming *cash in advance* payments are among them, which can usually be assigned to an order without a doubt thanks to the amount and the booking text. This saves your customers long waiting times and it saves you unpleasant complaints.

At least once a week, you should edit and sort out the unassigned payments so that you don't lose track of them in your day-to-day business. For further information about assigning unassigned payments and bookings to orders, refer to xref:payment:managing-payments.adoc#70[Assigning payments].

[TIP]
.Tip
====
Sofortbanking payments will be confirmed via an interface immediately after the payment process. They will then appear again in the system as bank postings. You can delete these bank postings from the list of unassigned payments without concern because the orders in question have already been assigned to the payment.
