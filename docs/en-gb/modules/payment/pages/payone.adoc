To do so, download the Payone plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/payone_5434[plentyMarketplace^]. Setup of the payment method is done with an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment methods are activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the xref:plugins:plugins.adoc#[Plugins] section of the manual.

.Payment methods Secure invoice
======
If you are using the Payone payment method *Secure invoice*, you cannot create invoices for orders with this payment method in your plentymarkets system. The invoices for these orders are available in the Payone Merchant Interface and can then be used as external invoices in plentymarkets. These external invoices are _not_ automatically added to the orders.
