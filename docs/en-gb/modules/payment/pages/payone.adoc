To do so, download the Payone plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/payone_5434[plentyMarketplace^]. Setup of the payment method is done with an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment methods are activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the xref:plugins:plugins.adoc#[Plugins] section of the manual.
