:description: This page contains information on the integration of the PayPal plugin.
:author: team-fulfillment-payment

With the PayPal plugin, you integrate the PayPal payment methods in your online shop and make them available to your customers. To do so, download the PayPal plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/paypal_4690[plentyMarketplace^]. The setup of the payment methods is done via an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment methods are activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the xref:plugins:plugins.adoc#[Plugins] section of the manual.

Once the PayPal plugin is installed, payments are automatically imported into the plentymarkets system via the linked PayPal account. In the assistant, you can set how often you want the import to take place. If the import is done and all assignment criteria are met, PayPal payments are automatically xref:payment:beta-managing-payments-new.adoc#30[assigned to the respective orders]. Due to technical restrictions of PayPal, in exceptional cases the import may take up to 3 hours.

--
[TIP]
.Update to version 6
======
Version 6.0 of the PayPal plugin provides some new features. When doing the update, pay attention to the following points:

* After updating the plugin in the selected plugin set, run the respective assistant once again. +
* The linkage of the account has to be updated in the assistant. This is also necessary, if you have already added an account. +
* Some template containers do no longer exist. The existing ones are linked in the assistant. +
* In case you already set up the Installments banner, you don’t need to further adjust it. +
* Instead of the Express Buttons, there are now buttons for Payment methods. These buttons can also be added. To do so, select the respective settings and set up the buttons. +
* By finishing the assistant, everything will be linked according to your settings. +
* In case you selected new payment methods in the assistant, you need to xref:payment:paypal.adoc#80[grant permission in the customer classes]. Also check your shipping profiles and the settings for event procedures, the procedure manager and processes. Changes in document templates may also be required. All this depends on your workflows. +
Once the assistant has been finished, you can optionally set xref:online-store:shop-builder.adoc#widgets[widgets in the ShopBuilder].
======

[.instruction]
*Updating to version 6.0:*

. Go to *Plugins » Plugin set overview*.
. Open the plugin set you want to update.
. In the line of the plugin under *Actions*, click on *Update*. +
→ The tooltip *Update available* shows that a new version is available. +
→ You are forwarded to the overview for the update.
. Select the version of the plugin that you want to update to. +
→ For the PayPal plugin version 6.0.0, the plugins IO and plentyShop LTS are required at least in version 5.034.
. Click on *Update*. +
→ The update may take some time.
. Once the update is done, deploy the plugin set. +
→ In the plugin set, the versions of the plugin should be the same in the columns *Installed* and *Deployed*.
. Complete the assistant. Pay attention to the points mentioned above. +
→ It is possible that PayPal is not available as payment method for a short period of time until everything has been completed. Thus, consider this when planning the update.

[#10]
== Requirement: Opening a PayPal business account

To work with PayPal, you first need a PayPal business account. You get information as well as login details when you open the account. Without these, the plugin cannot be set up and is not usable. If you don’t have one yet, open a link:https://www.paypal.com/uk/business[PayPal business account^] first.

[#20]
== Completing the assistant

[IMPORTANT]
.Activating the plugin set in the main client
====
For account linking and the functionality of event procedures, the PayPal plugin has to be activated in the plugin set used for the main client. Since there is a dependency on the IO plugin, IO must be active for the deployment process (saving the plugin set).

.*Information about address validation*
--

The PayPal assistant contains the option *Address validation* in the section *Order processing*. This validation is _automatically activated_. You have to select to deactivate the validation. You can either deactivate the validation for selected or for all countries. To do so, check (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the countries for which addresses are _not to be validated_. +
If the payment should also be executed with an incomplete address you should deactivate the address validation.

The default validation is a PayPal requirement. The validation checks if there is a complete address. It is not validated whether this is an actually existing address. The payment is only executed successfully if there is a complete address. +
The PayPal address validation is important for the coverage when shipping goods. Moreover, PayPal offers buyer and customer protection, which is especially important when orders are processed with PayPal Express. In this case, the address is transmitted by PayPal itself.

== PayPal Import - only from version 6.0 onwards

The entry *PayPal import* with the PayPal icon in the navigation on the left is only displayed when the PayPal plugin is installed. To use this function, you need at least version 6.0.0 of the PayPal plugin. +
With the function *PayPal import*, you import PayPal payments from your PayPal account directly into your plentymarkets system by using the transaction numbers. In this import, only new payments are imported. Already existing payments are not updated. To import the PayPal payments, proceed as follows:

[.instruction]
Importing PayPal payments:

. Select *PayPal import* in the navigation on the left.
. Select the correct *PayPal account*.
. In the *Transaction number(s)* field, enter the transaction numbers of the payments you want to import. +
→ You can enter several transaction numbers, separated by comma.
. Click on *Execute* (material:import_export[]). +
→ The payments with the entered transaction numbers are imported and added to the payments overview table.

After importing the PayPal payments, they are automatically assigned to orders, just like other payments as well. Note that the auto-assignment depends on the setting *Match for automatic assignment (0.7 - 1.0)* in the *Setup » Orders » Payment » Incoming* menu. The value 0.7 stands for a 70% match and the value 1.0 stands for a 100% match. In case a payment cannot be assigned automatically, you can still xref:payment:beta-managing-payments-new.adoc#30[assign] them manually. +
*_Note:_* After the import, it can take up to 15 minutes until the automatic assignment is done.

[#100]
== Editing text elements

You can edit texts of the plugin in the *CMS » Multilingualism* menu. The texts can be adapted into all available system languages. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Adapting language files:

. Go to *CMS » Multilingualism*.
. On the left side, select the *Source language* from the drop-down list.
. On the right side, select the *Target language* from the drop-down list.
. Expand the various sections in the *PayPal* area.
. Enter the text for the individual text elements in the area of the target language.
. *Save* (material:save[]) the settings.
. Deploy the plugin set again to apply these changes.

By selecting *German* as the *Target language*, you can adapt the German labels for your online shop. The selected labels are then also applied in the back end, only the addition _Plugin: PayPal_ remains. This way, it remains traceable where a payment method comes from. Reload the back end to see the changes.

== PayPal Dispute

The *PayPal Dispute plugin* allows you to work on problems and solve conflicts with your customers directly in your plentymarkets system. In plentymarkets, the notifications and the messenger are used for this.

[#320]
=== Requirements and installation

Using PayPal Dispute requires setting up the xref:payment:paypal.adoc#10[PayPal plugin] first. You need version 5.0.0 or higher of the PayPal plugin. Moreover, plentyShop LTS and IO are required from version 5.0.0 and higher.

Download and install the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/paypaldispute_6582[PayPal Dispute plugin^] to integrate PayPal Dispute into your plentymarkets system. After the installation of the plugin, the corresponding assistant is available. With the help of this assistant you can add the PayPal accounts for which you want to use PayPal Dispute. Proceed as follows, to complete the assistant and set up PayPal Dispute.

[.instruction]
Setting up PayPal Dispute with the assistant:

. Go to *Setup » Assistants » Plugins » [select Plugin set]*.
. Select the assistant *PayPal Dispute*.
. Complete the assistant.

PayPal Dispute is now set up in your plentymarkets system.

[#330]
=== Using PayPal dispute in plentymarkets

The advantage of using the PayPal Dispute plugin is that you will be informed about all cases of customers that reported a problem with a merchandise or service to PayPal directly in your plentymarkets back end. Go to *CRM » Messenger* to see all dispute messages. The buyer has 4 options to report a problem. The reactions available to you depend on the problem reported by the customer and on the level of escalation the problem has reached. The first level is called dispute and the second level is called claim. The 4 options available to the buyer are the following:

* Item not received
* Item not as described
* Unauthorised activity
* Billing issue

As long as a problem is still on the first level of escalation, the dispute level, you can still exchange messages with the customer to solve the problem. Once a problem is escalated to PayPal, the level of escalation will be set to claim and simple messages will no longer be send to PayPal.
