With the PayPal plugin, you integrate the PayPal payment methods in your online shop and make them available to your customers. To do so, download the PayPal plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/payone_5434[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. Setup of the payment method is done with an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment methods are activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the <<plugins# Plugins>> section of the manual.

[#10]
== Requirement: Opening a PayPal business account

To work with PayPal, you first need a PayPal business account. You get information as well as login details when you open the account. Without these, the plugin cannot be set up and is not usable. If you don’t have one yet, open a link:https://www.paypal.com/de/business[PayPal business acount^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] first.

[#20]
== Completing the assistant

[IMPORTANT]
.Activating the plugin set in the main client
====
For account linking and the functionality of event procedures, the PayPal plugin has to be activated in the plugin set used for the main client. Since there is a dependency on the IO plugin, IO must be active for the deployment process (saving the plugin set).

.*Information about address validation*
--

The PayPal assistant contains the option *Address validation* in the section *Order processing*. This validation is _automatically activated_. You have to select to deactivate the validation. You can either deactivate the validation for selected or for all countries. To do so, check (icon:check-square[role="blue"]) the countries for which addresses are _not to be validated_. +
If the payment should also be executed with an incomplete address you should deactivate the address validation.

The default validation is a PayPal requirement. The validation checks if there is a complete address. It is not validated whether this is an actually existing address. The payment is only executed successfully if there is a complete address. +
The PayPal address validation is important for the coverage when shipping goods. Moreover, PayPal offers buyer and customer protection, which is especially important when orders are processed with PayPal Express. In this case, the address is transmitted by PayPal itself.

|Optional: The Banners for PayPal Installments can be placed in many different ways to promote this payment method. You can choose between a graphic banner (PayPal Installment Graphical Promotion Banner) and a text banner (PayPal Installment Text Promotion Banner). A separate integration is not necessary. In the assistant, the banners can automatically be linked to an item page, the cart or the checkout. Additionally, the banners are also available to you as widgets in the ShopBuilder. Thus, they can be placed where they are needed, e.g. on landing pages, item pages, the shopping cart or the checkout.

For Germany, for example, the payment methods Debit, Credit card and Invoice are possible. With this, a maximum of 14 payment methods can be shown in the checkout.
But if, for example, only PayPal and Credit card are allowed for a certain delivery country, the maximum number is restricted to 12.

Moreover, PayPal PLUS limits the number of characters for the names of the other payment methods. The maximum number of characters is limited to 25.  If a name has more than 25 characters, it is truncated.  +
Note that special characters, e.g. an umlaut, reduces the number of characters, because they are read out in HTML-style.

PayPal states the following:

* max. image size of 100 x 25 px +
* max. 25 characters for *methodName* +
* max. 120 characters for *description*

=== Configuring PayPal using the assistant

When configuring PayPal with the assistant, problems in the online shop may occur under certain circumstances. Updating the PayPal plugin often helps with this:

[qanda]
I want to update PayPal. How should I proceed?
    If you want to update the PayPal plugin in a copy of your plugin set, you have to change the back end plugin set that is linked to your user account. For further information on how to change your back end plugin set, refer to the page <<plugins/installing-added-plugins#, Installing added plugins>>. After reloading your back end, you can complete the assistant.

[#130]
=== First aid: Problems with linking your PayPal account

If you have problems with linking your PayPal account with plentymarkets, it is advisable to use a different <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-system-requirements#100, browser,>> just to eliminate this as a source of errors. Moreover, you should make sure that there are no basic problems with your PayPal account itself. Possibly, the email address was not confirmed yet, PayPal PLUS was not activated yet or you did not set a password yet. More possible sources of error and their solutions are described below.

[#140]
==== What am I to do if I am not redirected to plentymarkets after I activated my PayPal account?

First check whether the  link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/paypal_4690[latest PayPal version]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] is installed and deployed in your plentymarkets system. How to update plugins is explained in the manual chapter <<plugins/updating-installed-plugins#, Updating installed plugins>>.

[WARNING]
.Activation and preview of the plugin
====
Make sure that the PayPal plugin is already activated and deployed in the plugin set of the main client when you are linking your account with plentymarkets. If this is not the case, malfunctions can occur. +
Attention: The plugin-set preview must _not_ be open while the PayPal account is linked with plentymarkets.
====

.Redirection to plentymarkets is not possible
image::_best-practices/auftragsabwicklung/Payment/assets/PP-Plugin_Fehler_1.png[Plugin Fehlermeldung 1]

[%interactive]
* *Solution 1*: Change the browser and try again. plentymarkets supports the browsers Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
* *Solution 2*: There is still an active API right in the PayPal account. Remove the rights for plentymarkets. The API authorisation can be found on the following website: link:https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_profile-api-list-auths[]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

[WARNING]
.NOTE
====
With removing the API rights, all linked PayPal accounts are disconnected from your plentymarkets system. In case a PayPal account is linked with the market *eBay*, this account has to be linked with the PayPal interface again.
====

[#150]
==== What am I to do if I am asked to sign up for a business account again?

.New PayPal business account

* *Adding an account*: Was the right option selected? Add new account or use existing account.
* *New account*: Check whether the email address of the PayPal business account has been entered correctly.
* *Activate PayPal PLUS*: Only activate this option if you also signed up for PayPal PLUS with this account.

[#160]
=== Problems with the PayPal PLUS Wall

If the PayPal PLUS Wall is not or only incorrectly displayed, the reason often has to do with missing access or restrictions of the Wall itself. Also pay attention to <<payment/payment-plugins/paypal#50, Additional information about the PayPal PLUS Wall>>.

[#170]
==== What do I do if the PayPal PLUS Wall is not displayed?

If the PayPal PLUS Wall is not displayed, check the following:

[%interactive]

* [ ] Make sure that you are allowed by PayPal to use PayPal PLUS.
* [ ] Check the settings in the PayPal assistant.
→ PayPal PLUS has to be activated in *Account* step of the assistant.
* [ ] Check the <<payment/payment-plugins/paypal#intable-paypal-plus-wall, container links>>. They should be created automatically by completing the assistant but can also be set manually.
* [ ] In order to use PayPal PLUS the payment method has to be <<payment/payment-plugins/paypal#80, allowed in customer classes and unblocked in shipping profiles>>.

[#180]
==== Why are not all payment methods displayed in the PayPal PLUS Wall?

Not the following if a payment methods is not shown in the PayPal PLUS Wall:

* Payment methods depend on the delivery country. For example, invoice and debit are only cleared for Germany. Also pay attention to <<payment/payment-plugins/paypal#50, Additional information about the PayPal PLUS Wall>>.
* If a payment method is not cleared, contact  link:https://www.paypal.com/uk/business[PayPal]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] directly about this. They can activate payment methods for your PayPal business account.

In order to see all changes to the PayPal plugin and to not miss any updates, use the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/paypal_4690[changelog of the PayPal plugins]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. In general we recommend to use the plugin payment methods available on the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment/payment-integrations[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

[#300]
== PayPal Dispute

The *PayPal Dispute plugin* allows you to work on problems and solve conflicts with your customers directly in your plentymarkets system. In plentymarkets, the notifications and the messenger are used for this.

[#320]
=== Requirements and installation

Using PayPal Dispute requires setting up the <<payment/payment-plugins/paypal#10, PayPal plugin>> first. You need version 5.0.0 or higher of the PayPal plugin. Moreover, required are plentyShop LTS and IO from version 5.0.0 and higher.

Download and install the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/paypaldispute_6582[PayPal Dispute-Plugin]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] to integrate PayPal Dispute into your plentymarkets system. After the installation of the plugin, the corresponding assistant is available. With the help of this assistant you can add those PayPal accounts for which you want to use PayPal Dispute.

[.instruction]
Setting up PayPal Dispute with the assistant:

. Go to *Setup » Assistants » Plugins » [select Plugin set]*.
. Select the assistant *PayPal Dispute*.
. Complete the assistant.

PayPal Dispute is now set up in your plentymarkets system.

[#330]
=== Using PayPal dispute in plentymarkets

The advantage of using the PayPal Dispute plugin is that you will be informed about all cases of customers that reported a problem with a merchandise or service to PayPal directly in your plentymarkets back end. Go to *CRM » Messenger* to see all dispute messages. The buyer has 4 options to report a problem. The reactions available to you depend on the problem reported by the customer and on the level of escalation the problem has reached. There are 2 levels of escalation. The first level is called dispute and the second level is called claim. The 4 options available to the buyer are the following:

* Item not received
* Item not as described
* Unauthorised activity
* Billing issue

As long as a problem is still on the first level of escalation, the dispute level, you can still exchange messages with the customer to solve the problem. Once a problem is escalated to PayPal the level of escalation will be set to claim and simple messages will no longer be send to PayPal.

[IMPORTANT]
.Loading of new cases
====
Once you have opened a case in the Dispute plugin no other case will be loaded. This means you need to close the Dispute plugin tab every time you want to open a different case.
====

The following table explains the options you have when you want to react to new dispute cases.
