With the Klarna plugin, you integrate the Klarna payment methods in your online shop and make them available to your customers. To do so, download the Klarna plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/klarna_6731[plentyMarketplace^]. Setup of the payment method is done with an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment methods are activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the xref:plugins:plugins.adoc#[Plugins] section of the manual.

== Editing text elements

You can edit texts of the plugin in the *CMS » Multilingualism* menu. The texts can be adapted into all available system languages. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Adapting language files:

. Go to *CMS » Multilingualism*.
. On the left side, select the *Source language* from the drop-down list.
. On the right side, select the *Target language* from the drop-down list.
. Expand the section *payment method* in the *Klarna* area.
. Enter the text for the individual text elements in the area of the target language.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Deploy the plugin set again to apply these changes.

By selecting *German* as the *Target language*, you can adapt the German labels for your online shop. The selected labels are then also applied in the back end, only the addition _Plugin: Klarna_ remains. This way, it remains traceable where a payment method comes from. Reload the back end to see the changes.
