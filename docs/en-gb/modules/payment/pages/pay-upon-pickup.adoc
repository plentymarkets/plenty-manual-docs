With the Pay upon pickup plugin, you integrate the payment method *Cash payment* in your online shop and make it available to your customers. To do so, download the plugin Pay upon pickup from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/payuponpickup_4757[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. Setup of the payment method is done with an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment method is activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the <<plugins#, Plugins>> section of the manual.

== Editing text elements

You can edit texts of the plugin in the *CMS » Multilingualism* menu. The texts can be adapted into all available system languages. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Adapting language files:

. Go to *CMS » Multilingualism*.
. On the left side, select the *Source language* from the drop-down list.
. On the right side, select the *Target language* from the drop-down list.
. Expand the section *payment method* in the *PayUponPickup* area.
. Enter the text for the individual text elements in the area of the target language.
. Save (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.
. Deploy the plugin set again to apply these changes.

By selecting *German* as the *Target language*, you can adapt the German labels for your online shop. The selected labels are then also applied in the back end, only the addition _Plugin_ remains. This way, it remains traceable where a payment method comes from. Reload the back end to see the changes.
