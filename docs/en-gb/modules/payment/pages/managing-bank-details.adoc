== EBICS

EBICS (Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard) is a transmission protocol for banking information for usage by banking clients. With the help of the standardised EBICS procedure, retrieving payments has become even easier. This plugin completely integrates EBICS in plentymarkets. No third party providers are required.

For communication via EBICS, your sales figures are saved on the bank server in a file, comparable to bank statements. This file is imported in your plentymarkets system and the sales figures are booked in plentymarkets. The linked EBICS account can be seen as a combined account of several bank accounts. A file with the sales figures of an EBICS account is generated daily (Format CAMT053 or MT940) after activation by the bank. This file can be retrieved at night and all incoming payments are available the next morning. In addition, multiple interim transaction report files are generated daily (Format CAMT052 or MT942) which can be retrieved to book interim transaction reports in your plentymarkets system.

EBICS is integrated into your system with the EBICS plugin To do so, download the EBICS plugin from the https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/ebics_5098[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. To set up EBICS you have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system.

[IMPORTANT]
.Booking the EBICS module
====
To set up an account, the EBICS module first has to be booked in the configurator.
====

[#70]
=== Applying for EBICS at your bank

The first step in using EBICS in plentymarkets is registering for the procedure with your bank to receive the necessary documents to fill out and return.  Once completed, you will receive all data you need to use EBICS, e.g., the bank customer ID. +
The following details for EBICS have to be entered in the form.

[IMPORTANT]
.Existing EBICS accounts
====
It is not allowed to set up existing EBICS accounts which are already in use in plentymarkets. Multiple users (participants) can be listed in an EBICS account.  If you already hold an account, then apply for a new one (technical user is also possible). Only use this account for plentymarkets.

====

[#80]
==== Account numbers

Enter the account numbers for the accounts that you would like revenue to be retrieved and booked into plentymarkets from. Entering account numbers is optional because the retrieval is technically based on the user data. For further information about entering or not entering of account numbers refer to <<table-provision-bank-statements>>.

[IMPORTANT]
.Only save business accounts
====
There is currently no option in plentymarkets for setting up accounts individually for EBICS retrieval. This means that payment transactions can only be retrieved globally by the plentymarkets system for all accounts saved. This includes e.g. payment transactions on your private account as well, if this account was saved. For this reason, only save the account numbers of your business accounts.
====

[WARNING]
.One account for several users
====
If several different users all refer to the same account (some banks manage multiple accounts together), then problems may occur if retrieval is carried out simultaneously. This is true even if the users work with different plentymarkets systems. There is currently no solution to prevent this.
====

[#90]
==== Provision of bank statements

Provisioning of bank statements can either be done based on the date of the bookkeeping entry or based on bank statements.

[[table-provision-bank-statements]]
.Provision of bank statements
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Based on date of bookkeeping entry*
|A fictitious, consecutive number is included. This setting is activated by default.

| *Based on bank statements*
|An effective bank statement number is included. Provided that automatic bank statement retrieval is carried out on a daily basis.
|====

[#100]
==== Participants

When setting up your accounts for EBICS, you create one or more xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#10[users] for your accounts. EBICS users are called participants (German: Teilnehmer). You can create participants including different order types. One of these participants has to be saved in the plentymarkets system with the *participant ID* that you received from your bank.

plentymarkets only requires one participant, e.g. a user account with the lowest rights, in order to carry out the EBICS payment retrieval. Only one participant may be set up per EBICS account.

[#110]
==== Order type

Plentymarkets needs the order types as explained in <<table-order-signature-types>> in order to successfully retrieve the transactions on your EBICS account. Also pay attention to the notes about order and signature types given on your bank’s forms.

[[table-order-signature-types]]
.Order and signature types
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Type |Explanation

| *STA*
|Statement of account *MT940* or *CAMT053*. xref:payment:managing-bank-details.adoc#180[Retrieval of the transactions] at the end of the day.

| *VMK*
|Interim transaction report *MT942* or *CAMT052.* Depending on the respective bank, interim transaction reports are created and made ready for retrieval several times a day. This xref:payment:managing-bank-details.adoc#190[information] is optional for plentymarkets.

| *EU Type "T"*
|Signature type that provides authorisation exclusively for the retrieval of transaction data.
|====

[#120]

|====

[IMPORTANT]
.Contact your bank before making changes
====
Carry out changes only after consultation with your bank. For example, if you want to use the new CAMT formats, then ask your bank whether or not this format is supported and have the format activated. Then make any necessary changes to the account settings and interim transaction report as described here.

If an account was reset and your bank needs new keys, then we recommend that you set up the EBICS account again in plentymarkets. This way new keys will be generated.
====

[#140]
==== Initialising the account

After you have entered your access data into plentymarkets, the system electronically registers at your bank. Secret key values are necessary for retrieval via EBICS. They are generated by the system. After these key values were created and the initial electronic registration was carried out, the values have to be printed out, signed and handed in at your bank. Only the participant saved in plentymarkets is authorised to sign this document. The bank will not activate the EBICS interface if the signature was not given by the participant saved in the system.

[TIP]
.Browser pop-up blocker
====
For the download of the initialisation letter to work properly, the pop-up blocker of your browser has to be deactivated.
====

[.instruction]
Initialising the account:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Payment » Plugin » EBICS*.
. Click on the card of the account you want to initialise on *Edit*. +
→ The window *Account settings* is opened.
. Click on *Initialise account*. +
→ The keys are generated, INI and HIA are executed. +
Once all processes are completed successfully, the button *Create initialisation letter* is activated.
. Click on *Create initialisation letter*. +
→ The initialisation letter is downloaded as a pdf document.
. Sign the initialisation letter and submit it to your bank. +
→ The bank checks the information and approves the account. You are informed once this process is complete.
. Click on *Finish initialisation (HPB)*. +
→ The account is successfully initialised.

The electronically submitted values will be compared with the values on the printed document. Then, the EBICS interface will be activated. From this moment on, the transactions will be retrieved at the retrieval times listed below.

[#150]
=== Retrieval times of transactions

Maximum twice a day, your bank provides the day’s transactions in a data format. Currently, plentymarkets retrieves this data at 6am, 1pm and 11pm. Transaction data is available in the system approximately one hour after the retrieval. In addition, the bank provides interim transaction reports in data format several times a day. These can be retrieved and include the transactions of the current day.

[#160]
=== Retrieval times of interim transaction reports

Since the times when interim transaction reports are made available differ from bank to bank, plentymarkets retrieves them from the banks, if they are available, every hour between 8am and 6pm. For EBICS postings that have unconfirmed interim transactions, the words *interim transaction* will be displayed in red. If the interim transaction has been confirmed, then the lettering will change from red to green. Additionally, the confirmed posting will be assigned to the corresponding order without having to book the payment again.  You have to activate the statement of account in order for interim transaction reports to be confirmed. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<table-provision-bank-statements>>.

[#170]
=== Managing transactions

== Setting up SEPA direct debit mandate

As part of the SEPA initiative (Single Euro Payments Area), euro payments were standardized in Germany and 35 other European countries on February 1st, 2014. Bank transfers and direct debits can now only be carried out with IBAN and BIC. You can xref:payment:managing-bank-details.adoc#67[migrate] your customers' bank details automatically in the plentymarkets system. There are different types of direct debits:

* *SEPA core direct debit* → Allows a biller to collect funds from a payer's account, provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the payer to the biller
* *SEPA business to business direct debit* → Enables business customers in the role of payers to make payments by direct debit

Business to business direct debits are only permitted between companies (B2B) and they require a separate mandate. You need to receive a SEPA direct debit mandate from your customers. This replaces the previous direct debit authorisation. This mandate is the new legal authorisation for using SEPA direct debit to withdraw funds from another account.

[#230]
=== Creating a document template

Go to *Setup » Orders » Documents* and click on the *SEPA direct debit mandate* submenu. There is a template for configuring the SEPA direct debit mandate. For further information about documents, refer to the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[Document templates] page of the manual.
