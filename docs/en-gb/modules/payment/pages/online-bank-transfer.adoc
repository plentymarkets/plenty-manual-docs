:author: team-fulfillment-payment

With the Online bank transfer plugin, you integrate the Klarna payment method Online bank transfer (Klarna Sofort) in your online shop and make it available to your customers. To do so, download the Online bank transfer plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/sofort_5050[plentyMarketplace^]. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment methods are activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the xref:plugins:plugins.adoc#[Plugins] section of the manual.

[IMPORTANT]
.Requirement
====
The sofort-Plugin has been developed for use with plentyShop LTS and only works with its structure or other template plugins.
====

[#10]
== Requirement: Opening a merchant account

To work with Sofort, you first need a link:https://www.sofort.com/payment/users/register[merchant account^]. You get information as well as login details when you open the account. Without these, the plugin cannot be set up and is not usable.

[#20]
== Setting up a payment method

Before you can use the Online bank transfer plugin you first have to link your merchant account with your plentymarkets system.

[.instruction]
Linking the merchant account:

. Go to *Plugins » Plugin set overview » [select Plugin set]*.
. Open the plugin *Online bank transfer*.
. In the plugin, go to the *Configuration » Base settings* menu. +
→ Note the explanations in <<table-plugin-settings>>.
. Enter the Configuration key. +
→ You get this key during the registration process.
. Carry out further settings in the *Extended settings* area.
. *Save* (material:save[]) the settings.

|Setting |Explanation

2+^| *Basic settings*

| *Activate the payment method*
|*No* is selected as default. +
To activate the payment method, select *Yes*.

| *Configuration key*
|You get the configuration key during the link:https://www.sofort.com/payment/users/register[configuration process^].
The payment method is not activated without a correct input of the key. +
Example for the structure of a configuration key: {Customer number}:{Project ID}:{API key}

|*Set order status directly to 4/5*
|Activate this option if orders paid with the payment method *Online bank transfer* should automatically get the order status 4 or 5 after the payment is imported into the plentymarkets system. +
Note in this context that this only applies when the payments are imported into your plentymarkets system and are then assigned to the orders. The payments with the payment method Sofort / online bank transfer are transferred into your bank account. After this, you import them into your system. For this, you can either use xref:payment:ebics.adoc#[EBICS] or the xref:data:elasticSync-bank-postings.adoc#[postings import]. This means that the payment is already approved when you import them and the order gets an order status. Therefore, with this setting you decide the further workflow of order processing. Also take into account that e.g. event procedures will react to the selected status.

2+^| *Advanced settings*

.*Payment in the system but no order exists*
--
It can happen that an online bank transfer payment is in the system but the corresponding order is not. This happens when customers are not correctly redirected to the checkout. This workflow is defined by Klarna. Changing it would require an adaptation of the plugin and this has to be demanded by Klarna.
