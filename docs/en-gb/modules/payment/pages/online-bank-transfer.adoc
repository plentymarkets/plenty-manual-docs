With the Online bank transfer plugin, you integrate the Klarna payment method Online bank transfer (Klarna Sofort) in your online shop and make it available to your customers. To do so, download the Online bank transfer plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/sofort_5050[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment methods are activated in your system. +

.*Payment in the system but no order exists*
--
It can happen that an online bank transfer payment is in the system but the corresponding order is not. This happens when customers are not correctly redirected to the checkout. This workflow is defined by Klarna. Changing it would require an adaptation of the plugin and this has to be demanded by Klarna.
