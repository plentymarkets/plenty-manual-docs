You downloaded a payment plugin in from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment/payment-integrations[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] and now cannot see the assistant to set up the payment method? First note that it can take up to a few minutes until the assistant is displayed in the system. If you still do not see if after waiting a few moments, check the following:

[%interactive]

* [ ] Is the plugin <<plugins/installing-added-plugins#, installed and deployed>> correctly?
* [ ] Is the plugin installed and deployed in the main client?
* [ ] Did you delete the browser cache and cookies after installing and deploying the plugin?
* [ ] Check if the plugin set in which the payment method is installed is the active plugin set.
