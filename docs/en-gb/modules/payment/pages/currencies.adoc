== Defining the system currency

If you are working with several currencies, you have to select one of those currencies as the standard currency of your plentymarkets system. The standard currency is automatically selected as the default currency whenever no other currency is selected. By default, the standard currency in your system is *EUR* (Euro). +
In plentymarkets, orders are always created in the standard currency. In addition, the currency selected by your customers during the order process is always with every single incoming order. If an order was placed in a currency different from the standard currency, the current exchange rate is also saved with the order. Thus, these values are permanently available and can be used to analyse order data or to e.g. send automatic notifications.

[.instruction]
Defining the system currency:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Payment » Currencies*.
. Select a currency for the option *Standard currency*.
. *Save* the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.System currency vs. Online shop currency
====
This setting is not necessarily identical to the currency displayed in your online shop. You can define a different standard currency for each online shop and each language. Further information on these settings are provided on the manual page <<online-store/setting/setting-up-ceres#201, Carrying out currency settings>>. This page deals directly with setting up your plentyShop.
