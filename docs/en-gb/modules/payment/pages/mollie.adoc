:description: Learn more about the integration of the Mollie plugin.
:author: team-fulfillment-payment

With the Mollie plugin, you integrate the Mollie payment methods in your online shop and make them available to your customers. To do so, download the Mollie plugin from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/mollie_6272[plentyMarketplace^]. Setup of the payment method is done with an assistant. You also have to carry out a few basic settings in your plentymarkets system so that the payment method is activated in your system. +
The explanations in this section apply after adding the plugin. You can find more information on adding and installing plugins in the xref:plugins:plugins.adoc#[Plugins] section of the manual.

[#10]
== Requirement: Registering with Mollie

To use Mollie, you need a Mollie account and the login data. Without these, the plugin cannot be set up and is not usable. If you don’t have a Mollie account yet, link:https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/signup/5543454?lang=de[register first^] .

[TIP]
.Currencies supported by Mollie
====
There are some parameters set by payment providers, among them usually also supported currencies. Which currencies are supported by Mollie can be found in the Mollie documentation on the page link:https://docs.mollie.com/payments/multicurrency[Multicurrency^].

== Completing the assistant

:name-payment-method: Mollie

include::_includes:partial$completing-assistant-payment-method.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Completing the assistant again
====
In some cases, you have to complete the assistant again. If you deactivate a Mollie payment method, which is activated in your plentymarkets system, directly via the dashboard in your Mollie account after you have already completed the assistant, you have to complete it again. If you run it again, the settings will match and cannot lead to a misconfiguration.

.*Single-click payments*
--

With the function Single-click payments, your customers can save their credit card details directly with Mollie by creating a Mollie customer account. This way, they don't have to enter their payment details every time they buy something and payment processing is faster. If you want to make this function available to your customers, you have to activate it in the assistant. +
If you have activated Single-click payments, you can see which of your customers use this function. In this case, a unique ID assigned by Mollie is saved in the corresponding contact data record in plentymarkets. In addition, the customers who use Single-click payments are also listed in your Mollie account.

== Setting up event procedures

Event procedures are part of automations you can set up in plentymarkets. When you use event procedures, a specific event triggers an action for a selection of orders. For further information, refer to the xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[Event procedures] page of the manual.

In connection to payment providers such as Mollie, event procedures are also used to transmit important information to the payment provider. Regarding Mollie, there are three necessary and a few optional event procedures. The necessary event procedures should be set up in any case. These are registering the shipment of the order items of an order, registering the cancellation of an order and when a refund is created. Mollie needs to be informed if these are initiated. If a set up event procedure is triggered, the corresponding call is directly executed in the background so that Mollie is informed within a very short time. +
Optional event procedures are available to you next to these three necessary ones. You can use these if they fit into your individual workflow.

In the following chapters, an example configuration and an explanation to each event procedure are given. But it is important to configure every event procedure so that it meets your individual requirements.

[#70]
=== Registering shipment with Mollie

Use this event procedure to inform Mollie when you shipped an order that was paid with a Mollie payment method. This is a necessary event procedure. +
This event procedure can also be used for delivery orders. The delivery order is then registered with Mollie as a partial shipment.

=== Refund failed or successful

Following the procedure *Mollie | Register refund*, two additional events are available to illustrate the further process of the order: *Mollie refund failed* and *Mollie refund successful*. These are two optional event procedures that can help you with the further order processing.

* *Mollie | Refund failed* = Determine what should happen with those orders for which a refund could not be executed.
* *Mollie | Refund successful* = Determine what should happen with those orders for which a refund could be executed.

You can optionally create event procedures with these events to define how to proceed with these orders. The following event procedure is an example. You decide which process fits best into your workflow of order processing.

=== Payment failed

In addition, the event *Mollie | Payment failed* is also available. Using this event is optional. You can use it to determine what should happen with those orders for which the payment has failed. +
This event takes effect if a payment fails directly after order creation. This could happen, for example, when an order cannot be retrieved from Mollie, the session was deleted or Mollie has a global problem. So, whenever a payment failed, was cancelled or is expired.

You can optionally create event procedures with this event to define how to proceed with these orders. The following event procedure is an example. You decide which process fits best into your workflow of order processing.

== Editing text elements

You can edit texts of the plugin in the *CMS » Multilingualism* menu. The texts can be adapted into all available system languages. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Adapting language files:

. Go to *CMS » Multilingualism*.
. On the left side, select the *Source language* from the drop-down list.
. On the right side, select the *Target language* from the drop-down list.
. Expand the sections *PaymentMethods* and *UI* in the *Mollie* area.
. Enter the text for the individual text elements in the area of the target language.
. Save (material:save[]) the settings.
. Deploy the plugin set again to apply these changes.

By selecting *German* as the *Target language*, you can adapt the German labels for your online shop. The selected labels are then also applied in the back end, only the addition _Plugin: Mollie_ remains. This way, it remains traceable where a payment method comes from. Reload the back end to see the changes.

Find more information on how to edit online shop texts on the manual page xref:online-store:setting-up-ceres.adoc#231[Editing online store texts].
