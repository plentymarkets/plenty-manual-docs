.*Only when using a payment method for several clients: Complete assistant several times*
--
Depending on the configuration of your plugin sets and clients, the {name-assistant} assistant has to be completed more than once. Only this ensures that the {name-payment-method} payment methods are configured correctly and all functions such as event procedures and crons run smoothly in the background.

The following tables show you which assistants you have to complete in which plugin set. The upper row displays the configuration of the plugin sets and clients. The second row lists correspondingly, in which set the {name-assistant} assistant has to be completed for which client.

*_Important_*: The examples are not about either or. The assistant has to be completed several times for multi-clients because it always also has to be completed in the plugin set which is linked with the main client.

*Example 1:*
