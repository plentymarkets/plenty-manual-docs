===== Different data fields in the Kaufland product categories

You have to create a separate catalogue for each Kaufland product category that you want to offer your items in. +
Catalogues for different product categories contain different data fields. This is because different item data has to be specified in each product category. For example, you export different item data in a catalogue for *TVs* than in a catalogue for *Cameras*. +
However, some data fields are the same in each category. Only the recommended mappings for those data fields are described here.

For *Kaufland shipping group ID*, first select the Kaufland shipping group and then assign the appropriate item data saved in plentymarkets. +
*_Note:_* The ID of the Kaufland shipping group is shown here. +

recommended mapping:

_If only one Kaufland shipping group is displayed in the catalogue:_

* *own value* +

Enter the ID of the Kaufland shipping group as value. +

*_Example:_* If the ID of the Kaufland shipping group is `35`, then enter `35` as own value.

_If more than one Kaufland shipping groups are displayed in the catalogue:_

* *Property* of the type *Text*, *Whole number*, or *Selection* +

For example, the value of the property can be the ID of the selected Kaufland shipping group.

*_Note:_* In some cases, it can be useful to assign a Kaufland shipping group to a plentymarkets shipping profile. +
However, as this mapping can be prone to errors if you use different shipping methods, such as parcel shipping and shipping company (and if both shipping profiles are linked to an item), we recommend that you rather use a property and only assign a plentymarkets shipping profile if only one shipping profile is linked to each item.

3+a| Warehouse +
*_Note:_* In the Kaufland catalogues, the mappings for *warehouses* are shown for every Kaufland account. Make sure that you map the data fields for the correct Kaufland account, i.e. the Kaufland account for which you want to use this catalogue. +
