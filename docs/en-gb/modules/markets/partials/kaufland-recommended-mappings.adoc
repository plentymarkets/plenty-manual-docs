===== Different data fields in the Kaufland product categories

You have to create a separate catalogue for each Kaufland product category that you want to offer your items in. +
Catalogues for different product categories contain different data fields. This is because different item data has to be specified in each product category. For example, you export different item data in a catalogue for *TVs* than in a catalogue for *Cameras*. +
However, some data fields are the same in each category. Only the recommended mappings for those data fields are described here.
