===== Different data fields in the Kaufland product categories

You have to create a separate catalogue for each Kaufland product category that you want to offer your items in. +
Catalogues for different product categories contain different data fields. This is because different item data has to be specified in each product category. For example, you export different item data in a catalogue for *TVs* than in a catalogue for *Cameras*. +
However, some data fields are the same in each category. Only the recommended mappings for those data fields are described here.

[TIP]
.Specify size unit as own value for length, width, and height
====
In many Kaufland catalogues, the data fields *Length*, *Width*, and *Height* are mandatory and have to be mapped. We recommend the following mappings for these data fields:

* *Variation » Length*, _specify size unit_
* *Variation » Width*, _specify size unit_
* *Variation » Height*, _specify size unit_

For these data fields, only the value is transferred to Kaufland. The size unit is not transferred to Kaufland. However, in order for your variations to be correctly exported to Kaufland, you have to specify the size unit. You should therefore additionally specify the size unit as an *own value*.

[.instruction]
Specifying the size unit as own value:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*.
. Open the Kaufland catalogue.
. Map the Kaufland data field *Length* with the value *Variation » Length*.
. Click on *Add data field* (material:insert_link[]). +
→ Another data field is added.
. Enter the size unit in the data field *Own value*. +
→ For example, you can enter *mm*, *cm*, or *m*, depending on which size unit you want to transfer.
. Click on the *Settings* (material:settings[]) for this data field. +
→ The window *Data column settings* opens. Here you can configure the separator.
. Select *Null* as *Fallback condition*.
. Select *Space* as *Separator*.
. *Save* the settings.
. Repeat the steps above for the data fields *Width* and *Height*.
