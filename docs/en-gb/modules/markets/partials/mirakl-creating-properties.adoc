Properties can be used to map the market’s data fields for which there is no designated setting in plentymarkets when exporting item data using a catalogue. To do so, create a property and then map it with the marketplace data field in the catalogue.

.What’s a property?
--
Properties can be used to provide more details about your variations. For example, you can specify technical details of a variation by creating a property, e.g. the property _Bluetooth_ for headphones. +
Moreover, you can use properties to save information which is required by the market but has no designated setting in plentymarkets. This way, when exporting item data using a catalogue, you can create properties for each marketplace data field which has no designated setting in plentymarkets. For example, if specific information about contact lenses is required by the market, you can save this information by creating properties. +
Would you like to know more about properties? For further information, refer to the xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Characteristics and properties] page.

endif::conrad,voelkner[]

ifdef::mediamarkt[]
For MediaMarkt, you need the following properties:
endif::mediamarkt[]

* Logistics class
** This is the link of a variation with a certain market shipping profile. You can see the market shipping profiles in the market back end in the *Platform settings » Shipping* menu. The value in brackets is the value that has to be transferred.
* Leadtime to ship
** The so-called _leadtime-to-ship_ is the time that a seller needs from the order acceptance to the shipping registration. Here, a whole number between 1 and 45 has to be transferred.
ifdef::conrad,voelkner[]
* Reverse charge
** This is the so-called _Reverse-charge procedure_. You can either transfer `true` or `false`.
endif::conrad,voelkner[]
* update-delete
** The option to delete an offer. If no value is selected at the variation, the market uses `update` by default.

=== Creating the logistics class property

For each variation, you need to export a shipping profile code to {market}. You can configure shipping profiles in the Mirakl back end. For a list of shipping profiles, refer to the *Platform settings > Shipping* menu in the Mirakl back end. You can find the code in the *Logistics class* column in brackets behind the name of the logistics class.

=== Creating the leadtime to ship property

You can transfer the leadtime to ship for every variation. The leadtime to ship is the time in days that a seller needs from the order acceptance to the shipping registration.
*_Note:_* You have to enter a whole number between 1 and 45 for the leadtime to ship.

[#additional-properties]
=== Creating additional properties

If you’ve defined more than one xref:item:attributes.adoc#[attribute] for any of your variations, create a property that combines these attributes. For example, if you distinguish a variation both by colour and by size, you can create a property called “Grey XL”. Then, xref:item:properties.adoc#1400[link these properties] to the respective variations.

In addition to the properties described previously, you need properties for all data fields of the marketplace whose data you want to export, but that don’t have a designated setting in plentymarkets. You can see by the data fields in the market’s catalogue which properties you need. Mandatory fields which have to be transferred to the market are marked with ***.

=== Mapping properties with data fields in the catalogue

After you have created the properties which you need for {market}, map them with the corresponding marketplace data fields in the catalogue. How to map the data fields is described in the chapter <<#map-data-fields, Mapping data fields in the catalogue>>.
