=== FAQ: Item data export


[#1302]
[.collapseBox]
.Why are my items not exported to OTTO Market?
--
[TIP]
====
One or more of your variations were not exported? First, work through the <<#2200, _checklist:_ Requirements for exporting variations>>.
====

If your variations meet all requirements and all catalogue mappings are correct, you can consult the log to find out why variations are not exported. You can find out why some of your items are not exported to OTTO Market and therefore are not available on the online market by looking at the following logs.

[.instruction]
Searching the logs:

. Go to *Data » Log*.
. From the drop-down list *Integration*, select the log *Plenty\\Modules\\Otto\\Item\\Services\\ItemExportService*. +
→ All item exports to date are shown.
. In the drop-down list *Level*, enter first *warning* and then *error* and check the results for each. +
. Open the logs containing the message *Variation invalid*. +
→ In the log, you will receive the variation ID and the reason for the rejection or the missing characteristic.
. We have listed possible error messages and solutions below this description.
. If you cannot find the variation in any of these logs, also use the following filter:
  .. *Integration*: Plenty\\Modules\\Otto\\Item\\Templates\\Mutators\\DefaultSkuMutator
  .. *Identifier*: OTTO Market

[.collapseBox]
.I want to export the unit price of my variations to OTTO. How can I do that?
--
*Requirements*: To export the unit price to OTTO, you need to save information regarding the quantity and the unit of that quantity for each variation. Open the variation and save this information in the tab *Settings*, area *Dimensions*:

For the option *Content*, you enter a *Content value* and select a *Content unit*.

In the catalogue, the following OTTO Market data fields are necessary to export the unit price:

* Sales price amount
* Unit price amount
* Unit price unit
* Sales price unit

OTTO calculates the unit price of variations based on this information. The table below provides more details on these data fields.

[cols="1,3a,3a"]
|====
|OTTO Market data field |Mapping in plentymarkets |Explanation

| Sales price amount
| * Folder *Variation*, option *Content value*
| The sales price amount is equivalent to the actual quantity or amount of the variation. As such, you need to specify the content of the variation that is saved in the variation’s dimensions.

| Unit price amount
| * Property with the values that are allowed by OTTO
| The unit price amount is used to calculate the unit price. OTTO allows the values *1*, *100* or *1000*. Map this field to a property with values of *1*, *100* or *1000*. +
*_Tip:_* If all variations for this catalogue have a unit price amount of *1*, you do not need to map the field *Unit price amount*. If the field is not mapped, the value *1* is exported by default.

| Unit price unit
| * Folder *Variation*, option *Content unit* +
Enter the ISO code of the unit into the field. +
Go to *Setup » Item » Units* to find the ISO codes in the column *ISO*. +
*_Example:_* For *Unit*, OTTO expects the value"C62".

_or_

* Property with the values that are allowed by OTTO (ISO codes)

| The unit price unit relates to the content unit saved in the variation’s dimensions.

| Sales price unit
| * Folder *Variation*, option *Content unit* +
Enter the ISO code of the unit into the field. +
Go to *Setup » Item » Units* to find the ISO codes in the column *ISO*. +
*_Example:_* For *Unit*, OTTO expects the value"C62".

_or_

* Property with the values that are allowed by OTTO (ISO codes)
| The sales price unit relates to the content value of the variation that is saved in the variation’s dimensions.

==== Item export: Error messages in the log

We have listed possible error messages in relation to the item export below.

[#13023]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: delivery.deliveryTime*
--
Check the delivery time mapped in the catalogue in the field *Delivery time in days* and the variation. In most cases, you can map the availability of your variation:

You can find a translation of the individual availability levels in the *Setup » Item » Availability* menu.
--

[#13010]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: delivery.type*
--
This error indicates that the shipping method is not linked. The shipping method can be defined via two different data fields:

* via a shipping profile
* via property

Make sure that the data field saved in the catalogue is linked to the item. For the shipping profile, activate the shipping profile in the item’s *Global* tab. For the property, activate the property for the desired variation.
--


[#13017]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: ean*
--
* Check that the variation has a EAN.
* Check that the barcode mapped in the *EAN* field of the catalogue matches the barcode type saved for the variation.
* Go to *Setup » Item » Barcode* and check that the barcode type is activated for the market OTTO Market.
--

[#1309]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: mediaAssets.IMAGE* or *mediaAssets*
--
Both these error messages usually have the same cause. This error indicates that either you did not select a data field as the source in the catalogue or that none of your item images is linked to the referrer *OTTO Market*. To do so, open an item’s *Images* tab and activate the referrer *OTTO market* as described in the <<Setting the availability for images, Setting the availability for images>> chapter.
--

[#13024]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: pricing.standardPrice.amount* or *pricing.standardPrice.currency*
--
Both these error messages usually have the same cause. Check that the catalogue field *Sales price* has been mapped to the sales price of the variation. In addition, go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices* and make sure that the sales price you mapped in the catalogue has been activated for the referrer*OTTO Market*.
--

[#1308]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: productDescription.brand*
--
This error indicates that the variation’s brand that should be exported has not been mapped in the catalogue. Make sure that a source is saved for the brand in the catalogue and that the data field is linked to the item.

The brand can be linked to the variation in two different ways:

* By mapping the Manufacturer that is saved in the *Global* tab of an item
*_Tip:_* If you want to map the manufacturer, the catalogue mapping should be *Add data field » Manufacturer » [Select manufacturer]*.
* By creating a property

*_Important:_* Select the OTTO brand from the drop-down list. Do not enter the brand yourself.

*_Tip:_* If the brand you need is not available for selection in the OTTO brands field (left side), you can register the brand with OTTO Market. Go to the OTTO Market help desk to find out more. Brands that you or other sellers register are only available in plentymarkets after the next brand update. As such, it can take up to two hours until a newly created brand can be selected in the catalogue.
--

[#13011]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: productDescription.category*
--
This error indicates that the category mapping in the catalogue is missing. In the catalogue, check whether at least one category of the desired variation is linked to an OTTO Market category.

* In the catalogue, check which data field is mapped to the marketplace data field *Category*. We recommend that you map either already existing categories (Tab: *Categories*) of your variations or properties (Tab: *Properties*).
--

[#13018]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: sku*
--
In the catalogue, check the mappings for the data fields *Parent-SKU* and *SKU*. Make sure that you have mapped at least two data fields to each of these fields, i.e. one field and one fallback field. You can find a recommendation for a possible mapping <<#13025, here>>.
--

[#13019]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: stock*
--
The variation does not have positive net stock in the warehouse that is mapped in the catalogue. If *no* warehouse is mapped in the catalogue, the sum of all sales warehouses is exported.
--

[#13025]
[.collapseBox]
.*missing requirements: sku-validation-error, validation error found* or *Duplicate entry. Combination of the fields variationId, marketId and accountId must be unique.*
--

This error is also indicated as *SKU 1234 not generated* or *0:sku* in the log.

How SKUs should be generated is defined in the catalogue. There is a distinction between the *Parent SKU* and the *Variation SKU*. The source selected here should be a data record which exists only once. As such, it is not possible to use the same SKU for different items.

For example, you could use the Item ID and the Variation ID. Both IDs are generated when the item is created and as such only ever exist once.

However, it might happen that the item export is carried out with errors because of missing information in the catalogue. The SKU is created anyway and can now be found in the *Availability* tab of a variation. During the next export, your system will try again to create an SKU from the sources selected in the catalogue. However, as this SKU already exists, the following error occurs:

* Duplicate entry. Combination of the fields variationId, marketId and accountId must be unique

* SKU 1234 not generated

As such, you need to add a fallback data field to the catalogue. The solution looks like this:

image::markets/assets/otto-market-add-source.png[Add data field]

IMPORTANT: When adding another data field, it is mandatory to use the *Add fallback data field* button (icon:link[role="yellow"]) on the right-hand side of the catalogue. Do _not_ use the option *Add data field* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) because in this case, your SKUs would be created twice and the error cannot be resolved.

This adds a *_second_* data field. During the next export, the first data field will be retrieved first. Because the SKU is already included in this source, the second data field will be ignored. If the first data field does not contain an SKU, then a new SKU will be generated using the second data field.

=== FAQ: Order processing

In some cases, errors can occur during order processing. Possible causes and frequent errors are described here.

[#13026-1]
[.collapseBox]
.Why are some orders imported without address details and with the status *[1] Incomplete data*?
--
If customers want to pay cash in advance and have not paid yet, OTTO Market assigns the status ANNOUNCED to the order. Orders with this status are imported to plentymarkets without address details and with the status *[1] Incomplete data*. As soon as the order changes to the status PROCESSABLE at OTTO Market, the address is added tot he order and the order is moved to status *[3] Waiting for payment*. +
*_Important:_* No stock is reserved for orders in status *[1] Invalid data* by default. Use the settings described below to reserve stock for these orders.

[.instruction]
Reserving stock for orders with a status of 1:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Settings*.
. Select the following options for the setting *Status for order reservation (Reservation of stocks)*:
  ** Option *from*: status *[1] Incomplete data*
  ** In the drop-down list to the far right, select the option *All orders*.
. Save the settings. +
→ Stock is reserved for orders with this status. +
*_Note:_* This setting is applied to all orders, i.e. not just to OTTO Market orders.

.How can I assign a return package to the correct order in my plentymarkets system?
--

An example of a DHL return label is provided below. The label contains all necessary data.

image::markets/assets/dhl-return-label.png[DHL return label]

--

[#incomplete-order-cancellation]
[.collapseBox]
.Why are some incomplete orders still processed and shipped even though they were cancelled?
--
*_Problem:_*

An incomplete order in *[1] Incomplete data* is cancelled because the customer requests the cancellation. However, the customer still pays the order after a few days. The order is completed, processed and automatically shipped.

*_Reason and solution:_*

* OTTO Market orders in status *[1] Incomplete data* or *[3] Waiting for payment* cannot be cancelled by the seller.
* You can only cancel OTTO Market orders once the orders have reached status *[5] Cleared for shipping*.
* OTTO Market automatically cancels incomplete orders after a few days if no payment is received.

[#1304]
[.collapseBox]
.How do I find OTTO Market orders in my plentymarkets system?
--

The *PositionID* (example: 715e9369-01e3-4d09-ae91-8688dfa139b2) and the *SalesOrderID* (example: 4245eac7-4647-4f76-8c48-261afb19aa96) are frequently mentioned in the plentymarkets forum. However, these IDs are not relevant for you as seller. You cannot see these IDs. They serve to identify an order and the order positions in the plentymarkets database.

Orders with the order referrer *OTTO Market* receive the usual order ID from your plentymarkets system. However, to identify the order, an external order number is saved for the order. With this number, the order can be clearly assigned.

Screenshots illustrating how OTTO Market orders are created in plentymarkets and in the *Mein Konto* (My account) area at OTTO Market are provided below.

image::markets/assets/otto-market_order-number.png[OTTO market order number]

The order number is saved as external order number at the order in plentymarkets.

Find a screenshot of the menu for searching the order with the external order number below:

image::markets/assets/otto-market_search_external-order-number.png[Search external order number]

The external order number can be found in the *Settings* tab of an order (*Ext. order number*):

image::markets/assets/otto-market_order-number.png[external order number in plentymarkets]

If customers have further questions concerning an order, you can find an order by searching for the external order number.

Of course, you can also use the *Referrer* filter to filter OTTO Market orders.

.One of the shipping confirmations was not sent to OTTO Market. What can I do?
--
If no shipping confirmation was sent to OTTO Market, you can check the log for possible causes.

[.instruction]
Searching the log:

. Go to *Data » Log*.
. From the drop-down list *Identifier*, select the option *OTTO Market*.
. From the drop-down list *Integration*, select the log *Plenty\\Modules\\Otto\\Order\\Services\\OrderShippingService*.
. *_Optional:_* Filter ty the order ID to limit the results:
  * *Reference type* orderId
  * *Reference value* your order ID
. In the drop-down list *Level*, enter first *warning* and then *error* and check the results for each. +
. Open the logs containing the message *Variation invalid*. +
→ In the log, you will receive the variation ID and the reason for the rejection or the missing characteristic.
. We have listed possible error messages and solutions below this description.

[#1305]
==== Order processing: Error messages in the log

We have listed possible error messages in relation to the order processing below.

[#13051]
[.collapseBox]
.*The return package nor shipping package contain a valid return tracking number.*
--
This error usually occurs if the order has a tracking number but no return tracking number (return label). Go to *Orders » Shipping centre* to check this. Return labels are shown in the *Return labels* tab of the order. If no label exists, a label must be created and a new shipping confirmation must be sent.

To send a new shipping confirmation, the event procedure with the procedure *Send shipping confirmation to OTTO* must be triggered again. Depending on the event, you might need to undo the event before triggering the event action again.
--

[#1307]
[.collapseBox]
.*Code: 200009 - ATTRIBUTE_CHANGE_DENIED* or *title: Der Wert dieses Feldes kann nicht geändert werden.* (title: The value of this field cannot be changed.)
--

These errors indicate that you changed an OTTO item attribute. However, OTTO does not accept the change and it is not possible the change the attribute for this item. The indicated attribute can relate to a variation attribute or a title attribute. Other OTTO attributes are important here, too.

TIP: An item _cannot be deleted_ at OTTO Market, neither by plentymarkets nor by OTTO. It is only possible to mark the item as *not available* at OTTO Market. Therefore, you should always make sure that the correct data fields are mapped in the catalogue prior to transferring your items.

--

[#13012]
[.collapseBox]
.*Carrier ID (X) not mapped in OTTO market config.*
--
Check whether shipping service providers were linked to OTTO Market. This is done in the *Shipping service provider* step of the *OTTO Market Basic settings* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu.
--
