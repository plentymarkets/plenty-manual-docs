You define one sales price for a market. However, in some cases you may want to offer customers cheaper prices on {market} when they buy more than one copy of the item. To do so, you create graduated prices in addition to the normal sales price. You turn a sales price into a graduated price by entering a number higher than 1 in the sales price setting *Minimum quantity*.

As such, graduated prices for {market} must have the following settings:

* *Referrer* Mirakl and {market}
* *Minimum quantity* higher than 1

Note the following when you save prices for the variation:

* The higher the setting *Minimum quantity*, the lower the price should be
