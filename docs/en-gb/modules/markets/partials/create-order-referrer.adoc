An order referrer tags an order with the sales channel on which the order was generated.

For {price-search-engine}, no order referrer is preconfigured in your plentymarkets system. Therefore, you have to create the order referrer for {price-search-engine} manually in the *Setup » Orders » Order referrer* menu.
