An order referrer tags an order with the sales channel on which the order was generated.
For {price-search-engine}, no order referrer is preconfigured in your plentymarkets system. Therefore, you have to create the order referrer for {price-search-engine} manually in the *Setup » Orders » Order referrer* menu.

.What’s an order referrer?
--
An order referrer tags an order with the sales channel on which the order was generated. Sales channels can be e.g. your online shop or markets on which you sell your items. Each sales channel has an individual order referrer. Some order referrers are available by default in your plentymarkets system. Further order referrers are added e.g. if you install a new plugin. For further information about the order referrer, see the page xref:orders:order-referrer.adoc#20[Order referrer] of the plentymarkets manual.

|Setting |Explanation

| *ID*
|Each referrer is given a unique ID. It is automatically assigned by the system and cannot be changed. The IDs 9-100 are available for order referrers that you created manually. The IDs 1-8 as well as from 101 and higher are reserved for predefined order referrers in the system. Sub-referrers are represented by a decimal ID, for example 2.08 for eBay Germany. +
_Note_: When all available IDs are assigned to manually created order referrers, the button *New* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]) is no longer displayed because no new order referrers can be added.

| *Name*
|The name entered here is displayed in the system, for example in the order search. The name can be changed at any time.

| *Internal name*
|The internal name cannot be changed and is not displayed in the system. Only predefined order referrers are given an internal name, manually created order referrers not.

| *Owner*
|Select which person should automatically be entered as owner of orders with this referrer. You can choose from all xref:business-decisions:user-accounts-access.adoc#[users who were given these rights] in the *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts* menu.

| *Activation column*
|Activate the referrer by placing a check mark. If activated, the referrer is displayed in other menus, for example in the *Settings* tab of an order. +
If you deactivate the referrer, it is no longer displayed in the system. +
You can activate or deactivate all referrers at once by clicking on *Select all* on the table header.

| *Copy online store URL*
|Copies the referrer’s URL to the clipboard. +
The URL is required for affiliate services, for example. It contains the corresponding ID as the so-called Referrer ID.

| *Open in the store* (icon:eye[role="blue"])
|A click on the preview (icon:eye[role="blue"]) opens the online store with the referrer ID added to it. All prices displayed are for the corresponding order referrer.  +
The preview can only function correctly if you have set up sales prices and activated the sales price for the referrer you wish to see a preview for. In addition, the sales price also has to be added to a variation and a value for the price must have been saved.

| *Delete*
|Click on *delete* to delete an order referrer.  You can only delete manually created order referrers. Default order referrers in the system cannot be deleted.
