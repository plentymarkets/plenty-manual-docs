If you selected the options *Create sales price*, *Create barcode* and/or *Create property* in the assistant, these prices, barcodes and/or properties are created automatically. You need to link these newly created data fields with the variations that you want to export to the market. This is described on the *Item* pages of the manual:

* How to link xref:item:prices.adoc#240[Sales prices].
* How to link xref:item:barcodes.adoc#300[Barcodes].
* How to link xref:item:properties.adoc#1420[properties and save a property value]. +
*_Tip:_* Properties created in the assistant are automatically added to the property group *{property-group}* of the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Groups* menu. Open this group to see what new properties need to be mapped.
