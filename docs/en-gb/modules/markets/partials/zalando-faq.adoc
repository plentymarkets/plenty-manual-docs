.My Zalando account has not been activated yet.
--
To activate Zalando's zDirect API interface, your Zalando account must be linked to the plentymarkets developer account. This link is established automatically during the integration. However, plentymarkets also needs to generate additional credentials for the API and then save these credentials in your plentymarkets system. As such, plentymarkets is not allowed to give you access to these credentials. +
Ask our support staff to activate your account in link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/sammelthema-aktivierung-neuer-zalando-konten/600409[this thread^] in the plentymarkets forum.

[#faq-price-update]
=== Price synchronisation

[#price-synchronisation]
[.collapseBox]
.How can I check whether prices were exported?
--
For an overview of the price updates within the last 7 days and the corresponding processing statuses, you can download reports within the *Setup » Markets » Zalando » Settings » Tab: Processing reports » Tab: Price reports* menu. Note that Zalando only receives prices when they are in the status *Submitted*. You can update the report anytime. However, the time span is fixed. +
If you notice that some prices were not updated or if you think that the values which were exported are not correct, you can also check this in the log. Go to *Data » Log*. +
Use the following filters:

    * *Integration*: Plenty\Modules\Zalando\Prices\Services\PriceUpdateService
    * *Identifier*: Zalando

Enter the *variation ID* or the *EAN* as *Reference type*. To do so, enter *variationID* or *ean* as reference type and use the corresponding value as *Reference value*. +
Afterwards, open the log entry and click on *Expand all* to look at the request. +
Whether Zalando accepted this message can be checked in the response. The response is contained in a separate log. The following screenshot contains a *jobId*:

image::markets:zalando-faq-jobid.png[jobid]

Open the *Data » Log* menu and filter for the *jobID*.

image::markets:zalando-faq-job-id-filter.png[jobid filter]

There will be messages like these:

image::markets:zalando-faq-job-id-search-results.png[search results]

Open the log entry shown in the screenshot above:

The response is contained within the *Description*.

[.collapseBox]
.How can I update the prices again for one or more variations?
--
Adjust the variation’s sales price for Zalando. To do so, slightly change the price, for example change the price by _+ 0.01_ EUR and back (_- 0.01 EUR_). Afterwards, the price will be exported to Zalando within 15 minutes. +
You can check the export of prices in the log. +
The sales price which is used as standard sales price for Zalando was defined in the assistant *Account settings - Zalando*.
--

[.collapseBox]
.How can I update the prices again for all variations?
--
To export all prices to Zalando again, the price synchronisation must be triggered. For example, this can be done in the assistant *Account settings - Zalando* in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu. You only have to make a change  in the *Prices for Germany* and/or *Prices for Austria* section. It does not matter which change you make. You can revert the change afterwards. All prices will be exported to Zalando within 15 minutes afterwards. +
You can check the export of prices in the log. +
Note that the export may be delayed if you transfer a lot of variations to different sales channels. This is due to the limitation of API calls set by Zalando. It can happen that data is exported in several packages, and therefore the export takes longer. Variations of one and the same item might also be exported in different packages. Each package contains up to 1000 variations, which make up one request. 20 requests can be sent per minute. Different packages can be distinguished by the *jobId* in the *Data » Log* menu. +

[#faq-stock-update]
=== Stock correction import

[#stock-update]
[.collapseBox]
.How can I check whether stock was exported?
--
Go to *Data » Log*. +
Use the following filters:

    * *Integration*: Plenty\Modules\Zalando\Stock\Services\StockUpdateService
    * *Identifier*: Zalando

Enter the *variation ID* or the *EAN* as reference type. To do so, enter *variationID* or *ean* as reference type and use the corresponding value as reference value. +
Afterwards, open the log entry and click on *Expand all* to look at the request. +
The stock which was exported is shown as *quantity*. +
Whether Zalando accepted this message can be checked in the response. The response is contained in a separate log. The following screenshot contains a *jobId*:

image::markets:zalando-faq-stock-job-id.png[]

Filter for it in the log again. +
Check both the marked info message as well as possible error messages. +
Why the stock was not exported to Zalando can be seen in the *description*. +
The error message _„Request contains duplicate combinations of stock quantities.“_ is usually issued if individual variations were exported twice. To check whether one variation was exported twice, check if one and the same EAN was used multiple times. If this is the case, stock cannot be exported.
--

[#stock-update-few-variations]
[.collapseBox]
.How can I update the stock again for one or a few variations?
--
To update the stock again, you have to adjust the stock of the desired variation. For example, you can change the stock from _- 1 piece_ to _+ 1 piece_. Afterwards, the stock will be exported to Zalando within 15 minutes. +
You can check the export of prices in the log. Also see <<#price-synchronisation, How can I check stock updates?>>.
Settings for stock export are carried out when first setting up Zalando with the assistant *Account settings - Zalando*.

[#faq-order-processing]
=== Order processing

In some cases, errors can occur during order processing. Possible causes and frequent errors are described here. +

To check whether an order was processed, you can use the following filters in the *Data » Log* menu.

* *Identifier*: Zalando
* *Reference type*: orderId / externalOrderId
* *Reference value*: your order ID / your external order ID

[.collapseBox]
.Shipping confirmations are missing or were not reported to Zalando. Where can I find corresponding error messages in the log?
--
If shipping confirmations were not reported to Zalando, open the *Data » Log* menu. +
Use the following filters:

    * *Integration*: Plenty\Modules\Zalando\Orders\Procedures\OrderShippingProcedure
    * *Identifier*: Zalando
    * *Level*: error

You can also additionally use the order ID or the external order ID as filter, if required:

    *Reference type*: orderId / externalOrderId
    *Reference value*: your order ID / your external order ID

[.collapseBox]
.Orders from other countries/other Zalando channels are imported with the payment method "Zalando DE". Why?
--
You probably did not create a template for order documents for the country in which the order originated. If you did not create separate order documents for a country, then the order documents are created using the template for the payment method *Zalando DE*.

*_Solution:_*

* <<#order-documents, Prepare the order documents for the country.>>
* Change the order referrer in the order manually.
* Create new order documents.

--

[#error-messages-order-processing]
==== Error messages concerning order processing

[.collapseBox]
.No return number found.
--
There may be different reasons for this:

    * _First:_ The order has a package number but no return tracking number (return label). +
    *_Analysis:_* Go to *Orders » Shipping centre* to check this. Return labels are shown in the *Return labels* tab of the order. +
    *_Solution:_* If no label exists, a label must be created and a new shipping confirmation must be sent.
    * _Second:_ The order has a return label. +
    *_Analysis:_* Check when the return label was created and when the shipping confirmation was reported to Zalando. If the return label already exists, it may only have been created after the shipping confirmation was reported to Zalando. +
    *_Solution:_* Trigger the shipping confirmation again by starting the event procedure again. Depending on the event in the event procedure, you should take different actions. If it is not possible to trigger the appropriate event, you can also create a new event procedure with another status.

=== General questions

ifndef::catalogue[]
[#updating-silhouettes]
[.collapseBox]
.The silhouettes were not updated or imported into plentymarkets.
--
Zalando sends (new) silhouettes to the plentymarkets FTP server so that they can be imported into your plentymarkets system. New silhouettes are updated every Wednesday by plentymarkets and can be converted into characteristics afterwards. +
To do so, use the *Converting silhouettes to characteristics* function. If you try to convert silhouettes to characteristics for the first time and the backend looks like this:

image::markets:zalando-faq-silhouettes.png[]

Then the reason might be that

    * Either Zalando has not yet sent any silhouettes for you _or_
    * plentymarkets has not yet imported your silhouettes.

If you already have silhouettes in your plentymarkets system and you want to convert them into characteristics, the backend looks like this:

image::markets:zalando-faq-converting-silhouettes.png[]

Select the desired groups and click on *convert to characteristics*. +
*_Tip:_* Only select the groups which you want to sell items in to keep the number of characteristics at a minimum. +
Also see <<#500, Converting silhouettes to characteristics>>.
--
endif::catalogue[]

[.collapseBox]
.Where can I find the order documents requested by Zalando?
--
Any documents requested by Zalando have to be configured according to Zalando’s requirements. The PDF templates are provided by Zalando. +
*_Note:_* As Zalando has specific requirements and you can only configure the documents globally, you should create an additional client which you only use for Zalando. This prevents your present settings from being overwritten. You can individually set up the documents afterwards. +
You can book an additional client in the *START (plentymarkets logo) » My account » Contracts* menu. +
How to set up you documents is described on the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[Setting up documents] page.
