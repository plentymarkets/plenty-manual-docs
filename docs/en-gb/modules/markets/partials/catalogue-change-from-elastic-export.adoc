Do you already export item data to {market} with the elastic export and want to change to the catalogue export? To do so, create a catalogue as described in the chapter <<#catalogue-export, Catalogue export>>.

[IMPORTANT]
.Exactly recreate elastic export
====
To make sure that the item export still works after you switched from the elastic export to the catalogue, you need to exactly recreate your elastic export in the catalogue. That means that you need to map the same data fields in the export that are currently exported to the price search engine with the elastic export. If you map different data fields than in the elastic export, new items my be created during the export.
====

To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend the following steps:

. Check which characteristics you currently use for {market}. Characteristics and free text fields cannot be used for the catalogue export. So create properties for all characteristics that you still need. +
*_Important:_* The values of the new properties must be identical to the values of the old characteristics. Otherwise, new items may be created during the export to {market}.
. Create a catalogue for {market}. (<<#catalogue-creation, How?>>)
. Map the same plentymarkets data fields to the {market} marketplace data fields that are currently exported to {market} with the elastic export. (<<#data-field-mappings, How?>>) +

. Did you filter item data in the elastic export? If so, use the same filters in the catalogue. (<<#filter-export, How?>>)
. Carry out the export settings. This allows you to create a URL for {market}. (<<#catalogue-settings, How?>>)
. Activate the catalogue (<<#catalogue-activation, How?>>)
. Save the URL of the catalogue at {market}. (<<#catalogue-url, How?>>)
