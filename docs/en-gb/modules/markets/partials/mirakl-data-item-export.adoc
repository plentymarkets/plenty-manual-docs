[#item-export-catalogue]
== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to {market} via marketplace catalogues. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues. Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, basic concept of the plentymarkets catalogues first>>.

If you want to sell your products in multiple {market} product categories, create a separate catalogue for each of them. Link the {market} data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. Once you’ve activated a catalogue, plentymarkets automatically exports the catalogue templates to {market} on a daily basis.

[IMPORTANT]
.Error log
====
If there’s a problem during export, you can find the related log entries on Mirakl and not the plentymarkets log.

[#map-data-fields]
=== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. Check the documentation of the sales channel to find out what data the market expects for the individual data fields.

[TIP]
.Using properties
====
Use <<item/settings/properties#500, properties>> to export values for marketplace data fields that have no corresponding field in plentymarkets.
====

include::_textblocks/catalogues/instructions/catalogue-mapping.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not map plentymarkets data fields to the following marketplace data fields for the market {market}:

ifdef::conrad[]
* Product image 1
* Product image 2
* Product image 3
* Product image 4
* Product image 5
endif::conrad[]

ifdef::voelkner[]
* Product image 1 URL
* Product image 2 URL
* Product image 3 URL
* Product image 4 URL
* Product image 5 URL
endif::voelkner[]

You can ignore the warning shown when you save the mapping.

[TIP]
.Datenfelder zur Grundpreisangabe pflegen
====
The two data fields *Gross content quantity for unit price specification* and *Unit of unit price specification* are not marked as mandatory fields, but they have to be maintained and transferred due to the legal requirement to specify the unit price.
A list with valid values is not available for both data fields. We recommend, however, to map the attribute *Gross content quantity for unit price specification* with the plentymarkets data field *Content quantity* and create a property for the attribute *Unit of unit price specification* and save the values at the variations, for example “g” for *gramme*.

[#additional-properties]
=== Creating additional properties

If you’ve defined more than one <<item/settings/attributes#, attribute>> for any of your variations, create a property that combines these attributes. For example, if you distinguish a variation both by colour and by size, you can create a property called “Grey XL”. Then, <<item/settings/properties#1400, link these properties>> to the respective variations.

In addition to the <<markets/conrad/first-steps#create-properties, properties described previously>>, you need properties for all data fields of the marketplace whose data you want to export, but that don’t exist in plentymarkets by default. You can see by the data fields in the catalogue which properties you need. Is this your first time working with properties? For further information, refer to the item <<item/settings/properties#500, Properties>> page.

The link:{valid-values-zip}[{market}: valid values^] ZIP file contains CSV files for each marketplace attribute. Each CSV file contains the valid values for the respective attribute. During mapping, always use the value in the *Code* column.
