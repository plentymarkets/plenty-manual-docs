.What is a sales price?
--
xref:item:prices.adoc#100[Sales prices] define the conditions under which a variation is sold at a specific price and on a specific sales channel. For example, you can sell your items at a lower price in your webshop than on Amazon. Or you can sell products cheaper to B2B customers than to B2C customers.

Two default sales prices are already configured in your plentymarkets system. However, you can also create new sales prices and edit them individually. In addition to default sales prices, you can also create *RRPs*, *special offers*, and *set prices*.
