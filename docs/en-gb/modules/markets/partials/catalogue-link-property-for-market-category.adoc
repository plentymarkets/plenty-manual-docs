After you created the first marketplace format for {market} with the assistant {catalogue-assistant-name}, the property *{property-name}* is created in your plentymarkets system.

In addition, a first property value is created for the property. This property value has the same name as the {market} product category that you created the catalogue for.

Each time you create a new catalogue for {market}, a new selection value is added to the property *{property-name}*. This selection value has the same name as the {market} product category.

The property *{property-name}* determines in which {market} product category a variation is published. To do so, link the variation to the appropriate property value of the property *{property-name}*.

[.instruction]
Linking a variation with the property for {market} product categories:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. Open the *Variation properties* section.
. From the drop-down list *Properties*, select the property *{property-name}*.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is added.
. For the property *{property-name}*, select the desired category group from the drop-down list *Value*. +
*_Tip:_* Product categories are only added as a selection value for the property after you have created a catalogue for this {market} category. +
ifdef::otto-market[*_Note_* The export to OTTO Market contains the name of the catalogue, not the name of the marketplace format. +]
→ The variation is listed in this {market} product category. +
ifdef::otto-market[*_Example:_* If you select the property value *Betten* (Beds), then the variation will be exported in the catalogue for the OTTO category group *Betten*. +]
