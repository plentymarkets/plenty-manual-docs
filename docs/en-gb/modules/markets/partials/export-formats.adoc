By installing this plugin you will receive the export format *{export-format}*. Use this format to exchange data between plentymarkets and {price-search-engine} using the elastic export. You need to install the plugin *Elastic export* from the plentyMarketplace before you can use the format in plentymarkets.

Once both plugins are installed in your plentymarkets system, you can create the export format *{export-format}*. For more information on export formats, see the <<data/exporting-data/elastic-export#, elastic export>> page.

{price-search-engine} retrieves item data via an URL. To make sure that your item data can be exported to {price-search-engine}, you have to save the URL at {price-search-engine}.
