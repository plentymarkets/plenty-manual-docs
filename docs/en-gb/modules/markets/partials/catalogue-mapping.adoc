|Availability |Explanation

| *Navigation*
| When you open a catalogue, the view *Mapping* is shown. On the very left is the navigation. 

* Switch to other views of the catalogue.
* Open the catalogue settings. 
* Use filters that limit the data that is exported.
* Go back to the list of catalogues.
* Create a new catalogue.

| *Toolbar*
| The toolbar provides actions for the catalogue. For example, save your mappings, restore an older version of the catalogue or hide or show optional marketplace data fields.

| *Marketplace data field*
| To the right of the navigation, all data fields available for the market are listed. Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk (✱). +
*_Tip:_* Show or hide optional marketplace data fields in the toolbar. To do so, click on the further actions (material:more_vert[]).

| *plentymarkets data fields*
| On the right side of the catalogue, you map the marketplace data fields to appropriate plentymarkets data fields. In the screenshot above, a few of the fields are already mapped.

.*Simple 1:1 mapping:* 1 marketplace data field, 1 plentymarkets data field
--

In a simple 1:1 mapping, you map a plentymarkets data field to the marketplace data field. If no suitable setting exists in plentymarkets, you can map a property instead.

As such, simple 1:1 mappings allow you to:

* I want to fill this marketplace data field with the data from this plentymarkets setting.
* If the data field is empty for a variation, no value is exported for this variation.

[.instruction]
Creating a simple 1:1 mapping:

//tag::simple-mappings-config[]
. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Click on the group you need. +
→ The plentymarkets data fields of the group are shown.
. Click on the plus to the right of the plentymarkets data field you want to select. +
→ The plentymarkets data field is added to the right.
. Click on *Confirm*.

*_Example:_* Sales price and RRP for Otto Market

This gif shows you how to map the marketplace data fields *Sales price* and *RRP* for Otto Market to plentymarkets data fields:

Reminder: In a simple 1:1 mapping, you map a plentymarkets data field to the marketplace data field. However, what can you do if plentymarkets does not offer a suitable data field? Then it's the properties' moment to shine. Properties allow you to save any kind of information in your properties.

* Is this your first time working with properties? Then read up on the xref:item:properties.adoc#500[principles of properties first].

[.instruction]
Creating a property:

. Create a property with the necessary values. +
*_Tip:_* Find out how to do that xref:item:properties.adoc#500[here].

[.instruction]
Creating a simple 1:1 mapping with properties:

//tag::property-mappings-config[]
. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Expand the group *Property*. +
→ The property groups are shown.
. Expand the group you need.
. Click on the Plus sign on the right of the property you want.
. From the drop-down list *Language*, select the language in which you send the data to the market.
. Click on *Confirm*. +
→ The property is mapped to the marketplace data field.

//end::property-mappings-config[]

.*Complex 1:1 mapping:* 1 marketplace data field, 1 plentymarkets data field
--

//tag::complex-mappings[]
Like with the simple 1:1 mappings, you map a plentymarkets setting or property to a marketplace data field. Complex mappings are necessary whenever a marketplace data field has more than one possible value. Instead of mapping data fields, for complex mappings you map individual values of these data fields. For example, you cannot simply map the plentymarkets data field *Shipping profile* to the marketplace data field *Shipping method*. Why? The market cannot know which of your shipping profiles in plentymarkets corresponds to which of their shipping methods.

IMPORTANT: Do not enter own values for complex mappings. All values that you enter must be saved for the variations, either in a setting or as a property value. This also applies if the value *Comparative value* is shown. You still need to enter exactly the value of the setting or property that you mapped.

In complex mappings, the value of the market is always exported. Only when you map an own value, the own value that you enter is exported.

You can recognise complex mappings from the field that is shown below the name of the marketplace data field. Click on the field to show the values available for the marketplace data field.

image::markets:catalogue-complex-mappings.png[]

Examples for complex 1:1 mappings are:

* Categories
* Brands
* Shipping setting

*_Important:_* For complex mappings, do not map own values or properties of the type *None*.

//end::complex-mappings[]

[.instruction]
Creating a complex 1:1:n mapping:

//tag::complex-mappings-config[]
. Click on the field for the marketplace data field. +
→ A list of the available values is shown.
. Select the value that you want to map a plentymarkets data field to. +
→ The value is mapped.
. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the available plentymarkets data fields are listed in groups. +
. Click on a group. +
→ The plentymarkets data fields of the group are shown.
. Click on the plentymarkets data field for which you want to map values. +
*_Important:_* Do not map own values or properties of the type *None*. +
. Your next steps depend on the plentymarkets data field you selected:

* *_Alternative 1:_* The available values for the plentymarkets data value are shown on the left. +
  ** Next to the value you want to select, click on the plus. +
  → The value is added to the field on the right.
  ** Click on *Confirm*.
* *_Alternative 2:_* The plentymarkets data field is inserted and the field *Comparative value* is shown.
  ** In the field *Comparative value*, enter a value that is saved in the setting or the property of the mapped plentymarkets data field. +
  ** Click on *Confirm*.
* *_Alternative 3:_* The plentymarkets data field is inserted and a drop-down list is shown.
  ** Select a value from the drop-down list.
  ** Click on *Confirm*. +
→ The value of the marketplace data field is exported, not the value of the plentymarkets data field. +
*_Exception:_* Only when you map an own value, the own value that you enter is exported.

*_Example:_* Delivery time in days for Otto Market

This gif shows you how to map suitable plentymarkets values to the values of the marketplace data fields *Delivery time in days* for Otto Market:

.*1:1 mapping with fallback data fields:* 1 marketplace data field, 1 plentymarkets data field with alternative(s)
--

In a 1:1 mapping with one or more fallback data fields, you map a plentymarkets data field to the marketplace data field. In addition, you specify one or more fallback data fields. This ensures that the system keeps looking if the first plentymarkets data field is missing or empty.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to fill the marketplace data field with the data from the selected plentymarkets setting.
* If that data field is missing or empty for a variation, the first fallback data field is checked. The value of that fallback data field is exported instead.
* If the first fallback data field is also missing or empty for the variation, the second fallback data field is checked. If a value is found, the value of the second fallback data field is exported for the variation etc.

Two separate fallback conditions are available:

[cols="1,4a"]
|===

| *Null (default)*
| The fallback data field is used if the data field above is mapped in the catalogue but not linked to the variation.

The condition "Null" is useful when you want to map fallback data fields for the following types of plentymarkets data fields:

* SKU
* Barcodes
* Sales prices
* Properties

*_Important:_* When you add a fallback data field, the fallback condition "null" is selected automatically. To apply the fallback condition "leer", you need to change the default setting.

| *Empty*
| The fallback data field is used if the data field above is mapped in the catalogue and linked to the variation, but is empty.

The condition "Empty" is useful when you want to map fallback data fields for the following type of plentymarkets data fields:

* plentymarkets data fields that are available for variations by default

*_Important:_* When you add a fallback data field, the fallback condition "null" is selected automatically. To apply the fallback condition "leer", you need to change the default setting.

|===

*_Note:_* Even if you assign one or more fallback data fields, the value of only one of those fields is exported. For each variation, the mapped plentymarkets data fields are checked in the order in which you mapped them. This means that if the first data field does not provide a value for a variation, the first fallback data field is exported etc.

[.instruction]
Creating a 1:1 mapping with fallback data fields:

//tag::fallback-mappings-config[]
. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Click on the group you need. +
→ The plentymarkets data fields of the group are shown.
. Click on the plus to the right of the plentymarkets data field you want to select. +
→ The plentymarkets data field is added to the right.
. In the list of plentymarkets data fields, click on the plus icon next to the plentymarkets data field that you want to map. +
→ The fallback data field is added with the fallback condition "null".
. *_Alternative 1:_* To add the fallback data field with the fallback condition "null":
.. Click on *Confirm*. +
→ The fallback data field is exported if the data field above is not linked to the variation.
. *_Alternative 2:_* To add the fallback data field with the fallback condition "empty":
.. To the left of the fallback data field, click on the cog (icon:cog[role="darkGrey"]). +
→ The window *Data column settings* is shown.
.. For the setting *Fallback condition*, select the option *Empty*.
.. Click on *Save*. +
→ The fallback data field is added with the fallback condition "empty".
.. Click on *Confirm*. +
→ The fallback data field is exported if the data field above is empty for the variation.

_Example:_ Fallback data field for SKU for Otto Market

This GIF shows you the mapping for the OTTO Market marketplace data field *SKU*. The plentymarkets data field *SKU* is mapped to this marketplace data field. The plentymarkets data field *Variation ID* is mapped as the fallback data field. The fallback condition "null" is applied automatically.

*_Result:_* The fallback data field *Variation ID* is exported if the data field *SKU* is not linked to the variation.

.*1:n mapping:* 1 marketplace data field, several plentymarkets data fields
--

In a 1:n mapping, you map several plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data field. You can link these data fields with a separator.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to combine these plentymarkets data fields during export so that the marketplace data field is filled with the data of these two or more plentymarkets settings.

[.instruction]
Creating a 1:n mapping:

//tag::1-to-n-mappings-config[]
. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Click on the group you need. +
→ The plentymarkets data fields of the group are shown.
. Click on the plus to the right of the plentymarkets data field you want to select. +
→ The plentymarkets data field is added to the right.
. Click on *Confirm*.
. To the right of the mapped plentymarkets data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]). +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields again are shown in groups.
. Map one or several additional plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data field as described above.
. Click on *Confirm*.
. To the very right of the row, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. Select a separator from the drop-down list *Separator* or add a custom separator.
. Click on *Save*.
. Save (terra:save[role="darkGrey"]) the catalogue. +
→ The mappings are saved. +
→ During the export, the content of the plentymarkets data fields is combined and exported as one field.

.*Own value mapping:* 1 marketplace data field, the same value for all variations
--

You are sure that you want to export the same value for all variations of a catalogue for a marketplace data field? Then specify an own value. This own value is then exported for all variations.

So this mapping specifies:

* For this marketplace data field, I want to export the value that I entered in the field *Own value* for _all_ variations of this catalogue. The value you enter is always exported. The value overwrites the market value also in complex mappings where usually the value of the market is exported. As such, make sure you enter an own value that the market accepts for this marketplace data field.

[.instruction]
Creating an own value mapping:

//tag::own-mappings-config[]
. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Click on the plus next to *Own value* at the top of the list. +
→ The field for the own value is added to the view.
. Enter a value into the input field. +
→ This value is exported for all variations.

*_Example:_* Diameter information

You want to export diameter information for some of your variations. The diameter is saved in centimetres for all your variations. Instead of creating a property for the unit and linking this property to the variations, you can enter the own value `cm`.

This is an example of how you can map an own value for the diameter unit:

.*Mapping with mathematical calculations:* 1 Marketplace data field, the plentymarkets value is recalculated using the formula during export
--

//tag::formula-config[]
Mathematical calculations allow you to change numerical values automatically during the export.

* This function only works for data fields that contain numerical values.
* This functionality is new and not available for all catalogue formats.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want the numerical value of a plentymarkets data field to be recalculated during the export. Basic arithmetic operations are available for the formulas.

[.instruction]
Recalculating numerical values:

. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. At the very top of the list, click on the plus icon next to *Formula* (material:calculate[]). +
→ The data field *Formula* is added to the field on the right.
. Click into the data field. +
→ The window *Modify value* is shown.
. Enter a numerical value or select a plentymarkets data field at the bottom right of the window to add it to the calculation (material:add[]). +
*_Tip:_* Use the search function. This helps you to find data fields quickly.
. *_Optional:_* If the symbol material:more_vert[] is shown in the data field, select the correct assignment for the data field. +
*_Tip:_* A number tells you how many assignments are necessary for the data field.
    .. Click on the icon material:more_vert[]. +
    .. In the window shown, select the assignments from the drop-down list.
    .. *Save* the settings.
. Enter numbers and mathematical operators with the on-screen calculator or the keyboard.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The entered formula is displayed in the overview. +
→ The calculation will be carried out in the next export.

.Assigning own data fields: 1 own data field, 1 plentymarkets data field
--

You want to transfer item data that do not have a designated data field in the market’s catalogue? Then you have the possibility to create own data fields and assign them to item data saved in plentymarkets.

*_Note:_* Own data fields are not transferred automatically to the market. During the export, the market decides whether the data field should be included in the product catalogue.

[.instruction]
Creating an own data field:

. In the navigation, click on *Own data fields* (terra:order_return_create_edit[]). +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Click on the plentymarkets data field that you want to assign. +
→ *_Tip:_* It is possible to assign more than one data field. The data fields assigned here will then be combined during the export.
. Enter a name for the own data field into the *Export key* field. +
→ The data field will be exported to the market with this name.
. *_Optional:_* Enter a value for *Comparative value*. +
→ Comparative values can be entered for most, but not for all plentymarkets data fields. Comparative values are only required in specific cases. However, in most cases, you can leave the field empty. +
*_Example:_* If you map a property *Brand*, you could for example enter the brand name as *Comparative value*.
. **_Optional:_* Select a fallback data field, if desired. +
→ The fallback data field is exported when the first data field does not exist or is empty.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings after you have created your own data fields.
