__Menu structure of a catalogue with marketplace format__

The areas you see are:

* *Navigation* When you open a catalogue, the view *Mapping* is shown by default. Use the navigation to switch to other views of the catalogue. Access the catalogue settings or set filters to only export specific data. You can also go back to the catalogues overview or create a new catalogue.

* *Toolbar* The toolbar provides actions for the catalogue. For example, save your mappings, restore an older version of the catalogue or hide or show optional marketplace data fields.

* *Marketplace data fields* To the right of the navigation, all data fields available for the market are listed. Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk (*). +
*_Tip:_* Click on the further actions (icon:more_vert[set=material]) in the toolbar to show or hide optional data fields .

* *plentymarkets data fields* The left side of the catalogue is where you map the marketplace data fields with suitable plentymarkets data fields. In the screenshot, a few of the fields are already mapped.

[.instruction]
Mapping catalogue fields:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*.
. Click on the catalogue. +
→ The *Mapping* tab opens. +
ifdef::amazon-flatfile[]
*_Note:_* The catalogue may appear to be empty at first. Depending on the size of the flatfile, it may take several minutes before the data fields are loaded and shown. +
endif::amazon-flatfile[]
→ In the left-hand column, the market's data fields are listed. +
*_Tip:_* Mandatory fields are flagged with an asterisk (*). +
ifdef::bol.com[]
*_Note:_* Some data fields are mapped by default when you create a catalogue. +
endif::bol.com[]
→ In the right column, you map the plentymarkets data fields. Any plentymarkets data fields that are already assigned are also shown in the right column.
. Now, map suitable plentymarkets data fields to the market data fields. +
You can choose from the following mappings which are described in the info boxes below:
  * *Simple 1:1 mapping*
  * *Complex 1:1 mapping*
  * *1:1 mapping with fallback data fields*
  * *1:n mapping*
  * *Own value mapping*
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the catalogue. +
→ The mappings are saved.

.*Simple 1:1 mapping:* 1 marketplace data field, 1 plentymarkets data field
--

In a simple 1:1 mapping, you map a plentymarkets data field to the marketplace data field. If no suitable setting exists in plentymarkets, you can map a property instead.

As such, simple 1:1 mappings allow you to:

* I want to fill this marketplace data field with the data from this plentymarkets setting.
* If the data field is empty for a variation, no value is exported for this variation.

[.instruction]
Creating a simple 1:1 mapping:

. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Click on a group to expand the associated plentymarkets data fields. +
→ The plentymarkets data fields are shown.
. Click on the plus to the right of the plentymarkets data field you want to select. +
→ The plentymarkets data field is added to the right.
. Click on *Confirm*.

*_Example:_* Sales price and RRP

.*Complex 1:1 mapping:* 1 marketplace data field, 1 plentymarkets data field
--

Like with the simple 1:1 mappings, you map a plentymarkets setting or property to a marketplace data field. Complex mappings are necessary if a marketplace data field has more than one possible value. Instead of mapping data fields, for complex mappings you instead map the values of these data fields. For example, you cannot simply map the plentymarkets data field *Shipping profile* to the marketplace data field *Shipping method*. This is because the market cannot know which of your shipping profiles in plentymarkets corresponds to which of their shipping methods.

IMPORTANT: Do not enter own values for complex mappings. All values that you enter must be saved for the variations, either in a setting or as a property value. This also applies if the value *Comparative value* is shown. You still need to enter exactly the value of the setting or property that you mapped.

Examples for complex 1:1 mappings:

* Categories
* Brands
* Shipping setting

You can recognise complex mappings from the field that is shown below the name of the marketplace data field. Click on the field to show the values available for the marketplace data field.

image::markets/assets/catalogue-complex-mappings.png[]

[.instruction]
Creating a complex 1:1:n mapping:

. Click on the field for the marketplace data field. +
→ A list of the available values is shown.
. Select the value that you want to map a plentymarkets data field to. +
→ The value is mapped.
. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the available plentymarkets data fields are listed in groups. +
. Click on a group. +
→ The plentymarkets data fields are shown.
. Click on the plentymarkets data field for which you want to map values. +
*_Important:_* Do not map own values. +
→ Your next steps depend on the plentymarkets data field you selected.

* *_Alternative 1:_* The available values for the plentymarkets data value are shown on the left. +
  ** Next to the value you want to select, click on the plus. +
  → The value is added to the field on the right.
  ** Click on *Confirm*.
* *_Alternative 2:_* The plentymarkets data field is inserted and the field *Comparative value* is shown.
  ** In the field *Comparative value*, enter a value that is saved in the setting or the property of the mapped plentymarkets data field. +
  ** Click on *Confirm*.
* *_Alternative 3:_* The plentymarkets data field is inserted and a drop-down list is shown.
  ** Select a value from the drop-down list.
  ** Click on *Confirm*.

This gif shows you how to map suitable plentymarkets values to the values of the marketplace data fields *Delivery time in days* for Otto Market:

.*1:1 mapping with fallback data fields* 1 marketplace data field, 1 plentymarkets data field with alternatives
--

In a 1:1 mapping with fallback data fields, you map a plentymarkets data field to the marketplace data field. In addition, you specify one or more fallback data fields. This ensures that the system keeps looking if the first plentymarkets data field is empty or contains an invalid value.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to fill this marketplace data field with the data from this plentymarkets setting.
* If the data field is empty or invalid for a variation, the first fallback data field is checked and the value of that fallback data field is exported instead.
* If the first fallback data field also is empty or invalid for a variation, the value of the second fallback data field is exported and so on.

[.instruction]
Creating a 1:1 mapping with fallback data fields:

. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Click on a group to expand the associated plentymarkets data fields. +
→ The plentymarkets data fields are shown.
. Click on the plus to the right of the plentymarkets data field you want to select. +
→ The plentymarkets data field is added to the right.
. In the list of plentymarkets data fields, click on the plus icon next to the plentymarkets data field that you want to map. +
→ The fallback data field is exported when the first data field does not exist or is empty. +
*_Note:_* Even if you assign one or more fallback data fields, the value of only one of those fields is exported. For each variation, the mapped plentymarkets data fields are checked in the order in which you mapped them. This means that if the first data field does not provide a value for a variation, the first fallback data field is exported etc.
. Click on *Confirm*.

This gif shows you how to map the plentymarkets data field *SKU* and the fallback data field *Variation ID* to the marketplace data field *SKU* for Otto Market:

.*1:n mapping:* 1 marketplace data field, several plentymarkets data fields
--

In a 1:n mapping, you map several plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data field. You can link these data fields with a separator.

So this mapping specifies:

* I want to combine these plentymarkets data fields during export so that the marketplace data field is filled with the data of these two or more plentymarkets settings.

[.instruction]
Creating a 1:n mapping:

. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Click on a group to expand the associated plentymarkets data fields. +
→ The plentymarkets data fields are shown.
. Click on the plus to the right of the plentymarkets data field you want to select. +
→ The plentymarkets data field is added to the right.
. Click on *Confirm*.
. To the right of the mapped plentymarkets data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]). +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields again are shown in groups.
. Map one or several additional plentymarkets data fields to the marketplace data field as described above.
. Click on *Confirm*.
. To the very right of the row, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. Select a separator from the drop-down list *Separator* or add a custom separator.
. *Save* the settings.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the catalogue. +
→ The mappings are saved. +
→ During the export, the content of the plentymarkets data fields is combined and exported as one field.

.*Own value mapping:* 1 marketplace data field, the same value for all variations
--

You are sure that you want to export the same value for all variations of a catalogue for a marketplace data field? Then specify an own value. This own value is then exported for all variations.

So this mapping specifies:

* For this marketplace data field, I want to export the value that I entered in the field *Own value* for _all_ variations of this catalogue.

[.instruction]
Creating an own value mapping:

. Next to the marketplace data field, click on *+ Add data field*. +
→ To the left, the list of available plentymarkets data fields are shown in groups.
. Click on the plus next to *Own value* at the top of the list. +
→ The field for the own value is added to the view.
. Enter a value into the input field. +
→ This value is exported for all variations.

*_Example:_* Diameter information

You want to export diameter information for some of your variations. The diameter is saved in centimetres for all your variations. Instead of creating a property for the unit and linking this property to the variations, you can enter the own value `cm`.

This is how you can map an own value for the diameter unit:
