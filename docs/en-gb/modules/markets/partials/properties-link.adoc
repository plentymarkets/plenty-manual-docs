All properties, sales prices and barcodes that you have created for mapping them in the catalogue now need to be linked to the variations that you want to export to the market. This is described on the *Item* pages of the manual:

* How to link xref:item:properties.adoc#1420[properties and save a property value].
* How to link xref:item:prices.adoc#900[Sales prices].
* How to link xref:item:barcodes.adoc#300[Barcodes].
