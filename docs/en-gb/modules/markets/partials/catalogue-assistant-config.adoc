*_Note:_* You have to select a catalogue generator for MyToys. The *catalogue generator V2* will replace the old catalogue generator in the future. We therefore recommend that you start using the catalogue generator V2 now.
endif::mytoys[]
. In the step *Summary*, check your settings to make sure they are correct. +
*_Tip:_* In the *Summary* step, click on the arrow (icon:chevron-down[role="darkGrey"]) to show the settings.
. If everything is as it should be, click on icon:check[role="green"] *Finalise*. +
→ The catalogue is created.
. Open the catalogue in the *Data » Catalogues* menu to map {mapping-fields} fields. +
*_Note:_* {catalogue-note}

*_Note:_* You should not change the *format* in the catalogue's *Format settings*. To ensure that the export to the market works, all required settings are already configured when you create a catalogue. If you change the settings, errors might occur during the export.
