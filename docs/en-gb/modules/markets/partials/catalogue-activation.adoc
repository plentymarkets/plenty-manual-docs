You have set up {market} in plentymarkets and created a catalogue for exporting your item data? Then start the export of your item data. To do so, activate the catalogues which should be exported to {market} in the *Data » Catalogues* menu.

ifdef::mytoys[]
*_Note:_* Catalogues which were created using the old catalogue generator (type *MyToys*) and catalogues which were created using the catalogue generator V2 (type *MyToys_NEW*) should not be active at the same time. If both formats are active at the same time, the catalogues will overwrite each other. This may result in the wrong data being exported to MyToys.
