.The wrong stock was exported for one or more variations. What can I do?
--

First, check the stock settings: Does the problem only affect variations without stock limitation?

*_How can I recognise variations without stock limitation?_*

. Open the variation: *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Availability*.
. Check the setting for the drop-down list *Limitation*.
. If this set to either *None* or *Do not administer stock for this variation*? Then the variation has no stock limitation. +
*_Tip:_* You can also filter variations in the item overview. Set the filter *Stock limit* first to *No limitation* and then to *Do not administer the stock*. Only variations without stock limitation are shown. This allows you to find patterns in the variations that were not exported.


*_How do I check that the settings for variations with no stock limitation are correct?_*

. Open the assistant *Setup » Assistants » Plugins » [Select plugin set] » Assistant: {assistant-name}*.
. Navigate to the step *Offer export settings*.
. Check that the following settings are correct:
  * The setting *Replace stock amount for items not limited to stock* is active.
  * The field *Quantity for items not limited to stock* contains a number that is higher than 0.
. Modify the settings as needed.

*_Important:_* Offers for variations without stock limitations are exported to {market} once daily during the night. As such, variations are not exported immediately when you correct these settings.
