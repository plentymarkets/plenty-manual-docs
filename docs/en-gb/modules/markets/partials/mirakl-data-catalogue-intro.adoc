Item data is exported to {market} via marketplace formats. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues.

* Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, basic concept of the plentymarkets catalogues first>>.

If you want to sell your products in multiple {market} product categories, create a separate catalogue for each of them. Link the {market} data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. Once you’ve activated a catalogue, plentymarkets automatically exports the catalogue templates to {market} on a daily basis.
