Item data is exported to {market} via catalogues. For {market}, you create catalogues with the *{assistant-name} Catalog* assistant.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

Create a separate marketplace format with the *{assistant-name} Catalog* assistant for each {market} product category in which you want to sell your items. Afterwards, link the {market} data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format that you created. +

Once you activated a catalogue, plentymarkets automatically exports the catalogue templates to {market} on a daily basis. How to activate a catalogue is described in the <<#catalogue-activation, Activating the catalogue export>> chapter.
