[cols="1,3"]
!===
! *Status [1]* +
(incomplete data)
! The order is incomplete and the status must be changed after editing the order.

(Waiting for payment)

!===

*_Note:_* You can also change the order status for individual listings in the listing settings. The setting for the individual listing takes priority over the setting that is chosen here.

| *Default order status for orders containing unknown items (ID: -2)*
| Which status do you want to assign to orders if no item is found in plentymarkets for one or more order items?

Possible statuses:

* *Status 2* (Waiting for activation)
* *Status 3* (Waiting for payment)

*_When do orders contain unknown items?_*

Unknown order items are imported with the item ID *-2*. Unknown means that no related item for the order item is found in plentymarkets. Possible reasons are:

* You’ve been selling your items on the market for some time. However, you have not yet created items for all your products in plentymarkets.
* You have created an item directly on the market that does not exist in plentymarkets.
* An item was sold on the market that was deleted in plentymarkets in the meantime.

| *Item names in order items*
| Which item name is to be used in order items?

[cols="1,2"]
!===
! *Copy item name from the market*
! The item name of the market is used.

! *Copy item name from the store*
! The item name for your online shop is exported.
!===

| *Down-selling in the checkout process*
| Should customers be able to reduce the quantity purchased on eBay in plentymarkets?

* *Enable* = Customers can reduce the quantity purchased on eBay in plentymarkets.
* *Disable* = Customers are not able to reduce the quantity purchased on eBay in plentymarkets. +
*_Note:_* Up-selling is always possible for fixed-price items.
//support

| *The quantity purchased at eBay listings (no fixed price items) can be changed by the customer during checkout (up-selling and down-selling)*
| Select *Yes* or *No*. +
*_Important:_* Neither up-selling nor down-selling is possible if you selected *No*. This is even true if you selected *Enable* for the option *Down-selling in the checkout process*.
//support

| *Shipping costs for new orders coming from eBay*
a| Select *Transfer from eBay* or *Have it calculated by plentymarkets*. +

* *Transfer from eBay* = New orders are transferred as open transactions. +
* *Have it calculated by plentymarkets* = New orders are automatically imported every 15 minutes and the shipping costs are calculated.

| *Shipping costs for items purchased during checkout*
| Select *Regular*, *No further shipping costs* or *Yes, but with online store shipping costs*.

| *Item assignment after sale*
a| Select one of the following options: +

* *Automatically* +
* *No automatic assignment based on title* +
* *No automatic assignment* +
* *Automatic assignment based on title only* +
* *Assignment based on external item ID* +
* *Assignment of SKU to variation number* +

If a listing could not be assigned or should not be assigned, the item ID *-2* is used.

| *Also import orders with incomplete checkout process* +
 +
(previously *Automatically combine open eBay orders*)
| Should orders where the customer has not completed the checkout process be imported? If so, after what period? +
*_Important:_* The setting is only visible if the option *Shipping costs for new orders coming from eBay* is set to *transfer from eBay*. +
*_Note:_* If you use eBay's checkout process (eBay Payments), we recommend to select the option *Never* because the information required for a smooth checkout process will only be transferred from eBay after the customer completed the checkout process. +
*_Tip:_* You also have the possibility to manually import open orders. For further information, refer to the <<Synchronising data, Synchronising data>> chapter.

[#listings-sales-planner]
=== Setting up the listing scheduler

//tag::listings-sales-planner[]
With plentymarkets, you can automatically place listings on the market at a certain time and you can automatically restart finished listings. Use the listing scheduler to set up these automatic procedures. Listings can be linked to several listing schedulers.

If you want plentymarkets to automatically start listings at a certain time, you can define time intervals in the listing scheduler. Either select *days of the week* or up to three *days of the month* in the listing scheduler. In both cases, you also have to choose *starting times* for the listing.

* The listing scheduler only adds a listing to the future listings if no entry exists for the MLID and if there is no active or hidden listing for this MLID.
* On eBay, a maximum of one auction with 0 bids can be visible at once. +
*_Example:_* +
You have 10 active listings for a MLID. All listings have 0 bids. As such, only one of the 10 listings is visible to end customers. +
As soon as the offer receives its first bid, a new offer is published. +
As such, you then have 1 auction with 1 bid and 1 auction with 0 bids.

[.instruction]
Setting up the listing scheduler:

. Go to *Setup » Listings » Scheduler*.
. Click on *Create new listing scheduler*.
. Carry out the desired settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#settings-scheduler>>.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

| Setting | Explanation

| *Name*
| Enter a name for the listing scheduler.

| *Lister*
| Activate or deactivate listings with this listing scheduler.
//Research

| *Runtime*
| Select *use listing runtime* or select one of the given runtime options in days. +
*_Important:_* If a runtime in days is selected for the listing scheduler, this runtime will always be used for the listing, even if a different runtime has been entered in the settings of the individual listing.

| *Start times*
| Define one or several daily starting times. +
*_Important:_* For technical reasons, if you select several starting times, then they all have to be at least 60 minutes apart from each other.

| *Distribution*
| In which intervals should the listings be published that are linked to this listing scheduler? The number of listings to be started with the listing scheduler is divided by the selected number of minutes. +
*_Example:_* If the value 120 minutes was selected for the distribution of 10 listings, then one listing would be started every 12 minutes.

| *Day*
| Select up to three days of a month from the drop-down lists. The listings are published on these weekdays. +
*_Note:_* Select either *Days of the week* or between one and three *Days of the month*.

| *Weekday*
| Activate the *days of the week* that the listings should be started on. +

[#listings-layout-templates]
=== Managing layout templates

//tag::manage-layout-templates[]
Use layout templates to give listings a certain layout. The advantage of such a template is that you use plain text only in the actual item description without any design elements. Thus, layout templates reduce the need for maintenance of the item description. Furthermore, basic and general information such as the legal disclosure and shipping information can be saved in the layout template. When adjusting the layout template, these adjustments are applied to all listings linked to this template. In plentymarkets, you can create and adjust as many layout templates as you like.

The content that you want to display for listings can be saved using template variables and functions in the *Main frame* tab in the *Setup » Listings » Layouts* menu. The content is structured with HTML and CSS. The different tabs are described below.

Also watch this video for an overview of how to create or import layout templates for your listings:

.Layout templates

[IMPORTANT]
.Commissioning third-party providers
====
HTML and CSS skills are necessary to create a layout template. We recommend that you commission a service provider to create a layout template if you are not experienced in doing so. Go to *Setup » Listings » Layouts* to import a layout template to plentymarkets that was created externally.
