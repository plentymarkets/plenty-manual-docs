[TIP]
.Other catalogue settings are optional
====
In addition to the basic settings, the catalogue settings also contain options for *Format settings*, *Export settings* and *Download settings*. These optional settings allow you to create a file with the item data that is exported to the market at regular intervals. If you do not want to create such a file, you can ignore the settings. These settings do not impact the export to the market.
