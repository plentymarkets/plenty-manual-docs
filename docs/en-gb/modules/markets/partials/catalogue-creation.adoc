===== Other catalogue settings

Other catalogue settings are optional. Once you carried out the settings described on this page, your catalogue is automatically exported to {market}. That means you can ignore the catalogue settings for *Format settings*, *Export settings* and *Download settings*.

The *Format settings*, *Export settings*, and *Download settings* allow you xref:data:export-marketplace-formats.adoc#file-export[to create a file with the variation data contained in the catalogue]. However, this file does not contain information about whether the data export to {market} was successful.
