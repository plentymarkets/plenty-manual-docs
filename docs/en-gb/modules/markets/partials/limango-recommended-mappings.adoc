4+^| Category

| Category
| yes
| * *Category*

Only one category is exported per product. However, due to technical reasons, the default category of a variation cannot be determined during the export. If more than one category is linked to a main variation, a check is run to determine which of these categories is mapped to a limango data field in the catalogue. If more than one category is mapped in the catalogue, the first mapped category in the catalogue’s category list is exported. If you want to export a different category, change the order of the mappings in the catalogue.

*_Important:_* If the variations of the same item have different material mixes, deactivate the inheritance function for properties and save the material mixes separately for each variation. However, note that this deactivates the inheritance for all properties for the item. As such, you also need to manually manage all other properties for each variation.
