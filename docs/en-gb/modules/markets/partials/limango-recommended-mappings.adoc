| Category +
(_mandatory field_)
| * *Category*

Only one category is exported per product. However, due to technical reasons, the default category of a variation cannot be determined during the export. If more than one category is linked to a main variation, a check is run to determine which of these categories is mapped to a limango data field in the catalogue. If more than one category is mapped in the catalogue, the first mapped category in the catalogue’s category list is exported. If you want to export a different category, change the order of the mappings in the catalogue.

_If necessary, add different shades of the same colour as fallback data fields:_

The colour value is equivalent to the colour filter of the limango shop. However, limango only distinguishes by colour, not by colour shades. For example, if you offer a dress in both light and dark green, both are presented if customers search for green dresses on the market.

To ensure that different products are created for variations in different shades of the same colour, the colour value saved in plentymarkets is exported as part of the merchant product ID and the product name instead of the limango colour value.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Mapping different shades of green to the colour value *green*
--
Imagine that you want to map your own shades of green to the limango colour *green*.

[.instruction]
_Assumed scenario:_

You want to map all your shades of green to the limango colour value *green*.

Some shades of green are saved as values of the attribute *Colour*:

* Light green
* Dark green

Other shades of green are saved as property values:

* Lime green
* Coriander

[.instruction]
Mapping different shades of green to the colour value "green":

. Open the limango catalogue.
. Navigate to the area *Colour*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Colour* to the following plentymarkets data fields: +
  * *_Data field:_* Field *Value name* of the attribute for *Colour* +
  * *_Fallback data field:_* Property for *Colour*
. Navigate to the area *Colour value*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Colour value: green* to the plentymarkets attribute value *Light green*.
. Click on *+ Add fallback data field*.
. As the first fallback data field, map the plentymarkets attribute value *Dark green*.
. Click on *+ Add fallback data field*.
. As the second fallback data field, map the plentymarkets property value *Lime green*.
. Click on *+ Add fallback data field*.
. As the third fallback data field, map the plentymarkets property value *Coriander*. +
→ The shade of green that is saved for the variation is exported as part of the merchant product ID and the product name. +
→ On limango, all products are listed with the colour Green. +
*_Tip:_* The order for mapping the different shades described here is random. You can map the values in any order.

For variations with different material mixes:

*  Property linked to variation +
*_Important:_* If the variations of the same item have different material mixes, deactivate the inheritance function for properties and save the material mixes separately for each variation. However, note that this deactivates the inheritance for all properties for the item. As such, you also need to manually manage all other properties for each variation.
