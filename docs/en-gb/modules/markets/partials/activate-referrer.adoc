.What is an order referrer?
--
//tag::order-referrer-definition[]
An order referrer tags an order with the sales channel on which the order was generated. Sales channels can be e.g. your online shop or markets on which you sell your items. Each sales channel has an individual order referrer. Some order referrers are available by default in your plentymarkets system. Further order referrers are added e.g. if you install a new plugin. For further information about the order referrer, see the page xref:orders:order-referrer.adoc#[Order referrer] of the plentymarkets manual.

ifdef::emag[]
The following order referrers are available for eMAG:

* 169.00 eMAG = All eMAG markets
* 169.01 eMAG Romania = eMAG Romania
* 169.02 eMAG Bulgaria = eMAG Bulgaria
* 169.03 eMAG Hungary = eMAG Hungary

If you want to sell your items on all eMAG country platforms for which you have created an account in plentymarkets, activate only the parent origin for eMAG (*160.00 eMAG*). Your items will then be available on all eMAG country platforms.
If you only want to sell your items on specific eMAG country platforms, then only activate those referrers.
