.What is an order referrer?
--
An order referrer tags an order with the sales channel on which the order was generated. For example, sales channels can be your plentyShop or markets on which you sell your items. Each sales channel has an individual order referrer ID. Some order referrers are available by default in your plentymarkets system. Other order referrers are added when you install a new plugin. For further information about order referrers, see the page xref:orders:order-referrer.adoc#20[Order referrer] of the plentymarkets manual.
