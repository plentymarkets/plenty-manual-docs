If you’ve defined more than one <<item/settings/attributes#, attribute>> for any of your variations, create a property that combines these attributes. For example, if you distinguish a variation both by colour and by size, you can create a property called “Grey XL”. Then, <<item/settings/properties#1400, link these properties>> to the respective variations.

In addition to the <<markets/conrad/first-steps#create-properties, properties described previously>>, you need properties for all data fields of the marketplace whose data you want to export, but that don’t exist in plentymarkets by default. You can see by the data fields in the catalogue which properties you need. Is this your first time working with properties? For further information, refer to the item <<item/settings/properties#500, Properties>> page.
