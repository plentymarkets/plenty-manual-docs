.What is a catalogue?
--
Catalogues are used to export data from your plentymarkets system. There are two different catalogue formats:

* *Marketplace formats* are used to export item data to markets.
* *Standard formats* are used to export data from your plentymarkets system into a file.

Catalogues with marketplace formats allow you to tailor your item information exactly to the needs of the market. Because here, you assign a suitable plentymarkets data field to each of the data fields of the market. When your variation data is exported to the market, the marketâ€™s data fields are then filled with the correct plentymarkets data.
