|Setting |Explanation

| *Do you want to use Zalando Fulfillment Solutions?*
| Activate the toggle button to use Zalando Fulfillment Solutions. +
*_Note:_* You need to have a contract for Zalando Fulfillment Solutions in order to use this service.

*_Background:_* Zalando Fulfillment Solutions is a service in which Zalando ships the orders to your customers. You send your items to Zalando and Zalando takes care of the storage and the shipment to your customers.

| *Match warehouses* +
(only if +
*Use Zalando Fulfillment Solutions*)
| Now assign plentymarkets warehouses to the different Zalando locations (countries). 

There is a Zalando Fulfillment warehouse your items can be stored in each country that you can select here. Assign plentymarkets warehouses to these Zalando warehouses. This provides an overview of the Zalando locations your items are stored in. The stock from the Zalando locations is transferred to your plentymarkets warehouses.

*_Recommendation:_* Create new warehouses for Zalando Fulfilment Solutions.

You can either specify a default warehouse only or a default warehouse and additional warehouses for each Zalando channel.

[.instruction]
_Possibility 1:_ Only specify a default warehouse

. For the setting *Default warehouse for Zalando ZFS*, select a plentymarkets warehouse form the drop-down list. +
-> Stock data for all Zalando ZFS warehouses are imported to this warehouse. +
*_Important:_* If you do not assign any other warehouses, the stock data from all Zalando locations will be imported to this warehouse. 

[.instruction]
_Possibility 2:_ Specify a default warehouse and additional warehouses for each Zalando channel

. For the setting *Default warehouse for Zalando ZFS*, select a plentymarkets warehouse.
. At the bottom right, click on (material:add[]) to assign further warehouses.
. From the *Zalando* drop-down list, select a country.
. From the drop-down list *plentymarkets warehouses*, select a warehouse. +
-> Stock data from this country are imported to the selected warehouse. +
*_Note:_* You can only assign _one_ plentymarkets warehouse to each Zalando location.
. If necessary, click on (material:add[]) at the bottom right again to map additional warehouses. +
-> Stock data for Zalando locations that are not mapped to a plentymarkets warehouse are imported to the default warehouse. +
*_Example:_* Create a warehouse *Zalando Germany*. To this warehouse, map the Zalando location *Deutschland*. This allows you to check the stock that Zalando holds for you in Germany at any time.

.Steps *Channel settings*

Each country has a separate Zalando sales channel. Zalando activates you for the channels that you agreed upon in your contract. In the assistant, a separate step *Channel settings* is added for each country. The settings are the same for all countries.

*_Don't see any steps for the channel settings?_* Then your account has not been linked to the zDirect account yet. (<<#link-zDirect, What do I need to do?>>) +
*_Is a country missing?_* The countries are updated once a day. So when Zalando activates a new country for you, it can take up to 24 hours before that country is available in plentymarkets.

| The quantity you enter in the * Stock buffer*field is deducted from the net stock of each variation before export.

| *Stock for variations without positive net stock and without stock limitation*

*_Tip:_* The price reports contain information on the status of price updates.

<<#915, How to download price reports>>

| *Ignore warnings of Zalando on price updates*
| During price updates, Zalando checks the plausibility of your prices based on specific criteria. For example, Zalando compares the prices of the same variations on different platforms and compares the regular price with the reduced price. If any significant differences are detected, Zalando triggers a warning. Select if such warnings should be ignored when prices are updated.

* icon:toggle-on[role="blue"] = The new prices are published even if Zalando sends a warning.
* icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] (default setting) = Zalando rejects new prices if they do not pass the plausibility checks. +
*_Tip:_* Check the *Data » Log* menu and the price reports for warnings.

| *Regular price*
| Select the sales price from the drop-down list that you want to export to Zalando as the regular price. You can select from sales prices of the types *Default* or *RRP* for which the referrer Zalando, the country and the currency of the country are activated. +
*_Note:_* If you specify a *reduced price* for a variation, the *regular price* is exported to Zalando as the strikethrough price.

|*Reduced price*
|Select the sales price from the drop-down list that you want to export to Zalando as the reduced price. You can select from sales prices of the types *Offer price* or *Default* for which the referrer Zalando, the country and the currency of the country are activated. +
*_Note:_* If you specify a *reduced price* for a variation, the *regular price* is exported to Zalando as the strikethrough price.

| *Planned price 1* +
to +
*Planned price 3*
| Use scheduled prices to announce any temporary or permanent price changes to Zalando ahead of time.

Define up to three scheduled prices. Scheduled prices ensure that Zalando really changes your prices at the specified time. To export scheduled prices to Zalando, you need at least a sales price for the regular price and a property that contains the start date and time for the new price. The start date for scheduled prices must be in the future. You can also select a property for an end date for a scheduled price.

* *Regular price* = Select the sales price from the drop-down list that you want to export to Zalando as the *Scheduled price*.
* *Reduced price* = Select the sales price from the drop-down list that you want to export to Zalando as the reduced price for the planned price. +
*_Note:_* If you specify a *reduced price* for a variation, the *regular price* is exported to Zalando as the strikethrough price.
* *Property for start date* = Select the property from the drop-down list that you use to manage the start time for your variations. You can only select properties of the types *Date* or *Text*. +
*_Note:_* The start times of more than one scheduled prices must be separated by at least 60 minutes.
* *Property for end date* (optional) = Select the property from the drop-down list that you use to manage the end time for your variations. You can only select properties of the types *Date* or *Text*.
