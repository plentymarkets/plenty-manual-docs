== Creating properties

Using properties, you can export fields to the marketplace that aren't defined in plentymarkets by default. You can create the properties that are specified by {marketplace} in the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration* menu.

For further information on properties, refer to the <<item/settings/properties#500, Characteristics and properties>> page.

For {marketplace}, you need the following properties:

* Logistics class (Logistikklasse, <<#1210, click for details>>)
* Leadtime to ship (Versandvorlaufzeit, <<#1220, click for details>>)
* Reverse charge (<<#1230, click for details>>)

[#1210]
=== Creating the logistics class property

For each variation, you need to export a shipping profile code to {marketplace}. You can configure shipping profiles in the Mirakl back end. For a list of shipping profiles, refer to the *Informations » Carrier costs* menu in the Mirakl back end. You can find the code in the *Logistics class* column in brackets behind the name of the logistics class.

:property: Logistics class (Logistikklasse)

include::../../_textblocks/properties/instructions/properties-creation.adoc[]

:property: Logistics class (Logistikklasse)
:property-area: Item
:property-type: Text
:property-name: {marketplace} logistics class

include::../../_textblocks/properties/instructions/properties-creation-table.adoc[]

[#1220]
=== Creating the leadtime to ship property

For each variation, you need to export a leadtime to ship in days to {marketplace}. This way, you can tell {marketplace} how many days you need to ship a variation. {marketplace} accepts values between 1 and 45.

:property: Leadtime to ship (Versandvorlaufzeit)

include::../../_textblocks/properties/instructions/properties-creation.adoc[]

:property: Leadtime to ship (Versandvorlaufzeit)
:property-area: Item
:property-type: Text
:property-name: {marketplace} leadtime to ship (Versandvorlaufzeit)

include::../../_textblocks/properties/instructions/properties-creation-table.adoc[]

[#1230]
=== Creating the reverse charge property

For each variation, you need to specify if the reverse charge mechanism applies to this variation for cross-border business processes. {marketplace} accepts the values *true* and *false*.

* false = The reverse charge mechanism isn’t applied.
* true = The reverse charge mechanism is applied. This means that instead of you, your customers have to pay VAT to the tax authorities. +
*_Note:_* Observe the legal requirements for the reverse charge mechanism and consult your tax adviser on the details.

:property: Reverse charge

include::../../_textblocks/properties/instructions/properties-creation.adoc[]

:property: Reverse charge
:property-area: Item
:property-type: Text
:property-name: {marketplace} reverse charge

[#1300]
== Generating the API key

To create the connection for {marketplace} between plentymarkets and Mirakl, you need an API key. To generate the API key, proceed as follows:

[.instruction]
Generating the API key:

. Open the Mirakl back end.
. Click on the user icon (icon:user[]).
. Go to the *API keys* tab.
. Generate a new API key for {marketplace}.
. Copy the API key to your clipboard. You need this key to set up your {marketplace} account in plentymarkets.

== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to {marketplace} via marketplace catalogues. Go to *Data » Catalogs* to create catalogues.

* Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the basic concept of <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, catalogues first>>.

If you want to sell your products in multiple {marketplace} product categories, create a separate catalogue for each of them. Link the {marketplace} data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. Once you’ve activated a catalogue, plentymarkets automatically exports the catalogue templates to {marketplace} daily.

[IMPORTANT]
.Error log
====
If there’s a problem during export, you can find the related log entries on Mirakl and not the plentymarkets log.
====

[#1240]
=== Creating additional properties

In addition to the properties described <<#1200, previously>>, you need properties for all data fields of the marketplace whose data you want to export, but that don’t exist in plentymarkets by default. For further information on the properties you need, check the documentation of the marketplace. Is this your first time working with properties? For further information, refer to the <<item/settings/properties#500, Properties>> page of the manual.

[#475]
== Linking variations to a {marketplace} catalogue category

After you created a marketplace format for {marketplace} with the *{marketplace}* assistant or manually, the property *{marketplace}* is created in your plentymarkets system. A new selection value is added to the *{marketplace} category group* property for each category selected in the *Settings* step of the assistant. In order for your variations to be exported in the appropriate catalogue, they have to be linked to the *{marketplace} category group* property in the *Properties* tab of a variation.

[.instruction]
Linking a variation to a category:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Variation properties* area, select the property *{marketplace} category group* from the *Properties* drop-down list and click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is added.
. Select the desired category group from the *Value* drop-down list for the *{marketplace} category group* property. +
→ The variation will be exported in this catalogue. +
*_Example:_*If you pick the value *{category-example}*, the catalogue variation is exported for the *{category-example}* category.
. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all categories where you want to offer the variation.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#480]
== Setting up event procedures

Set up an <<automation/event-procedures#, event procedure>> to automatically update the order status on {marketplace} whenever specific events occur. You can set up the following event procedures:

// Welche Ereignisaktionen es gibt hängt vom Marktplatz ab. Hier die gängigsten. Bei Bedarf anpassen!

ifeval::["{marketplace}" == "Conrad"]
include::../automation/mirakl-conrad.adoc[tag=summary]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{marketplace}" == "Voelkner"]
include::../automation/mirakl-voelkner.adoc[tag=summary]
endif::[]

How to set up the event procedures in plentymarkets is described in the following chapters.

[IMPORTANT]
.Additional procedures
====
In addition to the event procedures listed above, the {marketplace} plugin provides several other event procedures. These procedures exist because order processing differs between plentymarkets and Mirakl.

However, we recommend that you only use the procedures described in detail.
