=== Item export: Error messages in the log

When this error occurs, variation data is still exported to {market}. Only variations with this error are not exported.

[.collapseBox]
.Age group muss ausgefüllt sein / Produkt hat kein Feld Altersgruppe
--

*_Problem:_*

* A value for the age group must be saved for the variation. The values `Babys` (babies), `Kinder` (children) and `Erwachsene` (adults) are possible.

*_Solution:_*

. Open the catalogue and check which plentymarkets properties you mapped to the marketplace data field *Age group*. +
  *_Tip:_* Map either a property of the type *Selection* or of the type *Text*. You cannot map properties of the type *None*.
. Open the variation and check the following:
    * Is the variation linked to this property?
    * Is a valid value saved for the variation?
    * If the property is linked to the main variation: Does the inheritance work as intended? +
    *_Tip:_* Inheritance can only be activated or deactivated for _all_ properties of a variation.

.No valid image found
--
*_Problem:_*

* The variation must be linked with at least one image.

*_Solution:_*

[.collapseBox]
.Size muss ausgefüllt sein
--
*_Problem:_*

* No valid size was found for this variation. Most likely, the sizes of the variation do not match the data fields mapped in the catalogue.

*_Solution:_*

. Open the variation and check the following:
  * What size does the variation have? Is the size defined with an attribute or a property?
. Open the catalogue and check the following:
  * Which plentymarkets data field have you mapped to this size for the marketplace data field *Size*?
  * Is the value of the attribute or property that you mapped also saved for the variation?

*_Tip:_* The value *onesize* must be exported for products without a specific size. Did you do that correctly?

[.collapseBox]
.Color is not set on the variation
-- 
*_Problem:_*

This error message relates to the marketplace data field *Colour value* and/or *Colour*.

*_Solution 1:_*

Check the mapping for the marketplace data field *Colour value*: You have probably mapped an attribute or a property. However, the mapping must be at the level below this one. That means that you have to map the _values_ of a property or an attribute and _not_ the property or attribute itself.

*_Solution 2:_*

Check that you mapped a property value to all colour values that you need. In practice, this means:

* Open the catalogue. Check which plentymarkets data fields are mapped to the marketplace data fields *Colour value* and *Colour*.
* Open the variations with this error message one by one:
  ** Does the variation have the property value/attribute value for *Colour value*?
  ** Does the variation have the property value/attribute value for *Colour*?
* If necessary, map the variation to one of the property values that are mapped in the catalogue.

[.collapseBox]
.The value has a length of ...; this exceeds the allowed maximum length of ‚80‘.
--

*_Problem:_*

* The product name of the variation is too long.

*_Solution:_*

* The product name can be up to 80 characters long. Shorten the product name. +
*_Important:_* Spaces are also counted.

.EnergyEfficiency’: Missing child element(s). Expected is one of ( {http://schema.limango.de}EnergyLabel, {http://schema.limango.de}DataSheet
--

*_Problem:_*

* Lamps and luminaires with light sources not intended to be removed by the end-user must be labelled. The following information must be exported for these products:

* URL to energy label
* URL to energy data sheet

*_Solution:_*

. Open the catalogue and check which plentymarkets properties you mapped to the marketplace data fields *Energy label URL* and *Energy data sheet URL*.
*_Tip:_* Map either a property of the type *Selection* or of the type *Text*. You cannot map properties of the type *None*.
. Check the following for the variation:
    * Is the variation linked to these properties?
    * Is a valid value saved for the variation?
    * If the property is linked to the main variation: Does the inheritance work as intended? +
    *_Tip:_* Inheritance can only be activated or deactivated for _all_ properties of a variation.

--

*_Problem:_*

The stock can only be specified as whole numbers. However, you probably exported the stock information for the variation as a decimal number.

*_Solution:_*

* Check the variation. Deactivate the referrer *{market}* or specify the stock in whole numbers.
