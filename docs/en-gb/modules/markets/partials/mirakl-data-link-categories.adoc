//TODO: Is there a better include for this?

After you created a marketplace format for {market} with the *{assistant-name} Catalog* assistant, the property *{market} category group* is created in your plentymarkets system. With this property, you define in which category your variations are sold on {market}.

In the first step *Settings* of the assistant *{assistant-name} Catalog*, you select a {market} category for each catalogue. Each of these categories is added as a selection value to the property *{market} category group*.

In order for your variations to be offered in the desired category on {market}, they have to be linked to the *{market} category group* property in the tab *Properties* of the variation. Afterwards, select the category in which your variations should be offered for this property.

Linking a variation to a category:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Variation properties* area, select the property *{market} category group* from the *Properties* drop-down list and click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is added.
. Select the desired category group from the *Value* drop-down list for the *{market} category group* property. +
→ The variation will be exported in this catalogue. +
*_Example:_* If you pick the value *{category-example}*, the variation is offered in the *{category-example}* category on {market}.
. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all categories where you want to offer the variation.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

*_Further possibilities to link variations:_*
