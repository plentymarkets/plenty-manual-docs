=== Setting up Amazon IDU

VCS is an optional service. If you activate this service in Amazon Seller Central, Amazon calculates the VAT for your Amazon orders.

You can only upload invoices to Amazon after a shipping confirmation was sent to Amazon.

[.instruction]
Activating Amazon IDU in plentymarkets:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » [Select Amazon account] » Tab: Settings*.

. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ plentymarkets calculates the VAT for Amazon orders. +
→ Invoices for Amazon orders are created by plentymarkets. +
. Set up the event procedure described below to upload invoices to Amazon.

Set up the following event procedure to upload invoices created by plentymarkets as well as invoices created with an external software to Amazon. However, invoices created by plentymarkets always take priority over external invoices. This means that all invoice documents are checked and if invoices created by plentymarkets are found, they are uploaded first. If there is no plentymarkets invoice, the external invoice will be uploaded to Amazon.

=== Troubleshooting: Manually uploading invoices

If all your settings for the invoice creation are correct, invoice information is exchanged with Amazon automatically. Were not all invoices for your Amazon orders uploaded to Amazon?

* Make sure that you have set up the upload of invoices for Amazon orders correctly as described in this chapter.
* If all settings are correct and only some invoices are missing, you can upload these invoices to Amazon manually. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Manually uploading invoices to Amazon:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports*.
. Open the tab *Upload invoices*.
. From the drop-down list *Order ID type*, select the option *Order ID*. +
*_Tip:_* If part shipments exist in the system, not all invoices are uploaded when you select the option *Amazon order ID*. As such, we recommend the option *Order ID*.
. Enter the ID of the invoice. +
*_Tip:_* Enter more than one order ID separated by commas.
. Click on *Apply* (icon:cog[]). +
→ plentymarkets starts to upload any missing invoices for valid orders to Amazon.

=== Troubleshooting: Unlocking VCS orders for manual invoice creation

//tag::unlock-vcs-oders[]
When you use the VCS service, you do not generate invoice documents yourself. Instead, all order documents are generated automatically when the VCS reports are imported. As such, orders are locked for manual invoice generation. However, in some cases you need to manually generate invoices for VCS orders:

* Amazon is the customer.
* You did not save a VAT identification number (VATIN) for the country in which the order originated in Seller Central.
* The order is not really a VCS order and was imported retroactively. This happens if the order was placed before you activated VCS but imported after you activated VCS.

In such cases, you need to unlock the VCS orders manually. This allows you to generate the necessary invoice documents.

NOTE: VCS reports still have the highest priority. That includes unlocked orders for which you have manually generated invoice documents. If Amazon sends invoice documents in a subsequent VCS report, the invoices you generated are cancelled and a new invoice is generated.

[.instruction]
Unlocking VCS orders:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Reports*.
. Open the tab *Unlock VCS orders*.
. In the drop-down list *Order ID type*, select if you want to enter the *Amazon order ID* or the plentymarkets *Order ID* to search for the orders.
. In the field *Order ID list*, enter the ID of the orders. To enter several IDs, separate them by commas.
. Click on *Unlock VCS orders* (icon:execute[set=plenty]). +
→ The *Results* area shows how many orders were unlocked. The table shows the status of each order. +
→ You can manually generate invoice documents for the unlocked orders. +
*_Important:_* If Amazon transfers their own documents in a subsequent VCS report, the invoice documents that you created manually will become invalid: As a result, your invoice documents are cancelled and a new invoice is created.
