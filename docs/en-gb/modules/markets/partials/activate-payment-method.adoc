Customer classes allow you to divide your customer base according to specific criteria. Examples of use for customer classes are:

* Create two separate customer classes for end customers (B2C) and business customers (B2B) respectively. Depending on the customer class, customers either see net prices or gross prices in your plentyShop.
* Give discounts to specific customer classes.

For more information about customer classes, head over to the to the xref:crm:preparatory-settings.adoc#create-customer-class[Managing contacts] page.
