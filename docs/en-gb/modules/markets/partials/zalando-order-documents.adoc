For each country, you need the following order documents for Zalando orders:

* Delivery notes
* Invoices
* Return slips
* Return flyer

NOTE: If you did not create separate order documents for a country, then the order documents are created using the template for the payment method *Zalando DE*.

The payment method you select in the template settings determines the country the template is used for. Here, we show you how to prepare documents for the sales channel Zalando DE. This information is structured like this:

* <<#delivery-notes, Preparing delivery notes for Zalando DE>>
* <<#invoices, Preparing invoices for Zalando DE>>
* <<#return-notes, Preparing return slips for Zalando DE>>
* <<#return-flyers, Preparing return flyers for Zalando DE>>

This information is accurate as of 1st of March 2022. Consult the link:https://partnerportal.zalando.com/partners/s/article/Delivery-Documentation[documentation for Zalando Partners] to find out if the requirements have changed.
Current templates for order documents for all Zalando platforms are available on link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lhAU2lfUWgWsRmTJFRP_VXilj2bSsm19[Zalando’s Google Drive].

NOTE: You can use a separate PDF template for each payment method and order document. However, for each client and document type, the settings for the document templates need to be configured globally. As such, all delivery notes for one client have the same layout. If you sell on different markets with strict requirements, you might want to consider creating a separate client for {market}.

[#multilingual-payment-methods]
=== _Special case:_ Preparing order documents for Austria, Belgium and/or Switzerland

You can only specify one order document for each combination of payment method and language in plentymarkets. However, Zalando requires separate mandatory details for order documents for each country. For example, there are different bank details and links to FAQs for each country. This leads to problems when the same language is spoken in several countries or when several languages are spoken in the same country.

As such, you need separate payment methods for the following countries:

* Austria (AT)
* Belgium (BE)
* Switzerland (CH)

Separate payment method allow you to create separate templates for order documents for these countries.

Note the following points:

* The payment methods for Austria, Belgium and Switzerland only become visible in the document menu after Zalando activates the platform for your Zalando account. +
*_Important:_* For technical reasons, it can take up to 24 hours after activation before the payment method becomes available in the plentymarkets back end.
* The payment method is only saved for incoming orders if you have created a template for this payment method. It does not matter for which client, language or document a template is saved. If a template is saved for any document for a payment method, this payment method is assigned to incoming orders from that country.
