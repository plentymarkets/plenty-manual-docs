* In the tab *Template* of the document type, remove all optional fields. For mandatory fields, specify coordinates outside of the visible document area.

[#multilingual-payment-methods]
=== _Special case:_ Preparing order documents for Austria, Belgium and/or Switzerland

You can only specify one order document for each language in plentymarkets. However, Zalando requires different mandatory details for order documents for each country. For example, there are different bank details and links to FAQs for each country. This leads to problems when the same language is spoken in several countries or when several languages are spoken in the same country.

As such, you need separate payment methods for the following countries:

* Austria (AT)
* Belgium (BE)
* Switzerland (CH)

Separate payment method allow you to create separate templates for order documents for these countries.

Note the following points:

* The payment methods for Austria, Belgium and Switzerland only become visible in the document menu after Zalando activates the platform for your Zalando account. +
*_Important:_* For technical reasons, it can take up to 24 hours after activation before the payment method becomes available in the plentymarkets back end.
* The payment method is only saved for incoming orders if you have created a template for this payment method. It does not matter for which client, language or document a template is saved. If a template is saved for any document for a payment method, this payment method is assigned to incoming orders from that country.
