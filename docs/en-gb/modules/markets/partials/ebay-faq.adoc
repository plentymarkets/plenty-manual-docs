=== Second Chance Offer

[.collapseBox]
.Is stock taken into consideration or reserved for SCOs?
--
No, stock is not reserved for eBay second chance offers. You can define a *minimum net stock* that is kept, but no reservation is made. We recommend that you use the function *End offers automatically*. Open the *Setup » Listings » Stock* menu in order to activate this function. Enabling this function means that every 15 minutes, the system checks the stock of active auctions with no stock reservation, as well as the stock of Second Chance Offers. As soon as the stock of the item reaches *0*, the offer is terminated.
--

[.collapseBox]
.Do I have to pay insertion fees to submit SCOs?
--
There are no insertion fees for SCOs. ou may only need to pay the final value fee in case of a successful sale. For further information about the current prices, refer to the link:https://www.ebay.co.uk/help/selling/listings/selling-auctions/making-second-chance-offers?id=4142[information^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] provided by eBay.

[.collapseBox]
.Overselling has become a problem since I started using SCO. How can that be?
--
Check if the *End offers automatically* function is activated in the *Setup » Listings » Stock* menu of your plentymarkets system. Auctions with no stock reservation are only checked every 15 minutes, and SCOs make up a part of these auctions too. As such, overselling might occur in some cases.
--

[.collapseBox]
.How often are Second Chance Offers submitted?
--
plentymarkets checks the terminated auctions every 15 minutes to see whether SCOs can be submitted for these auctions. This guarantees that SCOs are sent shortly after an auction has ended. +
If there is currently not enough stock, then an error message is displayed in the SCO overview. If it is determined that there is not enough stock to send SCOs, then they are automatically sent as soon as new stock is booked into the system. If the stock runs out while sending SCOs, then an error message is displayed in the SCO overview. Later on, after stock has been booked, you can manually send SCOs to the rest of the defeated bidders (both options are possible up to a maximum of 60 days after the auction has ended).
--

[.collapseBox]
.The item is no longer available in the main warehouse but is still available in other warehouses. Will SCOs be submitted?
--
Yes, the SCO function is based on the total stock from all warehouses.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I upload my items to eBay using attributes without attribute links. My customers select the colour / size in the checkout. Are SCOs submitted for these items?
--
Yes. plentymarkets uses the total stock of all item variations for auctions without attribute links. *No reservations* are possible in doing so.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I upload my items to different eBay platforms and use different currencies. Which currency should I define the minimum price for SCOs in?
--
Always use the standard currency of your plentyShop (go to *Setup » Orders » Payment » Currencies*). The price that was defined is first converted into the currency of the auction before an SCO is submitted to a defeated bidder. If no conversion rate was defined for this currency, then an error message is displayed in the *SCO* menu. Here you can manually submit an SCO afterwards. Note that the bids in the *SCO* menu are always displayed in the *currency used for the particular auction*.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the error message *No answer, eBay exceeded the maximum response time (limit).* What can I do?
--
It is possible that eBay will temporarily not respond to messages from plentymarkets. The most common reasons are capacity overloads and server or internet connection failures. In this case, try to submit an SCO manually.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the error message *\#956 Second Chance Offers already sent to all eligible non-winning bidders.* What can I do?
--
There is no need to take action. plentymarkets was able to successfully submit an SCO, but the confirmation from eBay has not been received yet (this often occurs in combination with the error message quoted above). It usually takes 30 minutes maximum before this error message disappears and the corresponding eBay SCO auction number is displayed.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the internal error *Net stock of item 2, current SCO of item 1, keep minimum net stock of 1, net stock does not allow further SCOs.* What can I do?
--
Book the missing stock. Then, submit an offer to defeated bidders manually using the *Submit SCO* function.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the internal error *Unable to convert auction currency into standard currency. Maximum bid of the bidder: USD - Standard currency: EUR.* What can I do?
--
The value entered into the *Second chance offer for minimum bids* field is converted into the currency used for the listing before an SCO is submitted to a defeated bidder. If no conversion factor for this currency was entered in the *Setup » Orders » Payment » Currencies* menu, this error message is displayed. Submit an SCO manually afterwards using the *Submit SCO* function. All offers listed in the *Setup » Markets » eBay » Second Chance Offer* menu are displayed with the currency of the auction.

=== Error messages

[.collapseBox]
.I get the error message *OAuth2 account not saved.* What can I do?
--
The plugin <<markets/ebay/ebay-plugins/ebay-OAuth2#, eBay OAuth2>> must be installed and set up in your system. You need this plugin for all calls that use the new eBay APIs. These new APIs are based on the new authentication method OAuth2 instead of the old Auth-n-Auth method. Because the new authentication method is used for more and more essential tasks, you should install the eBay OAuth2 plugin while you set up eBay.

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the eBay error message *Your weekly selling activity limits have been exceeded* or the error *\#10117: New seller without credit card on file*. What can I do?
--
You may receive this message if you have not completely finished the process for registering as an eBay seller. In order to register as a seller with eBay, go to the *eBay website » My eBay » Account » Personal information* and change your *account type*. Afterwards, you have to carry out the following steps:

* Open the *selling* area. +
* Carry out the first two steps for listing an item (your entries are checked in the background). +
* Abort the process at this point. +
From then on, you are registered as a seller and are able to list your items with plentymarkets.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the *Error #240*. What can I do?
--
The item cannot be listed or modified. The item title and/or description may contain inadmissible words or the offer may violate the eBay policy. +
Detail 0: You have reached your sales limit and may currently not list any further items. You can list up to 95 items per month. If one of your offers ends and the item has not been sold, you can list other items. For further information about selling limits and how to raise the limit, refer to the eBay’s link:https://www.ebay.co.uk/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107[Selling limits^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] page. +
You can also call the customer service if you want to increase your selling limit. The quantity for this listing is set to a number higher than *95*. Reduce the quantity to a smaller number, for example *5*, and then restart the listing.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the *Error #83*. What can I do?
--
Invalid duration. The duration "GTC" (in days) is not available for this listing type or it is invalid for the category "20349". The duration of 30 days and "GTC" is only available to commercial sellers who have an eBay shop. +

=== Automatic stock update

[.collapseBox]
.What do I have to consider when changing over to the automatic stock update and before activating this function?
--
This function works with the data entered under *Active listings*. Before activating the automatic function, you have to delete old and unnecessary entries manually. Deleting old entries can potentially be very complex. We recommend using a search filter with duration: *endless (GTC)*, relisted: *no* and stock dependence: *limited (without reservation)*. With these settings, only the listings affected by the automatic stock update are displayed. Additionally, the only listings that are updated are those that have the option *Active* selected for listing on eBay. Remember that you have to clean up the *Active listings* area if you change the length of your offers from having specific durations to being *endless (GTC)*. After changing the duration of listings, new results are shown here.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I accidentally ended all listings which were relisted. These offers were listed again. What can I do?
--
The effect described is caused by the automatic stock update. Deactivate the automatic stock update function.
--

[.collapseBox]
.So far, I have used the plentymarkets endless lister function to keep auctions permanently on eBay. Does the ranking remain the same as well if I keep using this function?
--
The former *Endless lister* function keeps on creating new listings on eBay without relisting. Therefore, the search ranking is lost when using this function.
--

[.collapseBox]
.Does the automatic function also work for auctions with a different duration?
--
No, it only works for listings with the duration *endless (GTC)*.
--

[.collapseBox]
.Do I need to pay for the stock update?
--
No, the stock can be updated as long as the offer is active. There is no relisting for this offer and therefore no charge to be paid. However, if you work with the runtime GTC, then you still need to pay the fees for additional options when eBay automatically prolongs the listing. Insertion fees may only have to be paid again if an expired or ended offer is relisted by the automatic function. For further information about the fees, refer directly to eBay.
--

[.collapseBox]
.How do I exclude an endless lister offer from the automatic stock update?
--
Deactivate the *Endless lister* option.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I list an item variation on eBay without giving a specific size; end customers select the size in the checkout. Can the automatic stock update be used with these offers?
--
The automatic stock update cannot be used with these auctions. Use the eBay format <<Uploading offers with variations, Listings with variations>> instead. The stock information for this offer type is also kept up to date by the automatic stock update.
--

[.collapseBox]
.One of my items was correctly updated by the automatic stock update for a while. However, the offer has not been active on eBay for the last three months because of missing stock. Although I have now booked stock again, the offer is not relisted. What can I do?
--
eBay allows relisting of an item for a maximum of 90 days. In order to have the item listed on the platform again, you have to list it manually one time. After that, the item is covered by the automatic stock update again.
--

[.collapseBox]
.Can I use the listing scheduler for endless listings (GTC)?
--
Do not use the listing scheduler for these offers as your active listings may be duplicated with this function. Apart from that, it is unnecessary to use the listing scheduler as the offers are listed manually once, afterwards this is not necessary any more.

=== Listings with variations

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the error message *eBay error #21916601: Invalid tag value(s) in ClosedNameSpace tag(s) size, colour. The offer cannot be started.* What can I do?
--
In this case, eBay does not allow attributes to have the names *size* and *colour*. If you modify these names slightly, you can avoid this prohibition.
--

[.collapseBox]
.When starting the offer, I receive the error message *eBay error #21916565: Variation listings must include at least one variation. The offer was not listed* - however, the eBay check does not show any errors. What can I do?
--
There is currently no stock for any of your variations. Therefore, the offer cannot be started.
--

[.collapseBox]
.When updating or restarting the offer, I receive the error message *eBay error #21916587: missing name in the variation specifics or variation specifics set.* What can I do?
--
Presumably, one of the item’s variations was removed or altered. In this case, it is necessary to list a completely new offer on eBay.
--

[.collapseBox]
.When updating/relisting, I receive the error message *eBay error #21916635: Invalid multi-SKU item ID supplied with variations.* What can I do?
--
Originally, the offer was started without variations. In the meantime, the settings were configured to include variations in the listing. Updating and restarting is not possible under these circumstances. You have to create and publish a completely new offer.
--

[.collapseBox]
.Can I add new variation values, for example size: XXXL to an existing and active offer?
--
Yes, this is possible. Update the active listing with the help of the group function *Update listings* in the *Active listings* area. If you activated the automatic stock update for endless listings, then this operation is carried out automatically.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I activated the option best offer. However, this setting does not work for my variation listings. What can I do?
--
So far, it is not possible to use the *Best offer* option for variation listings on eBay.
--

[.collapseBox]
.When updating/relisting, I receive the error message *eBay error #21916626: Variation specifics and item specifics entered for a multi-SKU item should be different.* What can I do?
--
For offers including variations, it is not permitted to define the *eBay item properties* (usually *colour* and *size*) with the same name. This is a malfunction on the part of eBay, as the listing should not be listed at all if changes or a relisting causes error messages later on.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the error message EbayReviseItem *eBay error #21916664: The variation specifics entered do not match the variation specifics of the variations of the item.* What can I do?
--
This means that you have changed the existing item variations. You are not allowed to change the names of variations once the active listing has been purchased. You can then only add variations or change the price and stock.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I receive the error message EbayReviseItem *eBay error #21916585: Duplicate custom variation label, or the eBay error #21916586: Duplicate name-value combination in variation specifics.* What can I do?
--
Open the editing window of the item and click on *Edit attribute link* and *Edit variation numbers*. Save the attribute settings here.
--
