== Item export: Filling the column _free_text_field_

The column *free_text_field*, which is included in the plugin format link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/channels/preisportale/elasticexportidealode_4723[IdealoDE^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[], does not have a fixed function and can be used individually by each seller. To do so, have your contact person at idealo allocate the *free_text_field* with a specific type of information.

*Limitation:* This field can only have *one* allocation for idealo. This means that you cannot use the column *free_text_field* as e.g. specific shipping costs for one item and as e.g. item name for another item.
