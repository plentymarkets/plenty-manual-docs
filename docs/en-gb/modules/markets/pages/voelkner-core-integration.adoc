[TIP]
.Which variations are exported to Voelkner?
====
You can use catalogue filters in the menu *Data » Catalogues » [Open catalogue] » Filters* to define which variations should be exported to Voelkner. The filters *Voelkner* and *Active* are already set by default. This means that all variations which are *active* and which have the market availability for Voelkner in the *Availability* tab will be exported to Voelkner. +
You can use the *custom filters* in the catalogue to define in detail which variations should be exported to Voelkner.
====

You can use properties to define in which product category on Voelkner a variation should be listed. For example, you can create the property *Voelkner product categories* of the type selection and use the Voelkner product categories as selection values. You can then use the filters in the catalogue and filter for the property to define into which product category on Voelkner the variations should be exported.

[.instruction]
Creating a property of the type selection:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.
. Click on material:add[] *Create property*. +
→ The settings for the new property are displayed.

. Enter a name for the selection value. +
→ *_Tip:_* You can enter the different Voelkner product categories as names for the selection values.
. Save (material:save[]) the settings. +
→ The selection value is created and displayed in the overview. The value automatically receives a consecutive and unique ID that cannot be changed. You need this ID to only export specific variations in a catalogue.

Next, link the desired variations with the selection property that you created.

[.instruction]
Link variation with property:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Variation properties* area, select the property you created from the *Properties* drop-down list and click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +

[#create-catalogue]
=== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to Voelkner using catalogues. To export your items to Voelkner, create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogues* menu. Afterwards, link the Voelkner data fields with item data saved in plentysystems in the catalogue. +
After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to Voelkner in regular intervals.

*_Note:_* There is a separate catalogue format for each Voelkner product category. Different item data is exported in the different catalogue formats, depending on which information Voelkner requires for each product category. +
This means that you have to create a separate catalogue for each Voelkner product category that you want to sell your items in. Go to *Setup » Markets » Voelkner » Add catalogue templates* to add product categories.

[IMPORTANT]
.Create a catalogue for offers
====
For Voelkner, you always have to create a catalogue for offers. To do so, select the format *Offer* when you create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogues* menu. +
