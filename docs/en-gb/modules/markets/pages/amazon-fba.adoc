:description: Learn how to set up Amazon FBA in plentymarkets. FBA means that Amazon stores and ships your items.
:author: team-plenty-channel

The abbreviation FBA stands for Fulfilment by Amazon. Instead of dealing with the orders yourself, packaging the items and sending them, you let Amazon take care of this task for you with the FBA programme. Of course, you then have to store at least some of your items with Amazon.

== The most important Amazon FBA terms and definitions

Amazon and this manual page use some specific terms in relation to Amazon FBA. These are explained here to help you get started.

[.collapseBox]
.Inbound
--

Inbound means that you supply Amazon with items that Amazon then delivers to your customers.

* Inbound shipments are your shipments to an Amazon FBA Fulfillment Center.
* Inbound orders are the orders that are created in plentymarkets for your inbound shipments.

--

[.collapseBox]
.Outbound
--

Outbound describes the sales and distribution process that Amazon takes over for you:

* Amazon stores the items.
* When a customer places an order, Amazon packs and ships the items.

--

[.collapseBox]
.Amazon Multi-Channel

=== Saving VAT rates for European Fulfilment Network (EFN)

Amazon is continuously expanding its European Fulfilment Network for sellers who use shipment by Amazon. In order to use this network, you need to be fiscally registered in all countries in which you use FBA logistics centres. In order for your invoices to be generated correctly for these new logistics centres from the fiscal point of view, you can - in addition to your company location - select the warehouse location as basis for the default VAT rate. You can carry out these settings for each client in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Accounting* menu. In the *VAT rates* tab, you save the necessary tax rates for the countries.

* xref:orders:accounting.adoc#320[How to set up a new location]
* xref:orders:accounting.adoc#550[How to enter VAT rates]

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Logistics centre is located in Poland and items are shipped to Germany
--
To avoid that the Polish tax rate is used for orders that are shipped to Germany from a logistics centre in Poland, you also have to enter the country Germany with the German tax rate for the location Poland. To do so, go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » Poland » Accounting » Tab: VAT rates* and select the country *Germany*. Enter the German tax rate as well as the valid VAT number. +

=== Creating a warehouse for Amazon FBA

Start by creating warehouses for Amazon fulfilment orders. You need to create a warehouse in plentymarkets for every Amazon logistic warehouse that you send items to. This ensures that the complete range of stock management functions remain intact with the FBA programme and that you can keep track of the stock at Amazon in your plentymarkets system.

[.instruction]
Creating a warehouse:

. Go to *Setup » Stock » Warehouse*.
. Click on *New warehouse*.
. Enter a name for the warehouse.
. Select a *Warehouse type*. +
*_Note:_* If you only want to use this warehouse for FBA stock, i.e. if you only want to offer the stock of this warehouse for Amazon FBA and not in your plentyShop or on other markets, then select the warehouse type *Repair*.
. Select *Amazon* as *Logistics type*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings. +
→ The warehouse is listed in the overview in alphabetical order and opened.
. Carry out further settings according to the explanations on the xref:stock-management:setting-up-a-warehouse.adoc#[Setting up a warehouse] page of the manual.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings. +
→ The warehouse is created.

[TIP]
.Separate Amazon FBA stock display for EU and UK
====
Since Brexit, the FBA UK stock for amazon.co.uk is managed separately and not subsumed under the FBA EU stock. To have the *FBA EU stock* as well as the *FBA UK stock* displayed, at least one account is needed in the system which is linked to a European seller account and which is allowed to retrieve information from a European Amazon platform. An additional account is needed in the system, which is linked to a European seller account and which is allowed to retrieve information from the platform amazon.co.uk. This account then retrieves the total FBA UK stock. For more information, refer to the best practice xref:markets:best-practices-amazon-fba-stock-display.adoc#[Amazon FBA stock display for EU and UK].

[#90]
=== Setting up FBA Inbound shipments

To allow Amazon to ship your items, you need to make sure that there is sufficient stock in one or more FBA fulfilment centers. Start with general settings for shipments to FBA fulfilment centers.

2+^| Shipment by Amazon (FBA)

| *Active*
| Place a check mark to activate Amazon FBA. Your FBA orders automatically are imported into your plentymarkets system daily.

| *Referrers*
| Select whether only orders from Amazon should be processed with FBA or whether orders from other xref:orders:order-referrer.adoc#[referrers] should be processed with FBA as well.

| *Status*
| Select the xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1200[status] that is to be assigned to orders that are imported from Amazon.

| *Warehouse*
| Select which Amazon FBA warehouse should be used for stock synchronisation with the account. This warehouse is also used to assign the FBA order to the account if no FBA order could be assigned to the country the order originates in because no warehouse is set up for the order country.

| *Warehouse for unsellable stock*
| Select which <<#60, Amazon FBA warehouse>> should be used for unsellable stock for this account. If you do not select a warehouse, the unsellable stock will not be imported. +
Unsellable stock is defined as the number of units you have for a SKU in Amazon fulfillment centers in unsellable condition. In Amazon's "Manage FBA Inventory" report, this stock is equivalent to the quantity in the column *afn-unsellable-quantity*.

| *Outgoing items*
| Select whether outgoing items should be marked as booked or not. The option *Mark as booked* does not trigger an item movement. In order to trigger an item movement, select the option *Do not mark as booked* and set up an event procedure.

| *Returns import*
| Select the option *daily* so FBA returns are automatically imported into your plentymarkets system once a day. +
*_Tip:_* In the case of a return, purchasers send the items back to Amazon. The return is imported into your plentymarkets system and listed in the order menu. It is given the return status that you selected in the *Setup » Orders » Settings* menu. +
*_Important:_* Returns will only be imported if the order exists in plentymarkets and its external order number was not changed.

| *Include coupons to returns*
| Select whether coupons can be used for returns or not. If the FBA order was paid fully or partly with a coupon, the coupon is added to the return. A minimum order quantity for the coupon is not taken into consideration.

| Amazon order reports do not specify if any item discounts were granted by the seller or by Amazon. In both cases, the discounted amount is deducted from the order value during the order import. However, if Amazon granted the discount, the order value differs from the amount that Amazon pays you for the order. In such cases, you need to manually adjust the order. Otherwise, you do not pay enough VAT on the order.

== Setting up Amazon Multi-Channel

Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment is a service that enables you to fulfill orders from sales channels other than Amazon.com using the inventory that you have stored in the Amazon fulfillment center (source: Amazon).

In other words, the Multi-Channel function allows you to store your items with Amazon and have Amazon ship your items even though you sell these items on external markets. This chapter describes which settings you have to carry out in your plentymarkets system so that these orders can be processed by Amazon.

The following steps are necessary to configure your stock and item data for Amazon Multi-Channel.

=== Creating a warehouse for Amazon Multi-Channel

Create a warehouse, if you have not yet created one as described in the <<#60, Creating a warehouse for Amazon FBA>> chapter. When using Multi-Channel fulfilment, it is important to set up a warehouse for each country-specific Amazon marketplace with the logistics type *Amazon* and the country as its location.

[IMPORTANT]
.Example of matching Amazon platform and warehouse location
====
Multi-Channel fulfilment takes place via amazon.co.uk. Create a new warehouse Amazon UK with the logistics type *Amazon* and the location Great Britain. The items must actually be stored with Amazon in that country e.g. in Great Britain. Otherwise they cannot be handled and shipped by amazon.co.uk.

=== Synchronising stock for Amazon Multi-Channel

Stock is synchronised with Amazon in the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » FBA stock* menu. There are a few different ways to do this. You can use the hourly automatic stock synchronisation, an automatic procedure or a CSV file.

[IMPORTANT]
.Only for Amazon Multi-Channel
====
This feature is intended for <<Setting up Amazon Multi-Channel, Amazon Multi-Channel>> only.
====

In plentymarkets, a distinction is made between automatic stock synchronisation and manual stock synchronisation. Both procedures are described below.


[tabs]
====
Automatically synchronising stock::
+
--
Proceed as follows to automatically synchronise stock.

[.instruction]
Automatically synchronising stock:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » FBA stock*.
. Select the Amazon account in the *Automatically* tab.
. Click on *Synchronise Amazon FBA stock*.

4 minutes are allotted for this process. If Amazon does not provide the data within this time frame, then stock is not synchronised. The next request will use the previous data that was not transferred. This can lead to errors. Therefore, we recommend that you manually synchronise data with a CSV file as described in the next chapter.

Stock information is only synchronised for those items that had their stock changed on Amazon in the last 30 days. We recommend that you use the manual synchronisation for the first import. The stock is synchronised according to the xref:markets:amazon-setup.adoc#300[initial settings] in plentymarkets.
--

Manually synchronising stock::
+
--
Stock is synchronised manually via CSV file.

[IMPORTANT]
.Assigning SKU numbers
======
If you want to manually synchronise data, then you also have to specify how SKU numbers should be assigned to the stock. This is specified in the xref:markets:amazon-setup.adoc#300[initial settings].
======

Before you carry out this synchronisation, you have to request the corresponding report file from Amazon in Seller Central. Download this CSV file and save it on your computer.

[.instruction]
Manually synchronising stock:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » FBA stock*.
. Click on the *Manual* tab.
. Select the Amazon account.
. Click on *Select file* to select the CSV file that you have just saved.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings to carry out the synchronisation.

=== Processing FBA Inbound orders in the warehouse

FBA Inbound orders are then processed in the warehouse. The order is packed and registered with Amazon in the warehouse. How your warehouse staff processes the order depends on your fulfilment processes. This describes how to print a pick list, access the package content list and register the package with Amazon for an FBA Inbound order.

[#200]
==== Printing a pick list

In the menu *Stock » Amazon FBA Inbound* you can print a xref:orders:pick-list.adoc#[pick list] for the FBA Inbound order.

[.instruction]
Printing a pick list:

. Go to *Stock » Amazon FBA Inbound*.
. *_Optional:_* Choose filters in the left column. Note <<#fba-inbound-orders>>.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The filtered FBA Inbound orders are shown in the right column.
. Click on the order. +
→ The options for editing the order are shown.
. Click on *Print FBA Inbound pick list*. +
→ The pick list is downloaded as PDF file and you can print it.

[#170]
==== Opening the package content list

A xref:orders:package-content-list.adoc#[packet content list] lists the content of pallets, packages and items. The package content list informs Amazon about what items are in the packages that it stores and ships for you.

The package content list prepares the packages based on the settings in the variation. You can change these settings. To do so, go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Settings » Area: Shipping* and change the option in the drop-down list *Packages*.

[TIP]
.Menu *Orders » Package content list*
====
You can also open and work on the package content list in the *Orders » Package content list*. The Register button is only shown when you open the package content list from the Stock » Amazon FBA Inbound menu and closed all packages and pallets. You need the *Register* button to register the finished packages with Amazon.

Once the FBA Inbound order has been packed based on the package content list, you register the order with Amazon. When you register, a package content list is sent to Amazon at the same time. If you use your own shipping service provider, you need the tracking number to register the FBA Inbound order with Amazon.

[IMPORTANT]
.Always pack before registering
====
Once you have registered the order with Amazon, you can no longer change the content of the packages and pallets. As such, only register the order with Amazon once picking and packing is complete.

== Managing FBA Outbound orders

This chapter provides information on processing FBA orders. A quick reminder: Outbound means that Amazon sells and ships for you.

[#22]
=== Workflow of Outbound orders

Outbound orders have the following workflow:

*  Customers order on Amazon.
*  Amazon sends the items.
*  The plentymarkets system requests a report.
*  Amazon creates the report.
*  The next day, plentymarkets automatically checks whether any Amazon reports exist. If yes, then these reports are imported. +
*_Note:_* Amazon only generates the reports once every 4 hours.
*  From the information contained in these reports, orders and contacts are generated in plentymarkets:
 ** Amazon FBA outbound orders are imported with the parameters *Status* and *Referrer*. Select the *Status* that is most appropriate for your process. For example, this could be status *[7] Outgoing items booked*. The referrer is automatically set to Amazon FBA or an Amazon FBA sub-referrer, e.g. Amazon FBA USA. The date when items are shipped is saved directly in plentymarkets. Therefore, stock is not reserved for items that are included in the order.
* 30 days after the order is created in plentymarkets, the contacts are anonymised. The customer data in the contact is anonymized and the link between the order and the contact is deleted. The customer details in the order remain unchanged. +
  ** First name and last name of the contact is anonymized.
  ** The following details are deleted from the contact:
      *** Addresses and address relations
      *** Address options
      *** Order relations
      *** Contact options
      *** Any relation to a company
      *** Bank details

[TIP]
.Event procedures for fulfilment
====
Configure the event procedures that are necessary for the fulfilment process. Such event procedures are having invoices generated and sent to your customers with the help of automatic emails, and having the order then switch to another status. +
For further information, refer to the xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[Event procedures] and xref:fulfilment:fulfilment.adoc#[Fulfilment] pages of the manual.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Note regarding the order import
====
Amazon only generates FBA reports once every 4 hours. Because it can take up to 2 days before an item is ready for shipping, FBA orders are available in your system with a time delay. Generally, the order confirmation that was generated by Amazon is available in your system two days after the item was shipped or a total of up to 4 days after it was ordered. The punctuality of the deliveries, however, is not affected. They will be carried out with the quickness that is customary for Amazon.
====

[#30]
=== FBA Outbound partial deliveries

Amazon will send Amazon FBA partial deliveries if the items ordered by the customer are stored in separate warehouses. Hence, the customer receives multiple packages for one order.
In plentymarkets, each FBA Outbound partial delivery is saved as a separate order, depending on the FBA warehouse which sends the item. You can import one tracking number from Amazon for each partial delivery and then assign it to the according partial delivery. You can generate a separate invoice for each partial delivery. This is necessary if the Amazon warehouses are located in different countries due to differing taxes.
