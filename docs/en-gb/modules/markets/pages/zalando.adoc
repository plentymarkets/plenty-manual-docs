== Frequency of data exchange

Connecting to this market allows for the following automatic functions to take place:

[[data-exchange]]
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Data |Interval

| Item export
| Once a day +
plentymarkets generates an XML file with the item data once daily during the night. This file is called *artikel.xml*. Zalando usually retrieves this XML once per day.

| Stock synchronisation
| Every 15 minutes, asynchronous +
Stock for 1,000 variations is updated per minute. If the API limit set by Zalando is reached, the remaining stock details are sent once the API is unlocked after one minute.

Steps for adding more sales channels::
+
--
You already sell on Zalando and now want to offer your products on another country platform? No problem.

As soon as you signed a contract with Zalando for the additional sales channels, the process continues with the following steps:

. In the plentymarkets forum, request the link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/sammelthema-collective-thread-csv-formular-zum-abgleichen-von-artikeln-silhouetten-csv-form-for-synchronization-of-articles-silhouettes/669460[API route for the new sales channel]. +
*_Important:_* User and password are the same for all Zalando sales channels. As such, Zalando only needs the API route.
. You send the new API route to your Zalando contact with the additional information that all other data is to be sourced from the first sales channel. +
→ Zalando activates the new sales channel.
. Go to *Setup » Orders » Order referrer* and activate the order referrer for the new country.
. Create a new sales price. Remember to correctly save the *currency* and the *country*. Or activate the referrer *Zalando* in an existing sales price for the country. +
*_Important:_* Activate the referrer *Zalando*. The sub-referrers for each Zalando platform (Zalando DE, Zalando NL etc.) will be ignored.
. Prepare the order documents for the country.
. Activate the sales price for the variations. +
*_Important:_* In the variation settings, the sub-referrers for each Zalando platform (Zalando DE, Zalando NL etc.) will be ignored. That is why you do not change the availability settings.
. <<#assistant-2, Complete the assistant to activate the country and to save the settings for prices and stock.>>

[.collapseBox]
.Steps *Prices*
--

For each country that you select in the step *Orders*, a separate step *Prices* is added to the assistant. The settings are the same for all countries:

[[assistant-zalando-prices]]
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Do you want to export prices to Zalando?*
| *Activate price update* = Activate option to export your prices to Zalando every 15 minutes. +

* *Sandbox* = Test data is exported to Zalando.
* *Productive* = Real price data is exported to Zalando.

| *Should warnings by Zalando for price updates be ignored?*
a| During price updates, Zalando checks the plausibility of your prices based on specific criteria. For example, Zalando compares the prices of the same variations on different platforms and compares the regular price with the reduced price. If any significant differences are detected, Zalando triggers a warning. Select if such warnings should be ignored when prices are updated.

* icon:toggle-on[role="green"] = The new prices are published even if Zalando sends a warning.
* icon:toggle-off[role="darkGrey"] (default setting) = Zalando rejects new prices if they do not pass the plausibility checks. +

|*Which sales price should be exported as the reduced price for Zalando?*
|Select the sales price from the drop-down list that you want to export to Zalando as the *Reduced price*. You can select from sales prices of the types *Offer price* or *Default* for which the referrer Zalando, the country and the currency of the country are activated. +
*_Note:_* If you specify a *reduced price* for a variation, the *regular price* is exported to Zalando as the strikethrough price.

| *Use scheduled prices to announce any temporary or permanent price changes to Zalando ahead of time.*
a|
Define up to three scheduled prices. Scheduled prices ensure that Zalando really changes your prices at the specified time. To export scheduled prices to Zalando, you need at least a sales price for the regular price and a property that contains the start date and time for the new price. The start date for scheduled prices must be in the future. You can also select a property for an end date for a scheduled price.

* *Property for start date* = Select the property from the drop-down list that you use to manage the start time for your variations. You can only select properties of the types *Date* or *Text*. +

=== Linking attributes to Zalando

If you have created attributes in your plentymarkets system, you need to link these attributes with Zalando. The following example describes how you can link the attribute “colour” with Zalando. Link further attributes in the same way.

Link at least the following attributes to export your variations to Zalando:

* Größe (size register)

_and/or_

* A colour for the 1st Farbcode (colour code)/Herstellerfarbe (manufacturer colour)

_and/or_

* Länge (length register) for length information (e.g. skirt length)

[#500]
=== Converting silhouettes to characteristics

Zalando groups products into "silhouettes". Zalando also calls these silhouettes "article types". For example, "skirts", "dresses", and "trousers" are all silhouettes. In the *Setup » Markets » Zalando » Settings » Tab: Silhouettes* menu, you convert Zalando silhouettes to item characteristics. Silhouettes are imported into plentymarkets when Zalando is first set up. When Zalando publishes new silhouettes, plentymarkets updates these silhouettes on the following Wednesday. After that, you can convert new silhouettes into characteristics if necessary.

[.instruction]
Converting silhouettes to characteristics:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Zalando » Settings*.
. Click on the *Silhouettes* tab.
. Select the *Groups* for the characteristics that you want to convert. +
*_Note:_* No groups? Either Zalando has not provided the silhouettes or you have not sent the FTP credentials to Zalando (see <<#zalando-csv-form, Requesting the CSV form for matching items/silhouettes>>).
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ Characteristics are created in your plentymarkets system based on the silhouettes.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Tip:_* Exporting a file with Zalando item characteristics
--
Several hundred characteristics are created in plentymarkets when you convert the Zalando silhouettes to characteristics. To make it easier to work with these characteristics, you can export the characteristics to a file. This gives you quick access to the IDs of your Zalando characteristics. This gives you easy access to the IDs of the Zalando characteristics. For example, this will help you to link the characteristics to your items xref:data:best-practices-elasticsync-property-links.adoc#import_property_links[using the import tool].

[.instruction]
Exporting Zalando item characteristics:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Zalando » Settings*.
. Click on the *Silhouettes* tab.
. Click on *Export Zalando item characteristics*. +
→ A file that contains the Zalando characteristics is exported.
. Save the file on your computer.
