For example, Zalando compares the prices of the same variations on different platforms and compares the regular price with the reduced price. If any significant differences are detected, Zalando triggers a warning. Select if such warnings should be ignored when prices are updated.

* icon:toggle-on[role="green"] = The new prices are published even if Zalando sends a warning.

== Converting silhouettes to characteristics

Zalando groups products into "silhouettes". Zalando also calls these silhouettes "article types". For example, "skirts", "dresses", and "trousers" are all silhouettes. In the *Setup » Markets » Zalando » Settings » Tab: Silhouettes* menu, you convert Zalando silhouettes to item characteristics. Silhouettes are imported into plentymarkets when Zalando is first set up. When Zalando publishes new silhouettes, plentymarkets updates these silhouettes on the following Wednesday. After that, you can convert new silhouettes into characteristics if necessary.

[.instruction]
Converting silhouettes to characteristics:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Zalando » Settings*.
. Click on the *Silhouettes* tab.
. Select the *Groups* for the characteristics that you want to convert. +
*_Note:_* No groups? Either Zalando has not provided the silhouettes or you have not sent the FTP credentials to Zalando (see <<#150, After the registration>>).
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ Characteristics are created in your plentymarkets system based on the silhouettes.

[#600]

* Form of address (Geschlecht)
* Größenregister (size list)
* Hersteller-Code (manufacturer code)
* Manufacturer colour

[.collapseBox]
.*_Tip:_* Exporting a file with Zalando item characteristics
--
Several hundred characteristics are created in plentymarkets when you convert the Zalando silhouettes to characteristics. To make it easier to work with these characteristics, you can export the characteristics to a file. This gives you quick access to the IDs of your Zalando characteristics. This gives you easy access to the IDs of the Zalando characteristics. For example, this will help you to link the characteristics to your items xref:data:best-practices-elasticsync-property-links.adoc#import_property_links[using the import tool].

[.instruction]
Exporting Zalando item characteristics:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Zalando » Settings*.
. Click on the *Silhouettes* tab.
. Click on *Export Zalando item characteristics*. +
→ A file that contains the Zalando characteristics is exported.
. Save the file on your computer.
*_Tip:_* <<#zalando-characteristics>> explains the file’s columns. For further information on characteristics, refer to the xref:item:properties.adoc#100[Characteristics and properties] page.
