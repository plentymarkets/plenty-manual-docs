=== Exporting item data

After you set up Kauflux in plentymarkets, you can export your item data. To do so, go to *Data » Elastic export*.

For an automatic item data export, you have to copy the complete URL and save it at Kauflux. The prerequisites for this are that you have carried out at least one export of your item data manually and that you have assigned the individual fields in Kauflux. Additionally, the automatic item data export from Kauflux has to be activated.

=== Exporting variation data

During the export, variation data is exported as additional CSV fields. If you would like to import this CSV or ZIP file into Kauflux, you are asked to map the categories.

[TIP]
.Example
====
The variation fields *colour*, *size* and *length* are displayed in the mapping. For all variation fields, you have to select *GroupParam* as the mapping field so that these fields can be saved as variations on Kauflux.de. The field *GroupID* serves exclusively to identify the items that belong together in a group.
