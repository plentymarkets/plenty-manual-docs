====
You need a valid xref:business-decisions:ssl-certificate.adoc#1200[SSL certificate] for the eBay OAuth2 authentication.
====

OAuth2 is a new authentication method that is needed for more and more essential eBay processes. Therefore, you should already authenticate your eBay accounts for OAuth2 when setting up eBay in plentymarkets.

*_Important:_* Pay attention to correctly copying upper and lower case spelling when you enter the account details. +
→ The account is activated. +
→ The account is shown in the *Setup » Markets » eBay » Accounts » OAuth2* menu.

When activating or updating an account, a token is generated. This token is valid for 18 months. There is no automatic warning when the validity of the token expires. The token also becomes invalid if you change your eBay access data.

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Setting | Explanation

| *UPC from EAN field*
| Select whether to use the Universal Product Code (UPC) from an EAN field or not. +
This setting is defined in the *Transfer as item number* option of a new market listing in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » New listing* menu. If the *Transfer UPC* option is activated in the *Item » Edit item » New listing* menu, select one of the *Use EAN 1 - 4* options here. +
The barcodes from the item settings can be selected for this option.

| *Use variation number as SKU*
a| Should the variation number be used as the stock keeping unit? +

* *No (recommended)* = The listing ID is transferred with the variation ID. The SKU is generated automatically with the following pattern: +
For listings with only one variation: +
Prefix `+#MLID#+` + _Market-listing-ID_ (e.g.: #MLID#123) +
  ** For listings with more than one variation: +
Prefix `+#MLID#+` + _Market-listing-ID_ `+-+` _AttributeValueSetId_ (e.g.: #MLID#123-456) +
*_Tip:_* The AttributeValueSetId is an ID for an exact combination of attributes and attribute values. +
* *Yes* = The variation number is transferred as the SKU. This setting is not recommended because after a variation was changed and the listing was not updated, no synchronisation will take place.

| *Sort eBay variations based on position of item variation*
|Select whether eBay variations should be sorted based on the position of item variations or not. +
If you select *No*, the eBay variations are sorted according to the positions of the attribute values. The position of an attribute value is defined in the *Setup » Item » Attributes » [Open attribute] » Tab: Values* menu.

| *Use eBay image service*
a| Select whether to use the eBay image service. +

* *Yes* = Item images are transferred directly to eBay and are saved there. This may result in additional costs. Multiple item images can be transferred to eBay when this option is selected. +
* *No* = Only the URL of the first item image is transferred.

| *Use image of first variation as gallery image if no gallery image is saved for item*
a| Select whether the image of the first variation should be used as the gallery image if no gallery image is saved for the item. +

* *Yes* = The first image of the first variation is used as the gallery image for eBay. +
* *No* = No gallery image is transferred to eBay. +
* *No* is recommended because eBay recommends a gallery image which shows all of an item’s variations.

| *Add item details from the eBay catalogue*
a| Select whether item details from the eBay catalogue are added. +

* *Yes* = Further item details from the eBay catalogue are automatically added. For further details, refer to the link:https://www.ebay.co.uk/help/selling/listings/creating-managing-listings/listing-item-product-details-catalogue?id=4653[eBay help^]. +
* *No* = Item details are not transferred.

| *Add item images from the eBay catalogue*
a| Select whether item images from the eBay catalogue should be added. +

* *Yes* = Further item images from the eBay catalogue are automatically added. For further details, refer to the link:https://www.ebay.co.uk/help/selling/listings/creating-managing-listings/listing-item-product-details-catalogue?id=4653[eBay help^]. +
* *Yes + Gallery image* = If an item exists in the eBay catalogue, it is added automatically and also used as gallery image. +
* *No* = Item images are not added.

| *Order item*
a| * *Apply order item* = If a customer purchases 5 identical items, then the item is listed once in the order along with a quantity of 5. +
* *One order item per piece* = If a customer purchases 5 identical items, then the item is listed 5 times in the order, each time with a quantity of 1.

| *Place shipping & payment mark*
| Select whether the shipment of an item is reported to eBay when the outgoing items have been booked.

| *Activate automatic stock update*
a|Activate or deactivate the <<Activating the automatic stock update, automatic stock update>> for GTC offers (= listings with a fixed price that are automatically restarted after 30 days) +

* *Yes* = If the *limited (without reservation)* option is selected for the stock dependence of a listing, then the quantity is updated whenever changes of stock occur during the entire duration of the offer. Still, the offer is terminated when the stock is sold out and is re-listed when new stock is available. The eBay ranking remains. Additionally, you can use the *“out of stock” option* for GTC offers so that an item is still displayed on eBay but can no longer be purchased. +
If you have listings with a specific duration, for example 7 days, then you can maintain the ranking by searching in *Active listings* for listings that were ended early, selecting them, clicking on *Group function* and selecting *End and restart* to restart the listings when stock is available again. +
* *No* = There is no automatic stock update.

| *Activate SCO function*
| Submit a <<Setting up Second Chance Offers (SCO), Second Chance Offer>> to a defeated bidder. Defeated bidders then automatically receive an offer of the same item for their highest bids.

| *Stock buffer (SCO function)*
| Enter the number of items that should not be available for SCOs. If the net stock is 5 and 3 was entered as the buffer, then 2 SCOs are submitted if there are that many defeated bidders.

| *Number of days after the submission of an offer in which a potential customer can complete the purchase*
| Select whether the SCO should be ended after *1*, *3*, *5*, or *7 days*.

| Setting | Explanation

| *Retrieve orders*
a| Select the eBay platform used for automatically retrieving sales from all countries or *Do not retrieve sales*. +

* *Retrieve sales from all countries with eBay* = Automatic synchronisation with all active listings. Listings are synchronised hourly. +
Synchronisation is important in certain cases. For example, GTC listings must be synchronised when eBay automatically extends the end time. Furthermore, information such as the delivery address is synchronised. For example, synchronisation is important if the address was changed in the eBay order process. +
* *Do not retrieve sales* = No synchronisation with active listings. If this option is selected, then sales cannot be retrieved manually either.

| *Retrieve eBay returns*

| Select whether an incoming payment is booked for orders of the type *credit note* when an eBay Payments order is successfully refunded.

| *Order status for orders with failed refunds*
| Select a status. If no refund could be issued, then the order is moved to this status. If necessary, create a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#create-status[new status]. +

| *Use "out of stock" option*
a| Select whether the out of stock option should be used. +

* *Yes* = Listings are not ended if the items are unavailable. The offer is displayed but cannot be purchased. The number of items sold is not set to zero when the item is available again. Rather, the sales history remains as it is. In addition to this option, the <<Activating the automatic stock update, automatic stock update>> in the *Initial settings* tab must be activated. Furthermore, this option takes priority over the <<#2500, End offers automatically>> option, i.e. offers are not ended but displayed and cannot be purchased. +
* *No* = Listings are ended automatically if an item is not in stock.

| *Price synchronisation*
a| Select whether you want to update prices automatically. +

* *Hourly (with description)* = Price changes are synchronised automatically every hour. The listing’s description is also updated. Use this option if you use a place holder for prices in the listing’s description. If the listings' price is tied to the item price, the price synchronisation takes place as soon as the item price is changed. If the listings' price is not tied to the item price, the price synchronisation takes place as soon as the price for the market listing is changed. +
* *Hourly (without description)* = Price changes are synchronised automatically every hour. The listing’s description is not updated. If the listings' price is tied to the item price, the price synchronisation takes place as soon as the item price is changed. If the listings' price is not tied to the item price, the price synchronisation takes place as soon as the price for the market listing is changed. +
* *No* = There is no automatic stock update.

| *Price synchronisation for special sales*
a| Select whether you want to use the price synchronisation for special sales. +

* *Yes* = There is a price synchronisation for special sales. If you select *Yes*, special sales on eBay are ended. +

* *No* = No copy of the eBay invoice is sent to the seller.

| *Minimum stock to automatically start a listing*
| Enter a value for the minimum stock that should be used for restarting listings automatically. If the entered value is higher then the current stock, listings are not started automatically. This option is useful, for example when all items of a listing have been sold and then the stock increases due to new incoming items or returns, but you want to restart the listing with a certain stock. +
The entered value for minimum stock doesn’t affect GTC offers for which *Yes* was selected for the *Use "out of stock" option*.

| *Stock buffer*
|Enter a number for the stock buffer. +
The stock is reduced by the value of this number.

| *External eBay order number in order*
a|Select which external eBay order number should be displayed in the order in plentymarkets. +

* *eBay sales record number* (default setting) = The old eBay order number. This number is increased per customer and for each new order at eBay. +
* *eBay order number* = The new eBay order number. This number is assigned individually for each order. eBay introduced the new order number 1 July 2019 and will distribute it stepwise. The new eBay order number replaces the old eBay sales record number. +

| *Variation availability*
| Select a specific *variation availability* or select *ALL* if you would like to use all of the items regardless of their availability. +
Variation availabilities are organised in the *Setup » Item » Availability* menu and set in the *Availability* area of the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Variation ID » Variation tab: Settings* menu of each item.
|===

[TIP]
.Manually retrieving orders
====
Orders are automatically retrieved from eBay when the *Retrieve orders* setting is activated for an account. Additionally, you can retrieve eBay orders manually in the *Setup » Markets » eBay » Data exchange* menu. Select the *date* for the retrieval and click on *Retrieve orders*. +
If the *Do not retrieve sales* option is selected for the *Retrieve orders* setting, orders cannot be retrieved manually either.
====

[#700]
=== Linking shipping profiles

Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Shipping profile links* to link eBay shipping profiles to the plentymarkets shipping profiles. A linked shipping profile is automatically used during the order import if the shipping profile matches the order data, for example account and market settings, of a listing and is activated in the *Global* tab of an item. If the linked shipping profile is deactivated, the active shipping profile with the highest priority is automatically used instead.

Before you can link eBay shipping profiles with the shipping profiles saved in plentymarkets, you have to define business policies and create shipping profiles in the *Setup » Markets » eBay » Business policies* menu.

[#800]
=== Linking return reasons and statuses

Return reasons and return statuses have to be linked if you would like to process <<Processing returns, eBay returns>> in plentymarkets and ensure the automatic data exchange with eBay. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Return settings* in order to link eBay return reasons with the reasons set up in the *Setup » Orders » Order types » Return* menu in plentymarkets. Reasons for return are assigned automatically when returns are imported.

[.instruction]
Linking return reasons:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Return settings*.
. Click on the *Return reason links* tab.
. Click on the tab of the eBay platform for which you would like to link return reasons, for example *Germany*.
. Select a plentymarkets return reason for each *eBay return reason* from the drop-down lists.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.
. Repeat this process for all remaining eBay platforms on which you offer items.

[TIP]
.Simplified return process
====
eBay’s simplified return process is currently available for Germany, USA, the UK, Canada and Australia. Further countries will be available soon.
====

Certain return statuses are used when editing returns in the eBay back end. To import eBay returns into plentymarkets and edit them, link the eBay return statuses to statuses set up in the *Setup » Orders » Status* menu.

[.instruction]
Linking return statuses:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Return settings*.
. Click on the *Return status links* tab.
. Select a plentymarkets return status for each *eBay return status* from the drop-down lists. +
→ You can select an already existing status or you can create a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#create-status[new status] that best suits your workflow.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

For further information about editing eBay returns and using event procedures for partial automation, refer to the <<Processing returns, Processing returns>> chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.New or edited reasons for return
====
Import reasons for return that eBay edited or re-published. To do so, go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Data exchange » Tab: Other* and use the *Synchronise return reasons* function. Newly imported reasons for return can be linked as described above.
====

[#1000]
=== Updating stock

For all listings with the duration *endless* (GTC), automatic stock synchronisation can be activated. The eBay *End* and *Relist* functions are automatically carried out every 15 minutes. The search ranking remains the same. As soon as a listing is relisted by means of the automatic stock update, all settings of this listing are reloaded and the offer is published on eBay with the new options. Stock is updated in plentymarkets and transferred to eBay every 20 minutes. If you want to update other data, for example description or price, the eBay *Update* function must be carried out manually in plentymarkets.

[IMPORTANT]
.Avoiding duplicate listings
====
After booking stock, wait at least one hour before manually starting a listing with the GTC function. This will help you avoid duplicate listings. Furthermore, the *Endless lister* function must be deactivated for listings with the duration *endless (GTC)* in the market listing’s *Base* tab.
====

Go to *Listings » Active listings* and set up the following filters to display all listings using the automatic stock update:

*  Duration: *endless (GTC)*
*  Relisted: *No*
*  Stock dependence: *limited (without reservation)*

All listings displayed when using these filters are affected by the automatic stock update, i.e. all endless listings with limited stock dependence without reservation that have not been relisted, are ended, updated or restarted via the automatic stock update depending on the current net stock.

[#1100]
==== Activating the automatic stock update

The automatic stock update is available for listings with *limited (without reservation)* or *unlimited (with synchronisation)* stock dependence only. If a listing with the *limited (without reservation)* option is started, then the quantity is updated whenever changes of stock occur during the entire duration of the offer. The listing is ended when sold out and restarted as soon as stock is available. The eBay ranking remains the same. Listings with the *unlimited (with synchronisation)* option are not ended and restarted automatically. The ranking of a listing with a certain duration, for example 7 days, remains the same if you search for listings that were ended early and relist them using the *End and restart listing* group function as soon as stock is available.

[.instruction]
Activating the automatic stock update:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Initial settings*.
. Select *Yes* for the *Activate automatic stock update* setting.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

[#1200]
==== Relisting automatically

In order to relist a listing on eBay, the listing must have been active at least once and it must not have ended more than 90 days ago. The automatic stock update detects when new stock for an item is available and activates eBay’s *Relist* function. In doing so, the existing eBay ID is transferred. A new offer is created on eBay and linked to your old offer. A new eBay ID is created in the process. The old eBay ranking is applied, assuming that no data, for example the price, has changed.

When the *Use "out of stock" option* is set in the *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Account settings* menu, the function of the automatic stock update changes. A listing is not ended when an item is out of stock. The item is still displayed but cannot be purchased. The number of items sold is not set to zero when the item is available again. Rather, the number remains in the sales history. Even when the *End offers automatically* setting is active in the *Setup » Listings » Stock* menu, listings are not ended. They cannot be purchased instead. For further information, refer to eBay’s link:https://www.ebay.co.uk/help/selling/listings/creating-managing-listings/relisting-items?id=4147[Relisting your item^] page.

Items can also be created by importing data from eBay. Go to *Data » eBay listings* and carry out the data import. The whole description of the eBay listing is saved as the item or listing description in plentymarkets. All layout elements (HTML tags etc.) of the listing are imported. Therefore, you need to manually edit the listing after the import. If you still wish to immediately start your listings on eBay via plentymarkets, create a layout template containing only the template function *{% GetItemDescription() %}* and nothing else. This way, the existing description is used as the listing description without any additional specifications.

== Uploading offers with variations

You can upload items with multiple variations as a single eBay offer. In order to create variations, you have to create attributes and link them with your items. Variations are xref:item:attributes.adoc#[combinations of different attributes]. Surcharges are applied to every combination, for example size, colour and material. Variations linked with a listing are also transferred to eBay when starting, restarting or updating the listing. For further information, refer to eBay’s link:https://www.ebay.co.uk/help/selling/listings/creating-managing-listings/creating-listings-variations?id=4150[Creating listings with variations^] page.

[IMPORTANT]
.Variations for eBay listings have to match
====
Variations must have the same attributes for eBay listings. It is not allowed to start listings that have variations with different attributes.
====

Mandatory product identification also applies to eBay listings with variations in certain categories. The *manufacturer* and the MPN need to be specified for the entire listing. The *UPC* or *EAN* have to be specified for every variation.

[#6100]
=== Linking attributes with eBay properties

The *eBay attribute link* function allows you to link every plentmarkets attribute with one eBay property. In the attribute link, you can link your plentymarkets attribute values with one eBay attribute value. For example, you can link the *Size* attribute with German and English values.

[IMPORTANT]
.No special characters
====
eBay does not allow special characters for attribute values. eBay will replace special characters by a space or period during the listing export.
====

[.instruction]
Linking attributes with eBay properties:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*.

====
In the *eBay property* drop-down list, only those properties are displayed that eBay did not deactivate for variations. As such, you may find that not as many eBay properties are displayed here as can be selected directly in the listing.
====

[#6200]
=== Linking images with attribute values

You can link your item images with attribute values if you activate the *Image link possible* option for an attribute in the *Setup » Item » Attributes » Tab: Basic settings* menu. Note that images can currently only be linked to one attribute.

[TIP]
.Number of images per attribute
====
250 variations can be transferred per offer. You can only create a maximum of 5 attributes with a maximum of 60 values per attribute. For each attribute value, up to 12 images can be transferred, but not more than 200 images in total. +
Therefore, if you want to create offers with many variations, be sure to calculate the maximum possible number of images per attribute.
====

[.instruction]
Linking images with attribute values:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open an item.
. Click on the *Images* tab.
. Select the appropriate attribute value from the *Variation link* drop-down list.

For further information about mandatory fields of individual categories, refer to link:https://www.ebay.co.uk/help/listings/creating-managing-listings/creating-managing-listings?id=4105[eBay^]. All mandatory fields must be set up or filled in.

[IMPORTANT]
.Exception
====
All of the values that were already taken care of with the variation link must not be set here again.

If you already set a value that should be linked to the attribute *size* for the corresponding listing, then you may not save another value for this attribute here.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Check the settings
====
In particular, be sure to check the settings for eBay properties. It is very important that you check the settings, because the listing cannot be started or updated if the settings are incorrect.

Click on the *eBay properties* link in the listing's basic settings. Check to make sure that the attribute names, which were used for the item variations, for example size or colour, do not have values entered for them. If there are values entered in these text fields, delete them.

[#using-properties]
=== Activating properties for eBay

You want to enhance your eBay listings with further information which cannot be added via eBay properties? Then use plentymarkets properties to describe your listings in more detail.

[.instruction]
Activating a property:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.
. Click on the property that you want to activate for eBay.

====
If you want to use properties in a layout template, then you have to add the following template functions to the layout template: *GetItemPropertyV2ById()*, *GetItemPropertyV2ByName()*, and *PropertyListV2()*. +
Further information about creating layout templates is available in the chapter <<#2800, Managing layout templates>>.
====

[.collapseBox]
.eBay properties, plentymarkets properties, and characteristics?
--
For eBay, you have three different possibilities to add information to your listings: via eBay properties, plentymarkets properties, or characteristics. All three possibilities fulfil the same function: They allow to enhance your listings with further, more detailed information. +

For example, if you have an eBay property, a plentymarkets property, and a characteristic and all three of them contain the same information, then not all three are exported to eBay. plentymarkets will always check first whether you have an eBay property. If so, then the eBay property is exported. If you also have a property and a characteristic with the same information linked to a listing, then the property and the characteristic will not be transferred. +

Hence, information is prioritised in this order:

1. eBay property
2. plentymarkets property
3. characteristic

If you have an eBay property, a plentymarkets property, and a characteristic with the same information, then only the highest priority will be transferred to eBay.

*What to use - eBay properties, plentymarkets properties, or characteristics?*

If you want to enhance your listing with further information, then you should either use eBay properties or plentymarkets properties. You should not create any more characteristics, as characteristics will not be developed any further and will be replaced by properties in the future.

For example, you can only create plentymarkets properties and use them for your listings. If you want customers to be able to find your listings on eBay via the eBay search filters, then the properties and their values have to have the exact same names as the eBay properties. +

Of course, you can also use properties with other names than the eBay properties. However, note that those properties cannot be found via the eBay search filters.
--

[#6500]
=== Linking your own characteristics

In order to be able to use your own characteristics for the eBay market, the characteristics have to be linked with eBay in the *Setup » Item » Characteristics* menu.

[.instruction]
Linking your own characteristics:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Expand the characteristic (icon:plus-square-o[]).
. Activate the *Display as eBay property* setting.
. Save (terra:save[]) the setting. +
→ The characteristic is included in the item's list of properties on eBay.

[TIP]
.Wildcard character in layout template (eBay)
====
If the *Wildcard character in layout template (eBay)* function is activated, the characteristic is also displayed in the layout template of a listing, provided that the wildcard character is used.
====

[#6525]
== Using cross-selling

Use cross-selling to offer further products related to an item. These products are displayed at your listing on eBay. +

Use the template function *GetCrossSellingData* in the *Setup » Listings » Layout* menu to add xref:item:managing-items.adoc#970[cross-selling items] that are linked to an item to a <<Managing layout templates, layout template>> and <<Linking a layout template, link>> this layout template to the desired listings.
The template function *GetCrossSellingData* displays the following data which can be displayed at a cross-selling item:

 * *Item ID* of the item in plentymarkets
 * *Title* of the active listing
 * *External listing ID*
 * *Listing type ID*
 * *Variation ID*
    - for individual listings, the ID of the listed variation is displayed
    - for variation listings, the ID of the main variation is displayed

    - for individual listings, the variation number of the listed variation is displayed
    - for variation listings, the variation number of the main variation is displayed
 * *Price*
    - for individual listings, the price of the listed variation is displayed
    - for variation listings, the price of the listed variation with the lowest price is displayed
 - *Currency*
 * *Image URL*
    - Priority for individual listings: +
        1. Image with the lowest position which is linked to the listed variation +
        2. Image with the lowest position which is not linked to any variation
      - Priority for variation listings: +
        1. Image with the lowest position which is not linked to any variation +
        2. Image with the lowest position which is linked to one of the variations
 * *eBay-URL*
 * *Account ID*

Requirements for adding cross-selling items to an item with the template function *GetCrossSellingData*:

- The cross-selling item has to be linked to the item to which it should be added. This is done in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Item tab: Cross-Selling* menu.
- The item which cross-selling items should be added to must have an active listing.

A code example for a potential layout template which uses the template function *GetCrossSellingData* is displayed below. The image shows the preview of a listing that uses this layout template.

=== Automatically sending dunning letters

You need to set up an automatic procedure in the xref:automation:procedure-manager.adoc#[procedure manager] in order to automatically send dunning information. You can enter the conditions under which the procedures are carried out and define a time for them.

The eBay dispute process can be started with plentymarkets. The customer receives a request for payment via eBay. The dispute process is intended for orders for which payment has been pending for more than 4 days. In plentymarkets, these orders are referred to as *outstanding orders*. These orders are displayed in the *Setup » Markets » eBay » Data exchange* menu and can be retrieved there.

[.instruction]
Automatically sending a dunning letter:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Procedures*.
. Open the *New procedure* tab.
. Carry out the desired settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#automatic-dunning-procedures>>.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

== Processing returns

Different ways of processing incoming return requests from eBay customers are available in plentymarkets:

*  Accept a return request and reclaim the items.
*  Accept a return request and do not reclaim the items, for example low price items.
*  Offer your customer a partial refund of the purchase price.
*  Reject a return request if your eBay terms of return allow it.

[#7500]
=== Importing returns

eBay returns and return statuses of the last 14 days are automatically imported from eBay to plentymarkets and updated every hour. When importing, new returns are created with the *Standard status for returns* in the *Orders » Edit orders* menu. The reason for return chosen by the customer on eBay is assigned to a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#410[reason for return] in plentymarkets. Imported eBay returns are edited the same way as other xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#400[returns] in plentymarkets.

[#7600]
=== Editing returns

The return process depends on whether the customer paid with PayPal or another payment method. If PayPal was used to pay for the item, then initiate a (partial) refund which eBay will carry out for you. The refund amount is automatically booked from your PayPal account to the customer’s PayPal account. Due to the eBay Money Back Guarantee, eBay sets a return directly to the status *Ended* as soon as you have accepted the return if the item was paid for with PayPal. With other payment methods, you initiate refunds yourself and inform eBay about accepting the refund. The customer has to confirm the receipt of the refund. In both cases, you use event procedures to automatically inform eBay about the progress of the return process.

[#7700]
=== Automating returns

Set up xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedures] to automatically exchange information with eBay. With event procedures, you initiate refunds from PayPal payments, mark returns as received and inform eBay that you have paid the refund. Event procedures are triggered when you change a return’s status in the *Orders » Edit orders » [Open return]* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Editing returns in the order type "return" or "credit note"
====
Before you set up event procedures for refunds, decide whether refunds should be edited in the order type *Return* or whether credit notes should be created. If you create credit notes, then select the filter *Order type > Credit notes* for event procedures with refunds. Because edited eBay statuses are imported along with both the credit note and the return, the event procedure would otherwise be triggered twice, i.e. for the return and for the credit note.

You can also set up this event procedure if you use eBay's Managed Payments service. In this case, the refund will be sent directly to eBay. eBay Managed Payments enables users to pay directly at eBay without having to enter a third-party page. eBay takes care of the entire payment and return process. Depending on whether you use eBay Managed Payments or not, you have to set different filters in this event procedure. If you use eBay Managed Payments, select the filter *Order > Payment Method: eBay Payments*.

The event procedure can be triggered in three different cases if you use eBay Managed Payments:

1. A case was opened at eBay. +
→ A refund for this case is sent to eBay.

2. No case was opened at eBay. +
→ Is there a return? If a return exists, a refund for this return is sent to eBay. You can also send a refund to eBay if the return was not imported into plentymarkets.

3. No case was opened at eBay and there is no return. +
→ A refund is sent to eBay.

=== Examples of return processes

The following section illustrates the return process. It describes returns when items are sent back, when items are not sent back and also returns with a partial refund. You have to create *order statuses for eBay returns* and link them with the eBay return statuses in order for the described processes to work. Additionally, you have to set up the event procedures described above.

[TIP]
.eBay returns can also be processed on eBay
====
Instead of partially automating the processes with plentymarkets as described here, you can choose to process eBay returns directly in your eBay account. The return status is automatically updated every hour in plentymarkets.

[#8600]
==== Full refund with return of the item

This section describes a possible scenario where the customer returns the item and receives a full refund. The following information gives an example of a return with your own label. If you work with eBay return labels, select the status *eBay: Accept return, with eBay label* and the event procedure *Accept return, with eBay label*.

.  The buyer requests a return in his or her “My eBay” account.
.  The return request is imported into plentymarkets and saved with the standard status for returns.
.  The seller checks the reason for return under *Orders » Edit orders » [Open return] » Tab: Stock units » Note*.
.  The seller accepts the return and sets the return to the status *eBay: Accept return*. +
→ The event procedure *Accept return* is triggered and your decision is transferred to eBay.
.  The seller generates the return label in the *Orders » Shipping-Center* menu.
.  The seller sets the return to the status *eBay: Upload own label*. +
→ The event procedure *Upload own label on eBay* is triggered.
.  The buyer sends the item back and marks it as sent in his or her “My eBay” account. +
→ The return changes to the status *eBay: purchaser sent return*.
.  The seller receives the item.
.  The seller checks the item and sets the status in the *Orders » Edit orders » [Open return]* menu to *eBay: Mark return as received*. +
→ The event procedure *Mark eBay return as received* is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay.
.  The rest of the refund process depends on which payment method was used by the buyer:
.  PayPal payment:
*  The seller sets the return status to *Initiate eBay refund*. +
→ The event procedure *Initiate eBay refund* is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay. +
→ The refund amount is directly booked from the seller’s PayPal account to the buyer’s PayPal account. +
→ The return changes to the status *eBay: return closed*. The buyer does not have to confirm the receipt of the refund in order for the status to change.

.  A different payment method:
*  The seller carries out the refund.
*  The seller sets the return status to *eBay: Mark refund as sent (non-PayPal)*. +
→ The event procedure *Mark refund as sent (non-PayPal)* is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay.
*  The buyer confirms the receipt of the refund in his or her “My eBay” account. +
→ The return changes to the status *eBay: Return closed*.

[#8700]
==== Full refund without return of the item

This section describes a possible scenario where the customer keeps the item but still receives a full refund. This could be useful if customers want to return low-value items and the amount of work and return expenses are disproportionate to the value of the items.

.  The buyer requests a return in his or her “My eBay” account.
.  The return request is imported into plentymarkets and saved with the standard status for returns.
.  The seller checks the reason for return under *Orders » Edit orders » [Open return] » Tab: Stock units » Note*.

→ The event procedure *Initiate eBay refund* is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay. +
→ The refund amount is directly booked from the seller’s PayPal account to the buyer’s PayPal account. +
→ The return changes to the status *eBay: return closed*. The buyer does not have to confirm the receipt of the refund in order for the status to change.
.  A different payment method:
*  The seller carries out the refund.
*  The seller sets the return status to *eBay: Mark refund as sent (non-PayPal)*. +
→ The event procedure *Mark refund as sent (non-PayPal)* is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay.
*  The buyer confirms the receipt of the refund in his or her “My eBay” account. +
→ The return changes to the status *eBay: Return closed*.

[#8800]
==== Partial refund

This section describes a possible scenario where the customer receives a partial refund. A partial refund could be useful, e.g. if the buyer initiates a return for an item that has small blemishes or missing accessories.

.  The buyer requests a return in his or her “My eBay” account.
.  The return request is imported into plentymarkets and saved with the standard status for returns.
.  The seller checks the reason for return under *Orders » Edit orders » [Open return] » Tab: Stock units » Note*.
.  The seller offers a new price to the customer. The seller enters a suggestion for the new item price under *Orders » Edit orders » [Open return] » Tab: Edit* next to the option *Price [gross]*. +
*_Or:_* Alternatively, the seller enters the new price into the *Credit note*.
Afterwards, the seller sets the return status to *eBay: Offer partial refund*. +
→ The event procedure *Offer partial refund* is triggered and your decision is transferred to eBay.
.  The buyer accepts the partial payment in his or her “My eBay” account. +
→ The return changes to the status *eBay: Partial refund accepted*.
.  The partial refund process depends on which payment method was used by the buyer:
.  PayPal payment:
→ The refund amount is directly booked from the seller’s PayPal account to the buyer’s PayPal account. +
→ The return changes to the status *eBay: return closed*. The buyer does not have to confirm the receipt of the refund in order for the status to change.

.  A different payment method:
*  The seller carries out the partial refund.
*  The seller sets the return status to *eBay: Mark refund as sent (non-PayPal)*. +
→ The event procedure *Mark refund as sent (non-PayPal)* is triggered and the new status is transferred to eBay.
*  The buyer confirms the receipt of the refund in his or her “My eBay” account. +
→ The return changes to the status *eBay: Return closed*.

== Manging purchase cancellations

On eBay, purchases can be cancelled by either the customer or the seller. plentymarkets allows you to mostly automate purchase cancellations.

The information in this chapter is structured as follows:

* <<#900, Setting and linking purchase cancellation statuses>>
* <<#8900-1, Managing purchase cancellations by customers>>
* <<#9950, Managing purchase cancellations by the seller>>

[#900]
=== Setting and linking purchase cancellation statuses

Basic process:

* Create the order statuses (<<#900-1, How?)>>
* Check that the status range for cancelled orders and adjust the range if necessary. (<<#900-2, How?)>>
* Link the purchase cancellation status with the eBay status. (<<#900-3, How?)>>

[#900-1]
[discrete]
===== Setting the order statuses

Purchase cancellation statuses are used to process purchase cancellations in the eBay back end. You can either use existing order statuses or xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1200[create new order statuses]. To import and manage eBay purchase cancellation requests in plentymarkets, you need the following order statuses:

* Purchase cancellation requested
* eBay purchase cancellation accepted
* eBay purchase cancellation rejected
* eBay purchase cancellation closed

The numbers of these statuses depends on the status range you use for cancellations. If you use the default status *[8] Cancelled* for cancellations, you should assign numbers in the range [8.xx].

[.collapseBox]
.Tip: How to create order statuses
--
. Go to Setup » Orders » Events.
. Click on *Create new contact* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Enter a status number. +

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Settings*.
. Navigate to the setting *Status of cancelled orders (No reservation of stocks)*.
. Check of the status range covers the statuses that you set for managing eBay purchase cancellations. +
*_Tip:_* The default is a status range of *[8] Cancelled* to *[8.1] Cancelled by customer*.
. If the status range does not cover the statuses for purchase cancellations, select the highest status that you set for purchase cancellations from the drop-down list *to*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

[#900-3]
[discrete]
===== Linking purchase cancellation statuses

Now link the order statuses that you specified for eBay purchase cancellations with eBay’s purchase cancellation statuses. When a purchase cancellation request is imported, the correct status is then automatically set in the order.

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Purchase cancellation*.
. In the column *Own status*, select the appropriate plentymarkets status for each *eBay purchase cancellation status*. Note <<#table-ebay-status>>.

As a seller, you have three days to accept or reject the request. If you do not process the request within three days, the request is accepted automatically if the buyer has not paid for the item yet. If the buyer already paid for the item, the purchase cancellation is automatically rejected.

Basic process:

* Automate the import of requests for purchase cancellations. (<<#9000, How?>>)
* Create event procedures to automatically inform eBay of your decisions. (<<#9700, How?>>)
* These event procedure are triggered whenever an order with a purchase cancellation request is moved to the specified status. This means that eBay is automatically informed.

[#9000]
==== Purchase cancellations: Importing requests automatically

==== Processing purchase cancellations: reject requests

There are two ways to reject requests: You can either change the order status or create an event procedure to automatically reject requests for cancelling paid orders.

[.collapseBox]
._Alternative 1:_ Rejecting requests - Changing the order status
--

If you have linked the eBay purchase cancellation statuses with your own statuses <<#900, as described above>>, then purchase cancellation requests are imported with the status that you set for “eBay purchase cancellation requested”. By changing the order status, you can process each request individually.

[.instruction]
Changing the order status to reject requests:

. Go to *Orders » Edit orders*.
. Search for orders with the status for *eBay purchase cancellation requested*
. Select an order.
. Change the order’s status to the status for *eBay purchase cancellation rejected*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings. +

=== Managing purchase cancellations by the seller

As a seller, you can start purchase cancellations on eBay.

Basic process:

* Create order statuses for the reasons allowed by eBay. <<9950-1, How?>>
* Create event procedures for automatically starting purchase cancellations. <<9950-2, How?>>
* To start a purchase cancellation, change the order status. <<9950-3, How?>>

[#9950-1]
[discrete]
===== Setting up order statuses for the different reasons

You need to specify a reason to start purchase cancellations on eBay. As such, set up one order status for each of the following reasons:

* Buyer gave incorrect delivery address
* Buyer wants to cancel the purchase
* Item cannot be delivered as agreed upon

You can either use existing order statuses or xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1200[create new order statuses].

[.collapseBox]
.Tip: How to create order statuses
--
. Go to Setup » Orders » Events.
. Click on *Create new contact* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).

* *ItemListingExternalPriceUpdateController* (price synchronization)
* *ItemListingMarketLister* (future listings, relisted listings)
* *ItemListingPriceHelper* (item price updates)
* *ItemListingSyncInventoryJob* (stock synchronisation)
* *EbayMarkAsReceived* (event procedure: accept return)
* *EbayMarkRefundSent* (event procedure: marking eBay refunds as sent)

[.instruction]
Viewing the API log:

. Go to *Data » API log » Tab: API log*.
. Select a format from the *Process* drop-down list.
. *_Optional:_* Select a date if you only want to see entries for a specific day.
. Select the number of results per page.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]) to display the results.

[TIP]
.Missing API format
====
It is possible that some API formats are missing in the drop-down list. These formats will only be available after activating functions in the settings. The format *ItemListingHelperSyncInventoryJob*, for example, will only be available in the drop-down list once the automatic stock update is activated in the *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Initial settings* menu.
====

[#10100]
== Synchronising data

The *Data exchange* menu is composed of several tabs. The *Orders* tab allows you to manually import your orders and view orders where the buyer failed to complete the checkout process on eBay. In the *Listing* tab, you synchronise the listings uploaded on eBay but not yet sold with the listings in plentymarkets. In the *Other* tab you can manually start various synchronisation processes.

[#10200]
=== Manually retrieving orders

In the *Orders* tab, you manually retrieve orders. Retrieving orders manually might be necessary if you do not use the automatic retrieval under *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings* or if your token has expired and you now want to import the orders from this time period.

[.instruction]
Retrieving orders manually:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Data exchange*.
. Select the *Orders* tab.
. Select a country from the *Platform* drop-down list.
. Use the *from* and *to* fields to select a time period.
. Click on *Retrieve orders* to import the orders from the selected time period.

[#10300]
=== Importing outstanding orders

Outstanding orders are those orders for which the buyer has not paid yet and thus not yet completed the checkout process on eBay. These orders cannot be found in the *Orders* menu. You can import outstanding orders so that they become available in the *Orders* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Outstanding orders
====
Outstanding orders only occur if the option *Shipping costs for new orders coming from eBay* was set to *Transfer from eBay*. This option is found under *Setup » Listings » Checkout*. It is only possible to import outstanding orders within 30 days.
====

[.instruction]
Importing outstanding orders:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Data exchange*.
. Select the *Orders* tab.
. Select a country from the *Platform* drop-down list.
. Select a *payment method* from the drop-down list. +
→ The imported order is assigned to the selected payment method.
. Use the *Shipping costs* drop-down list to select a service offered by the desired shipping service provider. +
→ The imported order is assigned to the selected shipping costs.
. Activate the *orders* that you want to import. +
→ If you activate several orders that all belong to the same customer, then these orders are combined and imported as one order.
. Click on the *gear-wheel icon* to import the outstanding orders. +
→ The orders are now available in the *Orders* menu.

[TIP]
.Importing and combining orders
====
Several outstanding orders that belong to the same customer are automatically combined into one order if they are manually imported at the same time. Single orders from different customers can also be selected individually and then be imported. Define a time period for outstanding orders under *Setup » Listings » Checkout*. Once this time period has ended, outstanding orders are automatically imported and combined.
====

[#10400]
=== Synchronising listings and orders

Listings are retrieved on an hourly basis. When retrieving listings from eBay, plentymarkets searches for an existing customer account first to avoid double-entries. If no customer account is found, a new customer account is created automatically in plentymarkets.

Then, the listing is assigned to an item. The assignment of listing and item will run smoothly if the listing on eBay was also listed with plentymarkets or if an item was created with the same title as the listing title. Either a new order is created or an existing eBay order is extended. The order is extended if it fulfils the following criteria:

* Same buyer and identical delivery address
* Identical payment method
* The order is in *status 1* or *status 3*; or in *status 5* if the payment method is cash on delivery
* The order is not yet marked as *paid* or *carried out*

[TIP]
.Tip
====
If there are differing item names, then you can access the item data, click on the *Multi-Channel* tab and enter the listing title for the item under *eBay title*.
====

If orders are found that meet the criteria mentioned above, the *shipping costs* are recalculated. There are two calculation types for shipping costs:

* The shipping costs are calculated by plentymarkets the way that you defined in the shipping profiles.
* The shipping costs are paid by eBay.

If no matching item can be found, the item ID *-2* is always assigned instead.

[IMPORTANT]
.Transferring the package number
====
If you want to send the package number to eBay as part of the shipping information, then you can enter this number in the *settings* tab of the corresponding eBay order. This information is automatically sent to eBay.
====

[#10500]
=== Synchronising listings

In the *Listing* tab, you can import GTC offers where the end date changed, e.g. while your token expired.

[.instruction]
Importing listings:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Data exchange*.
. Click on the *Listing* tab.
. Select an account from the drop-down list.
. Select the option *Start time* or *End time*. +
→ The end time was selected in the example.
. Use the *from* and *to* fields to select a time period.
. Click on *Execute* to update the listings.

[TIP]
.Date selection from…​ to…​
====
For example, if you select *End time*, then enter the day when the token expired *+ \+ 30 days* into the *from* field. In the *to* field, enter the day when the token was reactivated *+ 30 days*. This imports all GTC offers that were extended during the inactive time and will therefore end during the selected time period.
====

[#10600]
=== Synchronising special sales

Create a new special sale directly on eBay. Special sales are automatically synchronised with plentymarkets. If the synchronisation is unexpectedly delayed, then you can manually synchronise the special sales here.

[.instruction]
Manually synchronising special sales:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Data exchange*.
. Click on the *Other* tab.
. Select an account from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Start* to import the special sales. +
→ The special sales are synchronised.

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Data exchange*.
. Click on the *Other* tab.
. Select an account from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Start* to import the shipping discounts for combined payments. +
→ Your eBay account information is transferred to plentymarkets.

[TIP]
.Offering a shipping discount for combined payments
====
Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » Business policies » Tab: Shipping conditions* to select the *shipping discounts for combined payments* that were imported from eBay.
====

[#10800]
=== Synchronising the general conditions for shipping profiles

In this menu, you can synchronise the general conditions for <<Creating shipping profiles, shipping profiles>>.

[.instruction]

. Click on the *Other* tab.
. Click on *Start* next to the *Synchronise return reasons* option to import new or edited eBay reasons for return.

[#11000]
=== Importing eBay listings

In this menu, eBay listings can be directly imported into plentymarkets. In doing so, both a set of item master data and a listing is created in plentymarkets. You have to carry out specific settings for the import. This not only includes selecting the *eBay account* and the *warehouse*, but also selecting which items should be imported.

How to import listings that already exist on eBay into plentymarkets is also explained in this video:

.Importing listings into plentymarkets
video::267560178[vimeo]

[TIP]
.Creating items via data import
====
Items can be created by importing data from eBay. Go to *Data » eBay listings* and carry out the data import. The whole description of the eBay listing is saved as the item or listing description in plentymarkets. All layout elements (HTML tags etc.) of the listing are imported. Therefore, you need to manually edit the listing after the import. If you still wish to immediately start your listings on eBay via plentymarkets, create a layout template containing only the template function *{% GetItemDescription() %}* and nothing else. This way, the existing description is used as the listing description without any additional specifications.
====

[.instruction]
Importing eBay listings:

. Go to *Data » eBay listings*.
. Carry out the desired settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#ebay-importing-listings>>.
