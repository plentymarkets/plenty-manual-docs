[#map-data-fields]
=== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. Check the documentation of the sales channel to find out what data the market expects for the individual data fields.

[TIP]
.Using properties
====
Use xref:item:managing-items.adoc#500[properties] to export values for marketplace data fields that have no corresponding field in plentymarkets.

[TIP]
.Datenfelder zur Grundpreisangabe pflegen
====
The two data fields *Gross content quantity for unit price specification* and *Unit of unit price specification* are not marked as mandatory fields, but they have to be maintained and transferred due to the legal requirement to specify the unit price.
A list with valid values is not available for both data fields. We recommend, however, to map the attribute *Gross content quantity for unit price specification* with the plentymarkets data field *Content quantity* and create a property for the attribute *Unit of unit price specification* and save the values at the variations, for example “g” for *gramme*.

=== Transferring marketplace-specific values

The marketplace requires specific values for most of the attributes in order to be able to transfer product data. Currently, these values are, however, not yet saved at the variation. +
*_Example:_* For example, it is not allowed to enter *test* for the attribute *Brand*. You have to transfer the corresponding code in this case - in this example *BRAND_12345678*.
