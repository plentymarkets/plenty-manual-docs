* Own value `0` or `false` or `n` = All variations are new.
* Own value `1` or `true` or `y` = All variations are used.

=== _Optional:_ Activating variations for Fulfillment by bol.com (FBB/LVB)

bol.com orders can be fulfilled in two different ways:

* Fulfilment by Retailer (FBR) = You ship the order yourself.
