|Enter an internal name for the shipping profile. The name is only displayed in your system. It is _not_ visible for customers in the online shop.

| *Flag*
|Select a flag from the drop-down list that is shown in the order overview. The flag indicates which shipping profile is saved at a glance.

| *Priority*
|Select the priority from the drop-down list. The priority determines which shipping profile is displayed first, second, third, etc.

| *Category*
|Select a category from the drop-down list. The category is another way to prioritise shipping profiles in the shopping cart. Category *1* is selected by default. This means that all of the shipping profiles are given the same priority. For further information, refer to the xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1300[Preparing the shipment] page of the manual.

| *Item extra shipping charge*
|Place a check mark to activate the item extra shipping charge that are saved in the item data record. Up to 2 extra shipping charges can be saved for the item's main variation in the *Shipping* area. *Extra shipping charge 1* is added to the shipping costs for the first item. *Extra shipping charge 2* is added to the shipping costs for all additional items. Extra shipping charges are useful for large or bulky items that are particularly expensive to ship. +
For further information, refer to the xref:fulfilment:preparing-the-shipment.adoc#1100[Preparing the shipment] page of the manual.

| *PostIdent*
|PostIdent is the authority verification by the Deutsche Post AG. It serves to verify customers, e.g. in connection with the proof of age for 18+ items. If you want to activate this option, place a check mark. +
*_Note:_* Items with an 18+ age rating have to be linked to a shipping profile that the PostIdent option was activated for.

| *Activate for new items*
|Select the option if you want the shipping profile to automatically be assigned to new items. +
You should select this option for new items for at least one shipping profile. In doing so, new items are always assigned automatically to this shipping profile. An item cannot be shipped if it is not linked to at least one shipping profile. +
*_Note:_* This setting only applies when you manually create items, but _not_ via REST or import.

| *Cash on delivery*
|Select the option. This allows your customers to select the payment method _Cash on delivery_ in your plentyShop. +
*_Important:_* Installing the cash on delivery plugin is required. You can find the plugin in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment/cashondelivery_5255[plentyMarketplace^].

| *Packing station active*
|Select the option. This allows your customers to enter the field *Packing station* in an optimised way in your plentyShop. +
*_Important:_* It is required that the plugins link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/templates/Ceres_4697[plentyShop LTS^] and link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/templates/IO_4696[IO^] are installed.

| *Post office active*
|Select the option. This allows your customers to enter the field *Post office* in an optimised way in your plentyShop. +

| *Agreement upon data transfer*
|If you select the option, your customers will see a checkbox in your plentyShop where they have to place a check mark to agree that their phone number and email address might be transferred to the shipping service provider.

| *Transfer email and telephone number*
|Select whether the email address and the telephone number should be transferred to the shipping service provider or not or whether an alternative value should be transferred. +
If you select the option *Transfer if available, otherwise transfer alternative*, it will be checked whether an email address and a telephone number are available at the delivery address of the order. If this data is _not_ available, the alternative values that you saved in the fields *Alternative email* and *Alternative telephone number* will be transferred. +
*_Note:_* By default, this data is _not_ transferred to the service provider (GDPR conformity).

| *Alternative email*
|This setting is only visible if the option *Transfer alternative* or *Transfer if available, otherwise transfer alternative* was selected in the drop-down list *Transfer email and telephone number*. Enter an alternative email address that should be transferred to the service provider.

| *Alternative telephone number*
|This setting is only visible if the option *Transfer alternative* or *Transfer if available, otherwise transfer alternative* was selected in the drop-down list *Transfer email and telephone number*. Enter an alternative telephone number that should be transferred to the service provider.

| *Extra charge for islands*
|Many shipping service providers charge a higher fee when shipping to island regions. You as seller should not be left with these costs. Therefore, open each shipping profile and define a surcharge that is added when shipping to island regions. Postcodes for island regions are saved in the system. The order is automatically synchronised. If you activated the extra charge for islands, this charge is only calculated if the system recognises this postcode as an island region. +
The island surcharge applies for each item when using the calculation type *Item shipping charge*.

| *Clients (stores)*
|Select one of the options or select the option *ALL* if the shipping profile should apply to all clients (shops). +
This option is only displayed if at least one client (shop) is set up.

| *Order referrer*
|Activate the referrer *myToys*.

| *Blocked payment methods*
|Select all the payment methods that should _not_ be offered for the shipping profile. If you have shipping profiles that should not include a cash on delivery option, make sure to select all of the options that are used in connection with cash on delivery.

| *Blocked customer classes*
|Block one or more customer classes for the shipping profile by placing a check mark.

| *Shipping groups*
|If you want to create groups for your shipping profiles, enter a name for a shipping group here and click on *Add*. Enter this name into every shipping profile that should belong to this group. You end up with various groups which contain different shipping profiles. +
*_Example:_* Shipping group A contains the shipping profiles 1 and 2. Shipping group B contains the shipping profiles 3 and 4. If you want to assign an item to shipping profiles 3 and 4, open the item and select shipping group B from the drop-down list in the item's *Global* tab in the *Shipping profiles* area. +
This function allows you to easily and quickly assign the shipping profile to new items.

[#prepare-variations]
== Activating variations for the market

Continue with preparing your variations.

[#900]
=== Making variations available

:market-availability: myToys
:option-availability: myToys

include::partial$variation-availability.adoc[]

[#link-category-property]
=== Linking variation to market category

After you created the first marketplace format for {market} with the assistant, the property *{market} category group* is created in your plentymarkets system. In addition, a first property value is created for the property. This property value has the same name as the {market} category that you created the catalogue for.

Each time you create a new catalogue for {market}, a new selection value is added to this property. This selection value has the same name as the {market} category.

This property defines in which {market} category the variation should be listed. To do so, link the variation to the appropriate property value of the property.

[.instruction]
Linking a variation to a {market} category:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that you want to sell on {market}.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. Open the *Variation properties* section.
. From the *Properties* drop-down list, select the property *{market} category group*.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is linked to the variation.
. Select the desired category group from the *Value* drop-down list for the *{market} category group* property. +
*_Tip:_* Categories  are only added as a selection value for the property after you have created a catalogue for this {market} category. +
→ The variation is listed in this {market} category.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

=== Deactivating variations on {market}

A variation has already been exported to myToys, but you do not want to offer this variation on myToys any longer? In this case, it is not enough to exclude this variation from the export. Instead, the variation has to be transferred as inactive once. To do so, proceed as follows.

* In the *Availability* tab of the variation, de-select the market availability *myToys*. +
* To deactivate the variation, the property *myToys category group* has to remain saved in the *Properties* tab of the respective variation.
*_Important:_* If you reactivate the availability of such a variation, the variation is only reactivated on {market} during the nightly item export.

[#550]
== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to {market} using catalogue formats. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

To export your item data to {market}, you need to create catalogues. The catalogues have to be created specifically for each category. Depending on the selected category, the required mandatory fields and optional fields vary. Link the {market} data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to myToys in regular intervals.
// TODO: rewrite

[#600]
=== Notes on the {market} item data structure

The structure of {market} item data differs from the structure in plentymarkets. Only the naming is different:

. The *product* on {market} is the same as the *item* in plentymarkets.
. The *item* on {market} is the same as the *variation* in plentymarkets.

=== Mapping catalogue fields

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. This chapter describes how you map data fields and what particularities apply for item exports to {market}. In addition, we provide recommendations for suitable mappings. This information is structured as follows:

* <<#750, Mapping data fields in the catalogue>>
* <<#800, Notes on mapping data fields>>

[#750]
==== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

Now, map the {market} data fields to the item data saved in plentymarkets. Take note of the information regarding specific mappings and recommendations in this chapter.

include::partial$catalogue-mapping.adoc[]

[#800]
==== Notes on mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. <<#catalogue-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for {market}.

Also take note of the following general information:

* Map at least all *mandatory fields*. To only show marketplace data fields that are mandatory, go to the toolbar and click on material:more_vert[]. Activate the toggle button (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) *Only display mandatory fields*. +
→ *_Note:_* An overview of the mandatory fields for each category is available in link:https://cdn02.plentymarkets.com/pmsbpnokwu6a/frontend/myToys/Pflichtwerteliste_MyToys.xlsx[this list^]. Mandatory fields are labelled with *MUST*.

* For some mappings, it makes sense to create xref:item:properties.adoc#500[properties] beforehand. You need to create and save these properties before you can map them in the catalogue. Thus, make sure you have created all necessary properties.

* {market} cannot process HTML tags. As such, HTML tags are removed during the export. This is particularly relevant for the marketplace data fields *Item descriptions* and *Bullet points*.

* Do you need any additional marketplace data fields to map your variation data correctly? Contact {market} to add any missing marketplace data fields.

[[catalogue-mappings]]
.Notes on mapping data fields
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Marketplace data field | Explanation

| *Product name*
| Map the plentymarkets data field *Name 1*, *Name 2* or *Name 3*.

The following rules apply to product names:

* Enter the item name in German.
* There is no character limit for product names. However, do not use too many characters because {market} will automatically cut off products name that are too long. Thus, keep the product name as short as possible.
* You do not need to mention the manufacturer or any own brands in the product name. This information is shown separately above the item name on {market}.
* Colours, sizes, gender information or repetitions are not allowed as part of product names.

| *Brand*
| Map the plentymarkets data field *Item » External manufacturer name*.

| [option-itemtext]*Texts*
| map the plentymarkets data field *Item text » Item text*. +
The item description can be up to 4000 characters long. Longer text is cut off after 4000 characters and `...` is added. +

*_Note:_* Do you use HTML tags to format your item texts? +
{market} cannot process HTML tags. As such, HTML tags are removed during the export. As such, check your item texts. If you use a lot of HTML tags, you might want to create a property in which you save item descriptions without HTML tags.

| *Colour*
| The colour is used to create variations in plentymarkets and on {market}.

You need two marketplace data fields for exporting colours:

[cols="1,2"]
!===
! Marketplace data field ! Mapping recommendation

! *General Attributes > Colour*
! Map an attribute for colours to the marketplace data field *Colour*.

! *Colour > Colour*
! To each {market} colour shade, map an attribute value of the same attribute for colours that you mapped to the marketplace data field *General Attributes > Colour*.
!===

[.collapseBox]
.Do you have different colour shades than {market}, for example “light red”, “dark read” and “cherry red” instead of “red”?
--
If you use colour shades that differ from {market}, you can map fallback data fields.

*_Example:_* In addition to *Red*, you also use the shades *Light red*, *Dark red* and *Cherry red* which you manage either as attribute values or property values.

Map these attribute/property values to the marketplace data field *Red* as fallback data fields.

Customers can then find the variation with all of the three different properties when they filter for the colour *Red* on {market}.
--

| *Size*
| The size usually is used to create variations in plentymarkets and on {market}. As such, map an attribute for size information. +
*_Note:_* Whether or not the size is used to create variations largely depends on your product portfolio. If your variations were created without attributes for sizes, contact the {market} integration team to talk about how you can proceed.

| *RRP*
| Map a sales price of the type *RRP*. The referrer {market} must be activated for this sales price.

RRP are shown on {market} based on the following logic:

* If the sales price is lower than the RRP, the RRP is shown on {market} as a strikethrough price.
* If the sales prices is higher than or equal to the RRP, the RRP will not be displayed on {market}.

*_Note:_* Do you not have any RRP, for example because you are the manufacturer? Then assign the same sales price as for the marketplace data field *Net sales price*. This way, no strikethrough price will be displayed on {market}.

| [option-bulletpoints]*Bullet points*
| Additional information on an item is displayed on the {market} item page by means of bullet points.

The following rules apply for bullet points:

* Up to 255 characters can be exported per bullet point.
* The text is cut off after 355 characters and `...` is added.
* {market} cannot process HTML tags. As such, HTML tags are removed during the export. +
*_Tip:_* Do not use HTML tags in the properties for the bullet points.

*_Recommendation:_* Create a separate property of the type *Text* for each bullet point.

| *Season*
| Map the values of a plentymarkets property to the seasons. +
*_Tip:_* For variations that are not seasonal, save the property value that you mapped to the {market} value *NOOS* in the catalogue.

{market} uses the following abbreviations for seasons:

* NOOS = never out of stock
* FS = Spring/summer
* HW = Autumn/winter

| *Pattern*
| Map the values of a plentymarkets property to each pattern. +
*_Tip:_* For variations that do not have a pattern, save the property value that you mapped to the {market} value *uni* in the catalogue.

| Material composition
| You need to specify the material composition to list products in some categories. This is particularly relevant for textiles and shoes.

Two marketplace data fields are combined to export material composition information:

* *General Components > Textile composition - 1. material composition textile* is used to export the composition in percent.
* *Textile component 1* specifies the part of the variation to which the percentages relate. For example, this could be the lining or the cuffs.

As a minimum, you need to map *1\. material composition textile* and *Textile component 1*. The data fields for materials 2 to 5 are optional.

[cols="1,3a"]
!===
! *General Components >* +

*Textile composition - 1. Material composition textile* +

to +

*Textile composition - 5. Material composition textile*
! These marketplace data fields are used to specify the material composition in percent.

Use a property to specify material compositions in percent:

. Create a property of the type *Text*.
. Links the property with the variation.
. Enter the material composition in the text field of the property. Use the following format:

  * *{"material1": "percentage","material2": "percentage","material3": "percentage"}* +
  *_Important:_* The values for material types you enter must be identical to the
  link:https://cdn02.plentymarkets.com/pmsbpnokwu6a/frontend/myToys/myToys_Materialien_sortiert.pdf[values that {market} uses^].
  * *_Example:_* `{"WO": "90","EL": "10"}`

! *Textile component 1*
! As described above, the marketplace data field *General Components > Textile composition - 1. Material composition textile* is used to specify the material composition of a variation in percent. However, {market} does not know which part of the variation these percentages relate to. As such, the marketplace data field *Textile component 1* specifies to {market} which component of a variation the percentages relate to.

Examples of textile components are Obermaterial (upper), Außenjacke (outer jacket), Beinfutter (leg lining), or Bündchen (cuffs). You can find a complete list of the textile components {market} uses link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plentymarkets/plenty-manual-docs/main/docs/en-gb/modules/markets/examples/mytoys-textilkomponenten.txt[here^].

Use a property to specify the textile components:

. Create a property of the type *Selection*.
. Save all components that you need for your variation as selection values.
. In the catalogue, map the selection values of the property to the different {market} textile components.
. Links the property with the variation.
. Select a suitable property value.

!===

| *Item weight*
| The entered value is transmitted in grams.

| *Age recommendation*
| The age recommendation defines the target group. This information is used to automatically determine the shop in which the variation is published:

* Variations with an age recommendation of *up to 16 years* are published on {market}.
* Variations with an age recommendation of *18 years or higher* are published on mirapodo/yomonda.

The following values can be used:

* *new born* = 0-9 months +
* *baby* = 9-24 months +
* *mini* = 2-8 years +
* *teen* = 8-16 years +
* *adult* = 18-99 years

[.collapseBox]
.Map a property for *Age recommendation* and link it to your variations
--

. Create a property with the following settings:
* Name: Age group
* Section: Item
* Type: Selection
* Selection values:
  ** *new born*
  ** *baby*
  ** *mini*
  ** *teen*
  ** *adult*
. In the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Variation tab: Settings*, link the variation to the property.
. Select the property value that suits the variation.
--

2+^| Fields that are exported without a mapping

| A_TRADESTAT_NR
| This is the Intrastat number. This field cannot be mapped in the catalogue. Instead, the *Customs tariff number* saved for the variation is automatically exported. +
*_Tip:_* To save the customs tariff number, go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Costs » Entry field: Customs tariff number*. +
*_Note:_* If the field *Customs tariff number* is empty, the value `12345678` is exported automatically. myToys interprets this value as “no intrastat number”.

| A_ORG_COUNTRY +
(_mandatory_)
| This is the country of origin (COO) of the variation. This field cannot be mapped in the catalogue. Instead, the country that you selected from the drop-down list *Manufacturing country* of the item is exported automatically. This means that the same country of origin is exported for all variations of an item. +
*_Tip:_* Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » Tab: Global » Area: Basic settings » Drop-down list: Manufacturing country* to save the country of origin.
