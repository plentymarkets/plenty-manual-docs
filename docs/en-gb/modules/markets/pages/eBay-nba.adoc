The eBay NBA (Next Best Action) plugin enables you to compare your active eBay listings to those of your competitors and to recommendations from eBay in order to optimise your listings and to increase your ranking on eBay.

Detect the low performers of your listings in just a few steps and optimise your listings with the help of recommendations directly from eBay.

When you install the eBay NBA plugin, the menu item *eBay NBA* is added to the *Listings* menu. This menu contains an overview of eBay listings that can be optimised, and recommendations from eBay on what to change in your listings to improve them. eBay recommendations for listing improvement are imported into plentymarkets once per month.
