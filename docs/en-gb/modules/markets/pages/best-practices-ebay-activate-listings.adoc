== Setting up the sales price

. Go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices*.
. Create a new sales price.
. Set up the following options:
* [ ] Currency
* [ ] Client
* [ ] Class
* [ ] Country
* [ ] Referrer
* [ ] eBay accounts +
-> The default client must be activated for the sales price.

[IMPORTANT]

If you have saved only one sales price for eBay, this price must not be a RRP or a special offer. The price type RRP can only be selected if you have already saved another price for eBay which is not an RRP.

== Setting up items

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item and open the *Variation ID* tab.
. Set up the following options in the tabs listed below: +
-> *Settings*: Place a check mark next to the option *Active*. +
-> *Settings*: Select a sales price. +
-> *Availability*: In the *Markets* area, save a referrer for eBay.
. If your item has variations, you can activate the inheritance by using the variation group function.

[TIP]
.Variation availability
====
Consider the *Variation availability* option in the *Setup » Markets » eBay » Settings » Tab: Account settings* menu. Only the variation availabilities selected for this option are exported to eBay. To ensure that your variations are always exported to eBay, we recommend to select all variation availabilities. Otherwise it might happen that your variations will not be exported in certain cases, e.g. if their availability changes and they are not in stock any more.
