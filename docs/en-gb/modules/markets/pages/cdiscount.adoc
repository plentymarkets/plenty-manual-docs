[#single-item-variations]
== Distinction of single items and variation items

Only specific product types, such as clothing, can be offered as variation items on Cdiscount. Therefore, all variations will be exported to Cdiscount as single items by default.

Variations can only be listed as variation items on Cdiscount if the following settings were made:

* The variation is linked with <<#600, attributes>> for clothing size or clothing colour.
* The item is linked with a <<#700, characteristic>> of the type *No* that is linked to the Cdiscount characteristic *Variation item*.

If you use the same attribute for single items and variation items on Cdiscount, you can use a characteristic of the type *No* that is linked to the Cdiscount characteristic *No variation item* to list the item as single item.

[discrete]
=== Product names of single items

Attributes are added to the product names of variations which are listed as single items on Cdiscount. The attributes are shown in square brackets behind the product name on Cdiscount. +
For variations which are listed as variation items on Cdiscount, attributes will not be added to the product name.

== Setting up the data exchange

In order for the interface to successfully carry out the item export, the order import and the stock synchronisation, certain settings are mandatory. Pay attention to the following list.

[IMPORTANT]
.Product creation on Cdiscount
====
The product creation serves as a query to add a new product to Cdiscount's product database. As soon as Cdiscount approves and adds your item to its database, you cannot make any further changes to the item data. Therefore, check if you have saved all the necessary data. The check list serves as list for all mandatory settings for the product creation. Further settings can be carried out as desired.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Offer creation on Cdiscount
====
Every created item is saved in a database on Cdiscount. Every item can be identified by at least one EAN. Marking products with EANs enables sellers to create offers for these products. The setup is simpler in comparison to the previous product creation and makes it easy to get started on Cdiscount. +
The offer creation as well as the synchronisation (stock) are controlled by one file. +
The following check list contains all mandatory settings for an item to be transferred in this file.

In the *Archive* tab, download the item catalogue or the stock synchronisation as a ZIP file. Downloading the ZIP files makes it possible for you to transfer the files to your Cdiscount contact person in case there are problems during the import.

[.instruction]
Transferring the stock synchronisation to Cdiscount:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Cdiscount.com » Tab: Archive*.
. Click on *Download stock synchronisation*.
. Save the file on your computer and send it to Cdiscount in an email if needed.

Stock is updated once an hour.

====

[.instruction]
Creating a CSV export:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Cdiscount.com » Tab: Settings*.

[#1200]
== Automatically sending returns

Set up an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedure] to automatically send returns to Cdiscount.

[IMPORTANT]
.Credit notes for returns always for the sum of an order item
====
If a Cdiscount order has more than one order item and the customer returns only a partial amount of this order item, Cdiscount will always refund the total sum of this order item. This is due to a limitation on Cdiscount. +
*_Example:_*
The customer orders two sweaters for 30€ each and a jacket for 50€ and returns one of the sweaters. A credit note for the sum of this order item is created, in this case this would be 60€.
