== Linking ASIN with variations

An ASIN (= Amazon Standard Identification Number) is a unique product identification number on Amazon which simplifies selling items on Amazon. In order to quickly and comfortably sell items that have already been listed on Amazon, an ASIN should be saved for every variation. +

If an ASIN is saved for a variation, then only price, stock, and GTIN need to be saved for the variation to sell the item on Amazon.

[IMPORTANT]
.Save a GTIN for your variations
====
The barcode GTIN13 is required to search for ASINs on Amazon and to import them into plentymarkets. Therefore, make sure that a barcode (GTIN13) is saved for your variations. Otherwise, ASINs cannot be found.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Go through the Amazon ASIN import assistant
====
First, go through the *Amazon ASIN import* assistant in order to import matching ASINs for your variations into your plentymarkets system. This is done in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu. Also use the assistant to define if and how ASINs should be linked to variations.
====

The *Setup » Markets » Amazon » ASIN matching* menu contains an overview of imported ASINs. All imported ASINs are displayed here, including ASINs which are linked with a variation and ASINs which have not yet been linked. You can also link ASINs individually or with the group function in this menu.

ASINs are imported into your plentymarkets system stepwise. Therefore, not all variations that can be linked with variations are displayed immediately.

== Defining prices

In this chapter, you will learn how to define sales prices, RRPs, and special offers for Amazon. In addition, find out how to export the information that Amazon needs to calculate unit prices.

[IMPORTANT]
.Define a sales price without price type
====
Define a sales price with no price type (RRP, special offer, set price). Otherwise, your items will not be exported to Amazon.
====

[#800]
=== Defining a sales price

Proceed as described below to define a sales price for Amazon country platforms. This price is displayed on the country platforms.

====
TIP: If you already use the new catalogues for the export, you can skip the step *Defining the sales price for country platforms*. The assistant *Create catalogues - Amazon* can automatically create a sales price.
====

[.instruction]
Defining the sales price for country platforms:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices » [Open sales price] » Tab: Settings*. +
*_Note:_* Select a sales price with no price type (RRP, special offer, set price). Otherwise, your items will not be exported.
. Activate the Amazon referrer.
. Activate the Amazon account.
. Click on the *Language* tab.
. Enter the desired names into the *Internal name* and *External name* fields. +
*_Note:_* If these fields are empty, the price will not be taken into consideration.

[#850]
=== Defining special offers

In order to transfer special offers to Amazon, create an additional sales price with the price type *Special offer* and link it to the variation. In addition, create the properties *SaleStartDate* and *SaleEndDate* and link these properties to the variation. Proceed as described below to define special offers for Amazon items.

[.instruction]
Defining a special offer for Amazon platforms:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices » [Open sales price] » Tab: Settings*.
. In the row *Price type*, activate the option *Special offer*.
. Activate the Amazon referrer.
. Activate the Amazon account.

. Enter the desired names into the *Internal name* and *External name* fields. +
*_Note:_* If these fields are empty, the price will not be taken into consideration.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

Now create the properties *SaleStartDate* and *SaleEndDate* and map these properties to Amazon categories. Proceed as decribed below to create and map the property *SaleStartDate*. Create the property *SaleEndDate* in the same way but enter the name *SaleEndDate* and link the Amazon field *sale_end_date* instead.

* Is this your first time working with properties? Then read up on the <<item/settings/properties#10, principles of properties first>>.

[.instruction]
Creating and mapping a property for special offers:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.
. Click on *icon:plus[role="darkGrey"] Create property*.
. In the drop-down list *Section*, select the option *Items*.
. From the drop-down list *Type*, select the option *Date*.
. In the field *Name*, enter the name *SaleStartDate*. +
*_Important:_* Only use this name *SaleStartDate* for the property. Otherwise, the special offer price will not be exported to Amazon.
. Enter a position number for the property.
. *_Optional:_* If you sell internationally, save the name *SaleStartDate* for additional languages.
. In the *Amazon* area, click on *icon:plus-square[role="green"] Add link*.
. Select an *Amazon platform* from the drop-down list.
. Select a *category* from the drop-down list.
. In the drop-down list *Field*, select the field *sale_from_date*.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ The correlation is saved.
. Now create the property *SaleEndDate* in the same way. In the drop-down list *Field*, select *sales_end_date*.

You have already created a special offer price and the properties *SalesStartDate* and *SalesEndDate*. Now specify the period in which the offer price is valid. You also save a price.

[.instruction]

. In the *Sales price* area, add the offer price (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Enter a price.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Variation properties*, enter the property name *SalesStartDate*.
*_Note:_* Can’t find the property? Check that you mapped it to the correct Amazon category.
. Click on *Add*. +
→ The property is added.
. Click into the column *Value*. +
→ The calendar opens.
. Select a start date for the offer price.
. In the *Variation properties*, enter the property name *SalesEndDate*.
. Click on *Add*. +
→ The property is added.
. Click into the column *Value*. +
→ The calendar opens.
. Select an end date for the offer price. +
*_Tip:_* The end date must be later than the start date.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#country-of-origin]
== Saving the manufacturing country

You need to specify the manufacturing country (country of origin, COO) for all products. Save one manufacturing country for all variations of an item. If the variations of an item are manufactured in different countries, you can use properties instead.

IMPORTANT: If you link a property to the Amazon field **country_of_origin** and link this property to the variation, this property takes priority over the setting **Manufacturing country** of the item.

[.instruction]
Saving one manufacturing country for all variations of an item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Global* tab. +
→ Scroll to the area *Basic settings*.
. From the drop-down list, select the manufacturing country.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ The manufacturing country is exported for all variations of the item. +
→ The name of the country is automatically translated into the language of each Amazon platform. +
*_Tip:_* To process several items at once, use <<item/import-export-create/create/mass-processing#, mass processing>>.

[.instruction]
Saving a manufacturing country for one variation of an item:

. Create a property of the type *Text*.
. Link the property to the Amazon field *country_of_origin*. +
*_Tip:_* You need link each combination of an Amazon platform and an Amazon category separately.
. Links the property with the variation. +
. Save the name of the manufacturing country in all necessary languages as the property value.
→ The property value saved for the variation is exported. +
*_Note:_* For the parent entry, the property value of the variation with the lowest ID is used. As such, you cannot save a value for **country_of_origin** for the parent value. +
*_Tip:_* If you don’t have a lot of manufacturing countries, you can use a property of the type *Selection* instead of a property of the type *Text*. You can then save the country names for all languages in the property. This also reduces the risk of typos.

== Setting up freely definable fields in the Amazon export (Seller Central)

The freely definable fields are used to customise the data that you export to Amazon. Those fields have to be linked to <<item/settings/free-text-fields#, free text fields>>. The free text fields allow you to individually customise the item data and therefore save an exact description of the item.

[#1000]
=== Creating free text fields

First, create the <<item/settings/free-text-fields#, free text fields>> that you want to link to freely definable fields on Amazon. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Creating free text fields:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Free text fields*.
. Enter a name under *Field name*.
. Select the *data type* from the drop-down list.
. Enter the maximum number of *characters* for the free text field.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ The free text fields will be available the next day in the editing window of the items in the *Fields* tab. Enter the actual text there.

[#1100]
=== Linking free text fields

Once you have configured the free text fields, link them with Amazon Seller Central export fields. To do so, proceed as follows.

[.instruction]
Linking free text fields with Amazon export fields:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Freely definable fields*.
. Open the submenu *Freely definable fields in the Amazon export (Seller Central)* (icon:plus-square-o[]).
. Expand the category (icon:plus-square-o[]).
. Select an *Export field* from the drop-down list.
. Select the appropriate field from the *Free text field* drop-down list. +
→ You can only select fields that you have created.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#1200]
== Setting up freely definable fields in the Amazon export (Marketplace)

Link freely definable fields in the Amazon export (Marketplace) for the BMVD categories Books, Music, Video and DVD.

[.instruction]
Linking free text fields:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Freely definable fields*.
. Open the submenu *Freely definable fields in the Amazon export (Marketplace)*.
. Select the free text fields from the drop-down lists.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.
. Go to *Setup » Item » Free text fields*.
. Enter a name under *Field name* for the free text fields that you have just selected.
. Select a type from the drop-down list in the *Data type* column.
. Enter the maximum number of *characters* for the free text field.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ The free text fields will be available the next day in the editing window of the items in the *Fields* tab. Then, enter the *number*. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#options-item-condition>> and <<#options-will-ship-internationally>>.

[TIP]
.Limitations for free text fields
====
Only certain values can be used for the fields *item-condition* and *will-ship-internationally*. The field *item-note* can be used as a text field and formulated differently for every item.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Entering the Amazon product type and item data
====
Open an item under *Item » Edit item* and click on the *Multi-Channel* tab. The *Amazon product type* must be selected in order for the export to work correctly: *Marketplace - Books*, *Marketplace - Music*, *Marketplace - Video*, *Marketplace - DVD*.

[#1300]
== Linking categories

include::_textblocks/instructions/amz-link-categories.adoc[]

[#1350]
== Linking attributes and attribute values

<<item/managing-items#390, Attributes>> also have to be linked before your items can be transferred to Amazon. It is also possible to link attributes for several languages.

[.instruction]
Linking attributes and attribute values:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*. +
→ The overview of all attributes used in your catalogue opens.
. Open an attribute.
. Click on the *Attribute link* tab.
. Click on *Amazon*.  +
→ The Amazon area for the attribute link is displayed.
. Select the corresponding Amazon category from the drop-down list.
. Enter the Amazon attribute values that most closely match your own attribute values. +
*_Note:_* At the moment, the second column for *Market attribute values* is only used for the category *Size* in the *Shoes* flat file. The column *footwear_size* is filled with the value entered in the second column when the *Shoes* flat file is exported. If the second column is empty, *footwear_size* is filled with the value entered in the first column.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.
. Repeat this process for all remaining attributes.

[IMPORTANT]
.Deactivate main variation without an attribute link
====
If an item's variations have attribute links but the main variation has none, then the main variation has to be set to inactive. Otherwise, the main variation will be exported as a single item. The main variation must be activated if it has an attribute link.
====

[#1390]
== Linking properties with Amazon

Use <<item/settings/properties#500, properties>> to define individual features of a variation. For example, you can use properties to highlight a variation’s technical features, such as Bluetooth or WLAN.

====
TIP: If you already use the new catalogues for the export, you can skip the step *Linking properties with Amazon*. The assistant *Create catalogues - Amazon* can automatically create properties.
====

Link properties that you have created in the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration* and added to a variation with Amazon in the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration » [Open the property] » Tab: Amazon* menu.

[.instruction]
Linking a property with Amazon:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.

. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ The property is linked with the Amazon field and exported during the next item export.

[#1395]
=== Linking properties with Amazon via import

Properties can also be linked with Amazon via import.
 However, this is only possible when importing new data.

[.instruction]
Linking properties with Amazon via import:

. Go to *Data » Import*.
. Click on *Add import* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. Create a new import of the type Property.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.
. In the *Matching* tab, enter the value for the Property ID.
. For the import options, either select *Import new data, update existing* or *Only import new data*.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.
. In the *Mapping* tab, map the category, the field and the platform.
. Select *Own value* as source.
. Enter the respective value for the category, the field or the platform.
. Assign the respective plentymarkets data field as target.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
. Click on *Run import* (icon:play-circle[role="grey"]) to import the properties. +
→ The linked properties will be visible under *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.

[IMPORTANT]
.One mapping per platform
====
In case your values are in a CSV file, you can link several platforms at once. However, if you use the own value, you need to create one mapping per link to a platform.
====

[#1400]
== Linking characteristics with Amazon

In case you ever need to define the parameters or characteristics of items for Amazon which cannot directly be set up with plentymarkets, we have developed the solution that is described here: Parameters or values are integrated by means of the characteristics.

====
TIP: Characteristics are an old feature. We recommend that you do not create new characteristics. Use the <<#1390, properties>> instead.
====



The item’s characteristic and the Amazon product type are linked in the *Setup » Item » Characteristics* menu. In plentymarkets, you can save a maximum of 16 links for one characteristic.

[IMPORTANT]
.Properties are prioritised over characteristics
====
If you linked a characteristic and a property with the same Amazon field, then the property is prioritised over the characteristic. The characteristic is overwritten by the property during the item export.
====

[.instruction]
Linking characteristics with the Amazon product type:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Expand (icon:plus-square-o[]) the characteristic that you want to use for Amazon. +
→ The characteristic's editing area opens.
. Select the category from the *Amazon link* drop-down list. +
→ A drop-down list is shown.
. Select the Amazon field from the drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The link is created.

[TIP]
.Tip: Characteristic type “selection”
====
All characteristic types can be used for the Amazon link. Characteristics of the types *Selection* and *Text* can be used to transfer multilingual characteristics.
====

[discrete]
===== Activating a characteristic for an item

In the last step, activate the <<item/managing-items#80, characteristic>> in the item settings and enter a value.

[.instruction]
Activating a characteristic for an item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Click on the *Characteristics* tab.
. Activate the characteristic.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
→ The field for entering the value is created.
. Enter a value.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.EU compliance export
====
EU compliance notes are added by means of a characteristic. They are transferred to Amazon as a separate flatfile. To transfer EU compliance notes, select the *EU Compliance* Amazon field for the corresponding Amazon product type, then link the characteristic to the item and select the appropriate export category from the *Item settings* tab in the Amazon settings.
