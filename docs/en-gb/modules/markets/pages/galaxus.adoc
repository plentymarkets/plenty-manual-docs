== Orders if you are based in Germany

Your company is based in Germany and you deliver to Galaxus end customers in Switzerland.
As such, three scenarios are possible:

. You send the order directly to the address of the end customer in Switzerland.
. You use the Galaxus EU hub and _do not_ have fiscal representation in Switzerland.
. You use Galaxus EU hub and have fiscal representation in Switzerland.

[.collapseBox]
.What is the EU Hub?
--
The EU Hub is a cross border customs clearance solution offered by Galaxus. It provides easy access to the Swiss market.
As a EU merchant, you can use the EU Hub both with and without fiscal representation.
The Digitec Galaxus AG acts as a service provider to handle logistics to Switzerland including declaration, customs clearance and VAT payment.

.What is fiscal representation?
--
Foreign mail order companies are subject to VAT in Switzerland if they achieve an annual turnover of 100,000.00 or more from small consignments to Swiss customers.
Small consignments are defined as consignments with a value of goods of up to 65 CHF.

These merchants must designate a person resident in Switzerland as their VAT fiscal representative. The fiscal representative registers the merchant in the Swiss VAT register.

[#27QWIBEH]
=== Default export matrix for active variations

The basic logic of Galaxus is like this:

If positive stock is transmitted, Galaxus uses the default delivery time that is saved for the account in the Galaxus back end. If an item does not have positive stock, the reorder time is used instead.

*_Notes:_*

* Galaxus assumes an average delivery time of 2 days for items that are in stock. If an item has stock and an availability that results in a delivery time of 2 or more days, the item is exported with a stock of 0\. The delivery time is exported as the reorder time. For items with 0 or negative stock and an average delivery time of two days or less, the system assumes a configuration error and the item is not exported.

* Item data is processed irrespective of the stock export conditions for export.

* Bundles are not exported if one of the items in it are not in stock. Also, the exported stock amount is based on the bundle component with the highest stock.

The following table shows a default export matrix for active variations.

[[standard-export-matrix]]
.Default export matrix for active variations
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Net stock| Average delivery period| Result

| Positive stock
| Delivery time *<= 2*
| Stock is exported.

|Positive stock
| Delivery time *> 2*
| Only delivery time is exported.

|Positive stock
| No *Delivery time*
| Stock is exported.

|Stock 0/negative
| *Delivery time <= 2*
| No export.

|Stock 0/negative
| *Delivery time > 2*
| Only delivery time is exported.

|Stock 0/negative
| *No delivery time*
| No export.

[#PEHWFNZB]
== Particularities of the Galaxus order processing

* Galaxus return requests generate new plentymarkets orders of the type *Return*. These orders are linked to the initial order. The resulting orders must be processed separately.

* Go to *Order » Overview » Item » Edit » Delivery date* to enter the delivery date. If no delivery date is saved, a delivery date is calculated based on the following formula: +
[Day the event procedure "Send Order Confirmation to Galaxus" was triggered] + 2 working days

* A shipping date is also not set if the item quantity needed to fulfil the order is not available as net stock. The planned delivery date can change based on the plugin option *Positive stock quantities are always exported, independent of the average delivery period* in the menu *Setup » Markets » Galaxus » Tab: Product Stock Price*.

* In all scenarios where only a part of the order is to be processed (return/shipping), the imported order must be split. The resulting orders must be processed separately. +
  How to split an order:
  . Go to *Order » [Open order]*.
  . Split the order from *Order » Overview » Gear (split)*. +
  → The window *Split order* opens.
  . Select the item quantities for the new order. +
  *_Important:_* The shipping costs of the original order will not be changed. +
  → After splitting an order, the plugin can inform Galaxus without any additional user input.

  * Orders with an invoice address in Liechtenstein and a delivery address in the EU are imported as net orders.

[#5JRKNOXB]
== Order data exchange: scenarios

The Galaxus plugin supports the following scenarios.

*_Important:_* All scenarios except cancellation requests can be applied to both complete orders and partial orders. As such and to avoid duplicate content, scenarios for complete orders are not described separately.

[#9KO6USYT]
=== The imported order is ready for shipping

The imported order contains all required information and is ready to be shipped:

. The order import was automatically reported back to Galaxus by the event procedure *Send Order confirmation to Galaxus*.
. When your order is ready to be shipped, trigger event procedure *Send shipping confirmation to Galaxus*.

[#2NNFPG4P]
=== Only part of the imported order can be fulfilled

Only part of the imported order can be fulfilled at this time. The customer agrees to receive half of the oder now. The other half will be sent at a later date:

. Go to *Order » [Open order]*.
. Click on *Split*.
. If a later delivery date has been agreed upon with the customer, go to *New order » Overview » Item » Edit » Delivery date*.
. Enter the delivery date.
. Save the settings.
. Trigger the event procedure *Send Order Confirmation to Galaxus* to inform Galaxus about the new delivery date.
. When finished, trigger event procedure *Send Shipping Confirmation to Galaxus*.

[#6T87DOXB]
=== Parts of an order cannot be fulfilled

. Go to *Order » [Open order]*.
. Click on *Split*.
. Trigger the event procedure *Send Order Confirmation to Galaxus*.
. Trigger the event procedure *Merchant Cancels notification to Galaxus*.
. Galaxus automatically replies with a *Cancellation request*.
. The cancellation request can be *rejected* or *accepted* by triggering either the event procedure *Accept Galaxus cancellation request* or *Reject Galaxus cancellation request with justification*.

[#2CI84ZDL]
=== The customer has requested a partial return

The customer wants to return parts of the order.

. Galaxus receives the return request.
plentymarkets creates a new order of the type *Return* that is linked to the initial order.
. Trigger the event procedure *Send Order Confirmation to Galaxus*.
. Trigger the event procedure *Accept Galaxus Return Request* or *Reject Galaxus Return Request with Explanation*.

[#Q7LT0ZU3]
=== The customer has rejected the package

The customer did not accept your delivery for an unjustified reason. The package has now been returned to you.

. Open the order.
. Create a new order of the type *Return*.
	* Go to *Order » Overview*.
	* Open the drop-down list *Return*.
	* Click on *Create*.
. Create a return for the necessary quantity.
. Trigger the event *Accept cancellation to merchant* oder *Cancellation to merchant denied with justification*.

*_Note:_*
