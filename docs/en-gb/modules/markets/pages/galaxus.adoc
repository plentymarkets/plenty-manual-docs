|===

=== Default export matrix for active variations

The basic logic of Galaxus is like this:

If positive stock is transmitted, Galaxus uses the default delivery time that is saved for the account in the Galaxus back end. If an item does not have positive stock, the reorder time is used instead.

*_Notes:_*

* Galaxus assumes an average delivery time of 2 days for items that are in stock. If an item has stock and an availability that results in a delivery time of 2 or more days, the item is exported with a stock of 0\. The delivery time is exported as the reorder time. For items with 0 or negative stock and an average delivery time of two days or less, the system assumes a configuration error and the item is not exported.

* Item data is processed irrespective of the stock export conditions for export.

* Bundles are not exported if one of the items in it are not in stock. Also, the exported stock amount is based on the bundle component with the highest stock.

The following table shows a default export matrix for active variations.

[[standard-export-matrix]]
.Default export matrix for active variations
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Net stock| Average delivery period| Result

| Positive stock
| Delivery time *<= 2*
| Stock is exported.

|Positive stock
| Delivery time *> 2*
| Only delivery time is exported.

|Positive stock
| No *Delivery time*
| Stock is exported.

|Stock 0/negative
| *Delivery time <= 2*
| No export.

|Stock 0/negative
| *Delivery time > 2*
| Only delivery time is exported.

|Stock 0/negative
| *No delivery time*
| No export.

|===

== Setting up a sales price

Sales prices define the conditions under which a variation is sold at a specific price and on a specific sales channel.

//TODO: Include

. Go to *Setup » Item » Sales prices*.
. Click on *[+] New*.
. Enter a *position number*.
. Enter an *internal* and an *external* *name*.
. Enter a value for *Minimum quantity*.
. Select *CHF* or *EUR* as the *currency*.
. Select the *Client*.
. Select the *sales countries*.
. Select the referrer *Galaxus*.
. Save the settings.

*_Note:_* Alternatively, you can activate the referrer *Galaxus* in an existing sales price.

== Preparing variations for the export

* The variations must be *Active*: +
  . Go to *Item » Variation » Settings » Area: Availability* and activate the option *Active*.

*  The *item availability* for the market *Galaxus* must be activated. +
  . Go to *Item » Variation » Tab: Availability » Area: Markets*.
  . Select the market *Galaxus*.

* A Galaxus *SKU* must exist. +
  . Go to *Item » Variation » Tab: Availability » Area: SKU*.
  . Create an *SKU* for the referrer *Galaxus*.

* A Galaxus *sales price* must exist. +
  . Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Sales prices*.
  . Open the sales price.
  . Activate the referrer *Galaxus*.

* Permitted *characteristics* and/or *properties* must be linked to the variations. +
  . Go to *Item » Characteristics » Galaxus characteristics*.
  . Link the relevant elements.
  . *_Or:_* Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties*.
  . Link the relevant elements.

* *Attribute* linked to the item are also exported.

* The *Availabilities 1-10* must be saved for the variation. +
  . Go to *Setup » Item » Availability*.
  . Save business relevant *Average delivery times*.
  . Ensure that variations activated for Galaxus are linked to the relevant *Availability 1-10*. +
  *_Important:_* The setting *Positive stock quantities are always exported, independent of the average delivery period* does not work if no *Availability 1-10* is set.

== Exporting items to Galaxus

The Galaxus plugin exports the item data using the *Elastic Export plugin*. For more information on the *Elastic Export Plugin*, visit the xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#[Elastic Export] page.

=== Setting up Elastic Export formats

The following Elastic Export formats are used for the item export. When you provision the plugin, these formats are installed automatically.

* *GalaxusProductDataExport*
* *GalaxusProductPropertiesExport*
* *GalaxusStockPricingExport*

. Go to *Data » Elastic Export » New export [+]*. +
→ Each format works for a specific part of the item export.
. Select a Galaxus format:
  * *GalaxusProductDataExport*
  * *GalaxusProductPropertiesExport*
  * *GalaxusProductStockPricingExport*
. Set up the export formats.
. *Save* the settings.

[[elastic-export-configuration]]
.Plugin relevant Elastic Export setup options
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
|Setting |Explanation

| Name
| Enter a name

* The export format is listed under this name in the overview of the *Exports* tab.

| Type
| Select the type *item* from the drop-down list.

| Format
| Select one of the three relevant data export formats.

| Enter a whole number. This number determines how many items are exported at maximum. Enter an integer between *0* and *9999*.

| Generate cache file
| Place a check mark if you want to export more than 9999 data records to the interface. We recommend that you do not activate this setting for more than 20 export formats. This is to ensure a high performance of the Elastic Export. Depending on the user configuration and amount of data, it can take more than 24 hours to update the cache file.

| Provisioning
| Privisioning via *URL* or *FTP*. If you select the method *FTP*, the FTP credentials and the export interval *Daily/Hourly* must be specified

| URL
| If you select the option *URL*, click on *Generate token* to create an access token.

| File name
| Name your export files as follows:

* GalaxusProductDataExport = *ProductData_Merchantname.csv*
* GalaxusProductStockPricingExport = *ProductStockPricing_Merchantname.csv*
* GalaxusProductPropertiesExport = *ProductProperties_Merchantname.csv*

| Item filter
| Allow you to set up the export more granularly and thus ensure that only a specific subset of items is exported to Galaxus. Note that the plugin cannot use the following *Elastic Export* filters:

* Item creation date
* Default, Bundle, Bundle component
* Item type
* Positive stock for given warehouse
* Positive physical stock in the selected warehouse
* Prices
* Tags AND mode
* Tags OR mode
* Item update date

| Add item filters
| Plugin relevant item filters are *Active* and *Markets » Galaxus*

Select an item filter from the drop-down list and click on *Add*. There are no filters selected by default.

| Client
| Default client

| Order referrer
| Select the order referrer that should be assigned during the order import from the drop-down list. In this case, this is: *Galaxus*

| Barcode
| Select the ASIN, ISBN or an EAN from the drop-down list. Selection must be linked to the referrer *Galaxus*. Otherwise, the barcode selection is not exported

| Sales price
| The exported sales price is always the *Sales price net*. The select *Sales price gross* is ignored during export.

|===

==== Example: Setting up the event procedure "Send order confirmation to Galaxus"

For example, set up an event procedure to send automatic order confirmations to Galaxus:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Events*.
. Click on *Add event procedure*. +
→ The *Create new event procedure* window opens.
. Enter a *name*.
. Select the order event *Order change > Status change*.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The settings of the event procedure are shown.
. Add a *Filter* with the selection *Order » Order type » Order*.
. Add a *Filter* with the selection *Order » Referrer » Galaxus*.
. Add an *Action* with the selection *Plugins » Send order confirmation to Galaxus*.
. *Save* the settings.

=== Particularities of the Galaxus order processing

* Orders with invoice addresses in Switzerland and delivery addresses in the EU are imported as net orders.

* In all scenarios where only a part of the order is to be processed (return/shipping), the imported order must be split. The resulting orders must be processed separately.

* Statuses for rejecting partial cancellation requests and cancellation requests must be set by the user. Go to *Setup » Markets » Galaxus » Order import » Order status configuration*. When no option is selected, the status *[5] Cleared for shipping* is automatically set.

* After splitting an order, the plugin can inform Galaxus without any additional user input.

* Galaxus return requests generate new plentymarkets orders of the type *Return*. These orders are linked to the initial order. The resulting orders must be processed separately.

* The default delivery date for Galaxus orders is: Day on which the event procedure *Send order confirmation to Galaxus* was triggered *+ 2 working days* unless a different delivery date was entered in the menu *Order » Overview » Item » Edit » Delivery date* earlier. A shipping date is also not set if the item quantity needed to fulfil the order is not available as net stock. The planned delivery date can change based on the plugin option *Positive stock quantities are always exported, independent of the average delivery period* in the menu *Setup » Markets » Galaxus » Tab: Product Stock Price*.

* For Galaxus delivery notes, carry out the following settings in addition to your default delivery note settings:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Delivery note*.
. In the area *Optional elements below stock unit table*, select *Yes* for the option *External Order Number*.
. Insert the note agreed on with Galaxus in the field *Note*. +
    +

. *Save* the changes.

==== Splitting an order: an example

. Go to *Order » Order ID*.
. Split the order from *Order » Overview » Gear (split)*. +
→ The window *Split order* opens.
. Select the item quantities for the new order. +
*_Important:_* The shipping costs of the original order will not be changed.

=== Order data exchange: scenarios

The Galaxus plugin supports the following scenarios:

*_Important:_* All scenarios except cancellation requests can be executed for either the whole or a part of the order. Therefore, to minimize duplicate content, these scenarios only describe workflows for partial orders.

=== The imported order is ready for shipping

The imported order contains all required information and is now ready to be shipped:

. The order import was automatically reported back to Galaxus by the event procedure *Send Order confirmation to Galaxus*.
. Once your order is ready to be shipped, trigger event procedure *Send shipping confirmation to Galaxus*.

=== Only part of the imported order can be fulfilled

Only part of the imported order can be fulfilled at this time. The customer agrees to receive half of the order now, the other half is to be sent at an agreed upon delivery date:
