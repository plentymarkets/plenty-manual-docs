:description: Learn how to set up the market Fruugo in your plentymarkets system to start selling your items on Fruugo. On Fruugo, customers can go shopping in their own country's language and currency.

:market: Fruugo
:fruugo:

link:https://sell.fruugo.com/[Fruugo^] is a global market which allows customers to shop in their own country’s language and currency. Item descriptions are automatically translated into the target language and prices are converted into the local currency. This strengthens your international presence without major expenditure in terms of time or money.

[#100]
== Registering with Fruugo

You need to register with link:https://sell.fruugo.com/en/registration[Fruugo^] before setting up Fruugo in plentymarkets.

== Data exchange

Connecting to this market allows for the following automatic functions to take place:

* Item data is picked up by Fruugo from a feed where the plugin posts CSV files that have been generated by a specialised plentymarkets catalogue template. Stock details are synchronised using a separate Fruugo Inventory Status API.
* Hourly order import
* Automatically create a new customer data record during the order import. This is assuming no customer data record has yet been saved in the database
* The plugin processes item data and stock. The order interface is part of the plentymarkets back end and is independent of the plugin.

[IMPORTANT]
.No interface for stock and price synchronisation
====
Fruugo does currently not provide an interface for automatically synchronising stock and prices. Instead, Fruugo exports data from plentymarkets via the data export URL which has to be transferred to Fruugo after registration and setup. Fruugo decides how often the data export takes place depending on the data Fruugo receives from your sales on the market.

Only items with stock are exported to Fruugo.
====

[#170]
== Installing the plugin

To connect to Fruugo in plentymarkets, first install the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/fruugo_6875[Fruugo plugin^] in your plentymarkets system. You can download this and other plugins in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en[plentyMarketplace^].
