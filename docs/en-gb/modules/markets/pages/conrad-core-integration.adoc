[#add-product-categories]
=== Adding product categories

Before you can create catalogues for Conrad, you have to add the product categories in which you want to offer your items on Conrad. This is done in the *Setup » Markets » Conrad » Add catalogue templates* menu. +

[#link-product-category]
=== Linking variations to a Conrad product category

[TIP]
.Which variations are exported to Conrad?
====
You can use catalogue filters in the menu *Data » Catalogues » [Open catalogue] » Filters* to define which variations should be exported to Conrad. The filters *Conrad* and *Active* are already set by default. This means that all variations which are *active* and which have the market availability for Conrad in the *Availability* tab will be exported to Conrad. +
You can use the *custom filters* in the catalogue to define in detail which variations should be exported to Conrad.
====

You can use properties to define in which product category on Conrad a variation should be listed. For example, you can create the property *Conrad product categories* of the type selection and use the Conrad product categories as selection values. You can then use the filters in the catalogue and filter for the property to define into which product category on Conrad the variations should be exported.

[.instruction]
Creating a property of the type selection:

. Go to *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration*.
. Click on material:add[] *Create property*. +
→ The settings for the new property are displayed.
. In the area *Details*, select the *type* *selection*.
. In the area *Details*, select the *section* *Items*.
. Carry out the additional settings. +
→ *_Tip:_* For example, you can use *Conrad product category* as name for the property.
. Save (material:save[]) the settings. +
→ The property is created.
. In the area *Selection values*, click on *Create selection value*.
. Enter a name for the selection value. +
→ *_Tip:_* You can enter the different Conrad product categories as names for the selection values.
. Save (material:save[]) the settings. +
→ The selection value is created and displayed in the overview. The value automatically receives a consecutive and unique ID that cannot be changed. You need this ID to only export specific variations in a catalogue.

Next, link the desired variations with the selection property that you created.

[.instruction]
Link variation with property:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Variation properties* area, select the property you created from the *Properties* drop-down list and click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is added.
. Select the desired product category from the drop-down list *Value*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

Afterwards, add the ID of the selection value as filter in the desired Conrad catalogue.

*_Tip:_* Open the property in the menu *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration* to see the IDs of the selection values.

[.instruction]
Apply filters in the catalogue:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*.
. Open the Conrad catalogue.
. On the left-hand side, open the tab *Filters*.
. In the area *Custom filters*, select the filter *Linked to at least one property selection value*.

*_Tip:_* Open the property in the menu *Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration* to see the IDs of the selection values.
. Save (material:save[]) the settings.

[#create-catalogue]
=== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to Conrad using catalogues. To export your items to Conrad, create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogue* menu. Afterwards, link the Conrad data fields with item data saved in plentysystems in the catalogue. +
After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to Conrad in regular intervals.

*_Note:_* There is a separate catalogue format for each Conrad product category. Different item data is exported in the different catalogue formats, depending on which information Conrad requires for each product category. +
This means that you have to create a separate catalogue for each Conrad product category that you want to sell your items in. Go to *Setup » Markets » Conrad » Add catalogue templates* to add product categories.

[IMPORTANT]
.Create a catalogue for offers
====
For Conrad, you always have to create a catalogue for offers. To do so, select the format *Offer* when you create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogues* menu. +
The offer catalogue is required in addition to the catalogues for the different Conrad product categories so that offers can be created on Conrad. +
*_Note:_* Offers can only be exported if an item has already been activated. If an item has not been activated by Conrad, then the offer cannot be exported.
