== Registering with eMAG

First, register as a seller with eMAG. You can register link:https://marketplace-leads.emag.ro/[on the eMAG website]. +

== Products vs. Offers

* Whoever lists item data for a product first on {market} becomes the owner of this *_product_*. Only owners can update the item data of the product. The owner's price is displayed to the right of the item description.
* All other merchants can only publish prices and stocks for the product. As such, they do not publish a product. Instead, they publish an *_offer_*. This information is shown below the item description as "other offers".

*_Important:_* eMAG checks all product and offer data manually before publication on the market.

== Workflow item data export

*_Scenario 1: You want to list a product on {market} that no one else is offering on the market._*

* You export the item data for the first time. To do so, you use the catalogue format *eMAG Products*.
* {market} checks all item data manually. Patience is a virtue.
* {market} assigns a unique Part Number Key to the product. {market} also calls this key a PNK code. The PI is automatically saved in plentymarkets as an SKU and now serves as the unique identification key.
* You become the owner of the product page. This means that only you are allowed to update the item data of this product. All other sellers can only publish offers for this product. As such, they can only export prices and stock information.
* Every time you update the item data, someone at {market} manually checks the data again.

image:markets:emag-owner.png[]

*_Scenario 2: You want to list a product on {market} that is already offered on the market._*

* You export the item data for the first time. To do so, you use the catalogue format *eMAG Offers*.
* When you export an offer for the first time, {market} uses the EAN to match the offer to the correct product. Afterwards, the PNK is automatically saved as an SKU in plentymarkets and now serves as the unique identification key.
* Your offer is published on the product page below the item description as an additional offer.

[#JRBA6MUV]
== Workflow of an order

This is the order workflow for {market}:

* Your products are listed on {market}.
* Customers place an order on {market}.
* Customers make their payments to {market}.
* → The order is imported to plentymarkets. +
*_Note:_* Customers make their payments to {market}. As such, orders are imported with *Status [5] Cleared for shipping*.
* You ship the order.
* You notify {market} about shipping by triggering an event procedure.
// Invoices are currently not imported. Developers will look into it.

Now set up the market in plentymarkets.

=== Completing the assistants

Use the assistant *Base settings - eMAG* in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu to quickly and conveniently set up eMAG in plentymarkets. Moreover, you set up the data transfer to OTTO Market. Keep the credentials of your eMAG account at hand. You have received these credentials from eMAG.

*_Reminder:_* eMAG offers 3 independent markets for the countries Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. You create a separate connection to eMAG for each of these markets. So if you want to sell on several eMAG markets, you need to complete the assistant several times.

=== Creating a catalogue

To export your items to eMAG, create catalogues in the *Data » Catalogue* menu. There are two export types for eMAG: The export type *eMAG Products* and the export type *eMAG Offers*.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

[tabs]
====
Creating a catalogue for products::
+
--
Products are exported using the export type *eMAG Products*. As the format, you select the category in which you want to publish the products of the catalogue. Note that eMAG has to activate you for each category. If you are not activated for a category, your products will not be published in the category.

[.instruction]
Creating a catalogue:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*.
. Click on *Create catalogue* (material:add[]).
. Enter a name for the catalogue.
. In the drop-down list *Export type*, select the option *eMAG Products*.
. In the drop-down list *Format type*, select the option *Item (new)*.
. In the drop-down list *Format*, select a category of the marketplace. +
*_Important:_* eMAG has to activate you for each category in which you want to sell your items.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings. +
→ The catalogue is created. +
→ The catalogue is opened for editing. +
. On the left-hand side of the menu, click on material:settings[] *Settings*.
. In the *Basic settings*, select the *account* that you want to use this catalogue for.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

Creating a catalogue for offers::

Offers are exported using the export type *eMAG Offers*. There is only one format for this export type. All offers are therefore exported with only one catalogue.

[.instruction]

. Enter a name for the catalogue.
. In the drop-down list *Export type*, select the option *eMAG Offers*. +

===== Other catalogue settings

Other catalogue settings are optional. Once you carried out the settings described on this page, your catalogue is automatically exported to {market}. That means you can ignore the catalogue settings for *Format settings*, *Export settings* and *Download settings*.

The *Format settings*, *Export settings*, and *Download settings* allow you xref:data:export-marketplace-formats.adoc#file-export[to create a file with the variation data contained in the catalogue]. However, this file does not contain information about whether the data export to {market} was successful.
endif::url-export,price-search-engine[]

*_Note:_* You should not change the *format* in the catalogue's *Format settings*. To ensure that the export to the market works, all required settings are already configured when you create a catalogue. If you change the settings, errors might occur during the export.

[#PILMA5UF]
=== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. Check the documentation of the sales channel to find out what data the market expects for the individual data fields.
