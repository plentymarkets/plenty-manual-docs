|Setting |Explanation

2+^|Step *Settings*

| *Select the client that should be used to sell your items.*
a| From the drop-down list *Client*, select a client. This client is used to generate the item URL in the catalogue and OTTO Market orders are assigned to this client. +
*_Note:_* In plentymarkets, you can only link one OTTO Market account and only sell items via one client (shop).

| *Would you like to activate your OTTO market user account?*
a| material:check_box_outline_blank[] = The settings are saved but the data exchange with OTTO Market is not started. +
material:check_box[] = Data exchange with OTTO Market is started once the assistant is completed. +
*_Recommendation:_* Check all settings before activating the user account.

2+^|Step *API access data*

| *Enter the API access data.*
a| * *API user* (mandatory input) = Enter the user name for the API interface that you received from OTTO Market.
* *Password* (mandatory input) = Enter the password for the API interface that you received from OTTO Market.

2+^|Step *Data exchange*

| *Would you like to import OTTO market orders into plentymarkets?*
| Activate to automatically import orders once an hour. +
*_Note:_* You need to activate this option to export item data and stock information.

| *Which data would you like to transfer to OTTO market?* +
(only shown if you activated *Import orders*)
a| Select the data to be exported. +
*_Note:_* You need to automatically import orders to export item data and stock information.

* *Item data* = Item data is synchronised once a day during the night.
* *Stock information* = Stock is synchronised every 15 minutes.

| *Would you like to import return announcements from OTTO market into plentymarkets?*
| Activate to import returns that customers create on OTTO Market once per hour. Each returned order item is shown as a separate return in the *Orders* tab of an order.

| *Select the order status for newly imported return announcements.* +
(only shown if you activated *Import return announcements*)
| From the drop-down list, select the status to be assigned to return announcements during import. +
*_Note:_* A return announcement does not guarantee that the customer actually sends the product back to you. As such, select a status that does not trigger any unwanted event procedures, such as event procedures for creating credit notes.

| *Would you like to replace the stock amount for variations with no stock limitation?*
a| Activate *Replace stock* to enter a stock amount.

| *Stock amount* +
(only shown if you activated *Limit stock*)
| Enter the stock amount. This stock amount is sent if the setting *Limit* of a variation is set to *None* or *Do not administer stock for this variation* and stock is less than or equal to 0.

| *Would you like to import purchase receipts as external invoices?*
a| By default, purchase receipts are imported as normal order documents. + If you activate the option *Import purchase receipts as external invoices*, the purchase receipts are imported with the document type *External invoice* instead. +
*_Important:_* If the option is not activated, the order number is not shown in the order overview and is also not exported as part of the financial accounting export. The invoice number is then only shown shown in the *Receipts* tab of the order.

*_Background:_* Until 15/12/2020, the order documents provided by OTTO Market were imported with the document type *External invoice* even though the documents were not proper invoices. If you want to continue to import these documents with the document type *External invoices* due to dependencies to other exports, interfaces or software, activate the option *Import purchase receipts as external invoices*. Visit the link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/aenderung-des-dokumententyps-der-kaufbelege-von-otto-change-of-document-type-of-purchase-receipts-from-otto/619731[plentymarkets forum^] for more details.

2+^|Step *Shipping service provider*

| *Link plentymarkets shipping service provider DHL with:*
| For each plentymarkets shipping service provider, select an OTTO Market shipping service provider from the drop-down list.

2+^|Step *Return shipping service provider*

| *Link plentymarkets shipping service provider DHL with:*
| For each plentymarkets shipping service provider for returns, select the appropriate OTTO Market shipping service provider for returns from the drop-down list.

| *Select a shipping service provider to be used as a fallback option to the assigned return shipping service providers.*
a| Select the shipping service provider that is to be used if return tracking numbers are added to the system via REST API. For example, return tracking numbers are added via REST API if you work with an external fulfilment company that is connected via this API. For return tracking numbers that are added via REST API, the assignments for *OTTO Market shipping service provider for returns* cannot be applied. +
*_Note:_* No return shipping service providers are shown in the drop-down list? Then install at least one plugin for shipping service providers. You can download the plugins from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/fulfillment-stock/shipping[plentyMarketplace^].

* *Use service provider from shipping profile* (Default option) = The shipping service provider of the order’s shipping profile is also used as the shipping service provider for the return.
* *Alternative return shipping service provider* = Select a shipping service provider from the drop-down list. This shipping service provider is used for all shipments to which the assignments above cannot be applied.
* *No alternative shipping service provider* = No attempt is made to select an alternative shipping service provider for the return. +
*_Note:_* Every shipping confirmation that you send to OTTO Market must contain a tracking number to be used for a possible return. As such, if you select the option *No alternative shipping service provider*, the shipping confirmation may not be sent to OTTO Market.

== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to OTTO Market via catalogues. Use the assistant *Create catalogues - OTTO Market* to create a marketplace format for every OTTO category group.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Items cannot be deleted at OTTO Market
====
An item cannot be deleted at OTTO Market, neither by plentymarkets nor by OTTO. It is only possible to mark the item as *not available* at OTTO Market. Therefore, make extra sure that the correct data fields are mapped in the catalogue prior to transferring your items.

[.collapseBox]
.Step *Required fields*
--
In this step of the assistant, you decide which variation data saved in plentymarkets you want to export to the market. To do so, you are going to map each mandatory field data field of the market to the plentymarkets data field that contains the data that you want to export to the market. Each market specifies their own mandatory fields. Instead of mapping an existing plentymarkets data field, you can also create a property for some fields directly in the assistant.

'''
*Parent SKU* = From the drop-down list, select the plentymarkets data field that contains the parent SKU.

'''
*SKU* = From the drop-down list, select the plentymarkets data field that contains the SKU.

'''
*Select plentymarkets data field* = A data field that already exists in plentymarkets will be exported to OTTO Market. Select the data field from the drop-down list *plentymarkets Data field*. +
*_Note:_* The mappings you create will not be checked in terms of logic. As such, check your mappings carefully before starting the export.

'''
*Creating a property* = Creates a property and maps this property to the marketplace data field. This automatically created property will be saved in the xref:item:properties.adoc#[Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration] menu.

The property is created with the following settings:

* Section = Item
* Type = _depending on the market’s requirements_
* Language = German
* Name = Field of the OTTO category group
* Group = OTTO Market

'''
*Creating a sales price* = Creates a sales price and maps this sales price to the marketplace data field. You can check and edit this sales price in the xref:item:prices.adoc#[Setup » Item » Sales prices] menu.

The sales price is created with the following settings:

* Subscription interval = None
* Internal name = OTTO Market
* External name = OTTO Market
* Minimum quantity = 1
* Live conversion = No
* Currency = Euro
* Display = Always display for new items
* Client = ALL
* Class = ALL
* Country = Germany

'''
*Create barcode* = Creates a barcode *OTTO Market* and maps this barcode to the data field. If a barcode with the name *OTTO Market* already exists in the system, that barcode is mapped instead. You can check and edit this barcode in the xref:item:barcodes.adoc#100[Setup » Item » Barcodes] menu.
--

[#600]
=== Mapping additional data fields in the catalogue (not in assistant)

You have already mapped important mandatory fields for the OTTO category group in the assistant. However, after you have completed the assistant, you need to map additional data fields to send more information regarding your products to OTTO Market.

TIP: Map at least the marketplace data fields *Brand*, *Delivery type* and *Category* with plentymarkets data fields.

[#905]
=== Particularities for mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. As such, there are some particularities for each market when mapping data fields. <<#catalogue-otto-market-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for OTTO Market.

| *Category*
| OTTO Market publishes current information in the category list “Kategorienliste”. Open the link:https://og2gether-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/micha_saake_otto_de/EXg5Id8bTxNKuV8mRkQ1wrsBNFuBrjP8iQJINZjcezvjdg?rtime=ueiZ-kgf2Ug[tab "Übersicht Kategorien" (category overview)^]. This document is only available in German.

| *"My Otto" Identification Number* +
(mandatory)
| The "My Otto" Identification Number (MOIN) is a unique product barcode assigned by OTTO Market. From 11/08/2021, OTTO market assigns a unique MOIN to every variation.

* In the catalogue, the marketplace data field *"My Otto" Identification Number* is automatically mapped to the plentymarkets data field *MOIN*.
* Your variations are automatically given a MOIN: When your variations are exported, OTTO Market assigns a MOIN to each variation.
* Each variation is given a MOIN in one of two ways:
  ** *_Alternative 1:_* The product is already available on OTTO Market. +
  → Your variation is assigned an existing MOIN. +
  ** *_Alternative 2:_* The product is not yet available on OTTO Market. +
  → OTTO Market creates a new MOIN and assigns is to your variation.

The workflow is the same in both cases:

. The variation is exported to OTTO Market.
. 15 minutes later, OTTO assigns a MOIN to the variation.
. The MOIN is imported to your plentymarkets system and saved to the variation data. You can find the MOIN in the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: ASIN/ePID/MOIN*.
. For all subsequent exports, the MOIN is exported to OTTO Market with your other item data. +
*_Note:_* It can take up to two nights before your variation is available for sale on Offer Market when you export a variation for the first time that other sellers already offer on OTTO Market.

| *Stock*
| *_Note:_* Items may only be shipped from foreign warehouses after this has been agreed upon with OTTO. Furthermore, items may only be shipped to customers located in Germany, unless otherwise agreed upon with OTTO. +

There are several ways to export stock data:

* To export stock of one warehouse:
  . Map the plentymarkets data field *Stock » [Select warehouse]*.

* To export stock of several warehouses:
  . Map the plentymarkets data field *Stock » [Select warehouse]*.
  . Click on *Add fallback data field* (icon:link[role="black"]) and use the plentymarkets data field *Stock » [Select warehouse]* to map another warehouse. You can also add more than one fallback data field. +
  → The total stock of all warehouses is exported that were added as data fields and fallback data fields.

* To export the sum of net stock in all sales warehouses:
  . Map the plentymarkets data field *Stock » Virtual warehouse*.

* To export a numerical value saved for a variation:
  . Create and map a property of the type *Whole number*.
  . Links the property with the variation.
  . Save a numerical value for the variation.

*_Note:_* If you map no warehouse and no property to the marketplace data field *Stock*, the sum of the net stock of all sales warehouses is exported to OTTO Market. This is the same as mapping the plentymarkets data field *Stock » Virtual warehouse*.

| *Sales price currency*; +
*RRP currency*; +
*Offer price currency*
| OTTO Market can only process the currency EURO. For this reason, these marketplace data fields are filled with the value “EUR” automatically.

| *Sales price amount*; +
*Sales price unit*; +
*Unit price amount*; +
*Unit price unit*
| OTTO Market uses these marketplace data fields to calculate the unit price of variations.

*_Important:_* To export the unit price to OTTO Market, content and unit information must be saved for the variation. To save this information, go to *Item » Edit item » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Dimensions » Setting: Content*.

For the setting *Content*, you enter a *Content value* and select a *Content unit*:

image::markets:otto-unitprice-variation-setting.png[]

We recommend the following mappings for unit price calculation:

[cols="2,4a"]
!===
! *OTTO Market data field*
! *Setting in plentymarkets*/ *explanation*

! Sales price amount
! * *Variation » Content quantity*

The sales price amount is the quantity of the variation’s content. As such, you need to specify the content of the variation that is saved in the variation’s dimensions.

! Unit price amount
! * Property with the values that are allowed by OTTO (`1`, `100` and/or `1000`)

The unit price amount is used to calculate the unit price. OTTO allows the values *1*, *100* or *1000*. Map this field to a property with the values *1*, *100* and/or *1000*. +
*_Tip:_* If all variations for this catalogue have a unit price amount of *1*, you do not need to map the field *Unit price amount*. If the field is not mapped, the value *1* is exported by default.

! Unit price unit
! * *Variation » Content unit » [Enter ISO code of unit]*

image::markets:otto-unitprice-mappings.png[]

*_Tip:_* Go to *Setup » Item » Units* to find the ISO codes in the column *ISO*. +
*_Example:_* For *Unit*, OTTO expects the value"C62".

image::markets:otto-unitprice-iso.png[]

_or_

* Property with the values that are allowed by OTTO Market (ISO codes)

image::markets:otto-unitprice-mappings-salesprice.png[]

Go to *Setup » Item » Units* to find the ISO codes in the column *ISO*. +
*_Example:_* For *Unit*, OTTO expects the value"C62".

image::markets:otto-unitprice-iso.png[]

The unit price unit relates to the content unit saved in the variation’s dimensions. OTTO Market expects the ISO code of the unit.

*_Tip:_* You do not save the ISO code in the variation. Instead, select a unit from the drop-down list for the setting *Content*:

image::markets:otto-unitprice-content.png[]

! Sales price unit
! * *Variation » Content unit » [Enter ISO code of unit]* +
*_Tip:_* Go to *Setup » Item » Units* to find the ISO codes in the column *ISO*. +
*_Example:_* For *Unit*, OTTO expects the value"C62".

_or_

* Property with the values that are allowed by OTTO (ISO codes)

The sales price unit is the unit of the variation’s setting *Content*. OTTO Market expects the ISO code of the unit.

2+^| Media Assets

| *Image*
| *_Recommendation:_* Map the plentymarkets data field *Image » item/catalogs/variation/image.image-image*.
This data field exports all images that are made available for the referrer *OTTO Market*. +

*_Note:_* The minimum dimensions for images uploaded to OTTO Market are 500 x 1000 pixels.

| Other media asset data fields +
(*Dimensional drawing*; +
*Colour variations*; +
*Energy efficiency label*; +
*Material sample*; +
*Product data sheet*; +
*User manual* +
etc.)
| Only URLs to files can be exported for media asset data fields. The only exception to this rule is the data field *Images* (see above).

*_Recommended mapping:_*

* Properties of the type *Character string* for saving the URL to the appropriate file. +
*_Important:_* You cannot link properties of the type *File* because OTTO Market can only read URLs. Every property can only contain one URL.

| _Length specifications_
| Length specifications have to be indicated with a decimal point. Otherwise, the values will not be exported correctly. +

*_Example:_* 2.5 m

[#weee-take-back]
==== Mapping attributes for electrical devices and WEEE take back

As of 1 January 2022, sellers are legally obliged to offer collection of an equivalent old device when customers buy a new electrical device.

For OTTO market, you can use the attributes *Geräteart laut ElektroG* (type of electrical device) and *WEEE-Reg.-Nr. DE* to indicate whether it is an electrical device or whether WEEE take back is possible. Match these attributes with plentymarkets data fields in the *Category group related attributes* section of the corresponding OTTO market catalogue.

[discrete]
===== Information about WEEE take back in the order

If the order contains an electrical device and customers request WEEE take back, an *OrderItemProperty* with the ID 92 is added to the relevant order item of the order and the text "[inkl. Altgerätemitnahme/incl. WEEE take back]" is added to the item name.

=== Linking data fields created in the assistant with variations

:property-group: OTTO Market

include::partial$catalogue-assistant-link-variations.adoc[]

[#475]
=== Linking variations with OTTO category groups

After you created a marketplace format for OTTO Market with the *OTTO Market Creating catalogues* assistant or manually, the property *OTTO category group* is created in your plentymarkets system. A new selection value is added to the *OTTO category group* property for each OTTO category group selected in the *Name and category group* step of the assistant. In order for your variations to be exported in the appropriate catalogue, they have to be linked to the *OTTO category group* property in the *Properties* tab of a variation.

[.instruction]
Linking a variation with an OTTO category group:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the area *Variation properties*, select the property *OTTO category group* from the *Properties* drop-down list.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is added.
. Select the desired category group from the *Value* drop-down list for the *OTTO category group* property. +
*_Note:_* The export to OTTO Market contains the name of the catalogue, not the name of the marketplace format. +
→ The variation will be exported in this catalogue. +
*_Example:_* If you select the value *Betten* (Beds), then the variation will be exported in the catalogue for the OTTO category group *Betten*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

include::partial$catalogue-activation.adoc[]

[#deactivating-items]
== Deactivating items on OTTO Market

Variations cannot be sold on OTTO Market if they do not have stock in plentymarkets. As stock data is transferred to OTTO Market every 15 minutes, variations without stock are deleted automatically. If a variation has stock again in plentymarkets, it is offered again on OTTO Market with the next stock export.

If you do not want to sell a variation which is in stock in plentymarkets on OTTO Market, then you have to delete the availability for the market and update the timestamp for market exports.

[.instruction]
Deleting the availability:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Variation tab: Availability*.
. *Delete* (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]) the availability *OTTO market*.
. *Save* (terra:save[]) the settings.

After you removed the availability, you have to *Update the timestamp for market exports* using the *Item group function*. This ensures that a stock of *0* is transferred to OTTO Market.

[.instruction]
Updating the timestamp for market exports:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » Tab: Item group function*.
. Place a check mark next to *Update timestamp for market exports*.
. Click on terra:execute[] *Execute*. +
→ A stock of *0* is transferred to OTTO Market. +
→ The variation is deactivated on OTTO Market and cannot be bought any longer.

[#1050]
== OTTO Market order management

This chapter describes how OTTO Market orders are processed.

[#1100]
=== Order import

* OTTO Market orders are imported into plentymarkets with status *[3] Waiting for payment*.
* Orders with the OTTO Market status ANNOUNCED are imported to plentymarkets without address details and with the status *[1] Incomplete data*. These are orders that can still be cancelled by the customer, or orders with the payment method cash in advance that have not been paid. As soon as the order changes to the status PROCESSABLE at OTTO Market, the address is added to the order and the order is moved to status *[4] In preparation for shipping*. Orders with the payment method cash in advance are moved to status *[3] Waiting for payment*. +

[TIP]
.Reserving stock for orders with the payment method cash in advance
====
*_Important:_* No stock is reserved for orders in status *[1] Invalid data* by default. To make sure that stock is reserved for these orders, go to *Setup » Orders » Settings*. Go to the setting *Status for order reservation (Reservation of stocks)*. For the option *to*, select the status *[1] Incomplete data*. In the drop-down list to the far right, select the option *All orders*.
====

* After an order was confirmed by OTTO Market, the order changes to status *[5] Shipment process started*.
* A payment is created for the order in plentymarkets and the order is marked as *paid*. +
If customers paid an OTTO Market order per bank transfer, it might take longer to confirm the order than for other payment methods. In plentymarkets, the payment method is always *OTTO Payment*. +
* If customers do not pay for an order, the order will be cancelled by OTTO Market after some time. A cancellation will be sent to plentymarkets. In plentymarkets, the unpaid order automatically changes to the status *[8] Cancelled*. +
*_Important:_* You cannot cancel orders in status *[1] Incomplete data* or *[3] Waiting for payment*.


[#1200]
=== Invoice import

* Invoices for OTTO Market orders are generated by OTTO Market and automatically imported into plentymarkets after you sent a shipping confirmation to OTTO Market. As such, you cannot create invoices for OTTO Market orders in plentymarkets.
* Shipping confirmations are sent with the event procedure <<#700, Send shipping confirmation to OTTO>>.
* The invoice documents can be accessed in the *Receipts* tab of the main order after the shipping confirmation was sent.
* By default, purchase receipts are imported as normal order documents. If you activate the assistant option *Import purchase receipts as external invoices*, the purchase receipts are imported with the document type *External invoice* instead. +
*_Important:_* If the option *Import purchase receipts as external invoices* is not activated, the order number is not shown in the order overview and is also not exported as part of the financial accounting export. The invoice number is then only shown shown in the *Receipts* tab of the order.
* OTTO Market creates invoices when shipping of an item is confirmed. Therefore, invoices are also created for partial deliveries.

[#1400]
=== Credit note import

* Credit notes and partial credit notes for OTTO Market orders are generated by OTTO Market and automatically imported into plentymarkets after you sent a returns confirmation to OTTO Market.
* Once the return has been confirmed, the credit note documents are available in the *Receipts* tab of the order.
* This returns confirmation is sent with the event procedure *Send return to OTTO*.
* When you notify OTTO of a return, the components of the individual order items of the refund/return are sent to OTTO. This means that OTTO will refund the complete sales price of any order item. You cannot notify OTTO Market of a partial refund for a particular order item. As such, even if you adjust the price of an order item, this does not affect the refund document that OTTO creates.
* OTTO Market creates credit notes when the return of an item is confirmed. Therefore, credit notes are also generated for partial returns.

[#500]
== Automating order processing

Set up xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedures] to automatically inform OTTO Market about changes to the order status. The following event procedures can be set up for OTTO Market:

* Generate return label (<<#550, How?>>)
* Send shipping confirmation to OTTO (<<#700, How?>>)
* Send order cancellation to OTTO (<<#800, How?>>)
* Send returns to OTTO (<<#900, How?>>)
* Send return rejection to OTTO (<<#1000, How?>>)

[IMPORTANT]
.Sequence of event procedures
====
Note that event procedures for OTTO market must be triggered in a specific sequence. First, the event procedure <<Generating return labels, Generate return label>> must be triggered and afterwards the event procedure <<Sending shipping confirmations to OTTO, Send shipping confirmation to OTTO>>. If no return label was created, the shipping confirmation cannot be sent to OTTO Market.
====

[#550]
=== Generating return labels

When OTTO Market orders are imported into your plentymarkets system, return labels must be generated for those orders before the shipping confirmation is sent to OTTO Market. An event procedure for creating a return label automatically creates a tracking number for a return (retTrackingNumber) which is saved for the order. This is to ensure that a tracking number exists if customers wish to return an item. +

To ensure that the tracking number is sent to OTTO Market along with the order confirmation, a return label must be created. At the moment, return labels can be created with DHL, Hermes, and GLS Shipping. You need the following shipping service provider plugins:
