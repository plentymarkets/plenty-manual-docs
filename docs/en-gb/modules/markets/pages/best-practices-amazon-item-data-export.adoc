Use this checklist to find out why an item has not been transferred to Amazon. (Also read the explanatory note below.)

[TIP]
.A brief explanation may be useful here:
====
To export item data to Amazon, you can use the *automatic export* which takes place at night. You can also use the *manual export*. To do so, go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Data export*.
In both cases, a CSV file is generated. *This checklist helps you if an item is not available in the generated CSV file.* If the item is available in this CSV file, but it is neither displayed on Amazon nor in your Seller Central, you have to check the Amazon error reports to find out why the item has not been accepted by Amazon.
Note that the data synchronisation with Amazon must be activated (this is done in the basic settings for Amazon).

== How to find out if an item was not exported

If you can answer all of the following questions with *_No_*, then the item was most likely not exported to Amazon.

A. Is the item available in the Seller Central?

B. Is there an error message concerning this item in the Amazon processing reports (in the Seller Central within *Inventory » Add Products via Upload*)?

C. Is the item available in the CSV file which is generated via the manual export in the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Data export* menu?

[TIP]

====
If you want to test whether one or more specific items cannot be exported, you can flag these items. You can filter the flags in the area of manual export.

==== Last change

Check whether the item was last changed within the past 24 hours, as only items which were changed within the past 24 hours are exported.
You can quickly find out when a variation was changed most recently by looking at item's corresponding variation. You can see the date of the most recent change within the line of the save icon.

You can also view it as a table. Switch the view to *Variations* and activate the column *Last change*.

To solve the issue, go to *Item » Batch processing » Tab: Variations* and select the option *Update timestamp for market exports*.

==== Are the settings in the “Availability” tab correct? (for each variation)

The *Web-API* must be activated and the correct *platform* must be selected. (For example, if you want to sell on Amazon.fr, Amazon France has to be activated etc.).

Order referrers must be visbile so that they can be selected. To make them visible in your menu, go to *Setup » Orders » Order referrer*.

[#220]
==== Are the settings in the “Multi-Channel” tab correct?

Make sure that the appropriate product type is saved.

[#230]
==== Are the filters in the basic settings correct?

In the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings* menu, you can define that only items with a specific *flag* should be exported. If the item is not marked with this flag, then it is not exported.
Moreover, you can define that *only items visible in online store* are exported. If the item is not activated for the plentyShop (this is done in the *Edit item » Tab: Settings* menu), then the item will not be exported.

Do not forget to check the other filter settings as well.

[#240]
==== Price

If the sales price set for Amazon is 0.00 or if the sales price is not activated for Amazon, then the item will not be exported.
A standard price must be set. A standard price is a sales price which is neither a special offer nor the RRP.
A price type is defined in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu in the *Price type* option.

[#250]
==== Activate the variation

If the variation is not *activated* (this is done in the *Settings* tab of a variation), then the item will not be exported.

[[active]]

Variations with attribute links and "single item" variations (i.e. items with main variation only) should be activated.

[TIP]
.Deactivating a main variation without attribute link
====
If an item has variations with attribute links but the main variation has no attribute links, then the main variation must be deactivated. Otherwise, the main variation will be exported as single item. The main variation must be active if it has an attribute link.

== How to test if the item was exported

In order to test if you carried out all necessary settings and if the item is exported properly, open the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Data export* menu and click on *Load file*. Afterwards, check if the item is contained in the CSV file that was created.
