This best practice informs you about Amazon’s VAT calculation service VCS and explains what to consider when setting VCS up in plentymarkets.

An overview of VCS and an instruction how to activate it in plentymarkets can be found on the <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#3150, Amazon page of the manual>>.

You can use two different VCS options in plentymarkets:

* VCS Amazon (invoices are generated by Amazon)
* VCS plentymarkets/VCS Lite (invoices are generated by plentymarkets)

In plentymarkets, Amazon VCS is activated in the *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings » [Select Amazon account] » Tab: Settings* menu with the *Generate invoice* option.

[IMPORTANT]
.Requirements for using VCS
====
If you would like to use VCS, some requirements have to be met:

. Amazon VCS must be activated in the Amazon Seller Central.
. Amazon VCS can only be activated in plentymarkets after you have activated it in the Amazon Seller Central.
. The following warehouses must exist in your plentymarkets system:

  .. A warehouse for each Amazon platform on which you sell items
  .. A warehouse for every country that items are shipped from
  .. A warehouse for each Amazon FBA logistic warehouse that you store items in +
  (How to <<markets/amazon/amazon-fba#60, create a warehouse for Amazon FBA>>)
. To ensure that Amazon can calculate your orders with VCS, the tax settings (verified VAT number) must be saved in Seller Central for each country from which your products are sent by either you or by Amazon FBA.
====

[TIP]
.Workflow when you ship orders yourself (MFN)
====
Keep in mind that you have to send a shipping confirmation prior to generating the invoice. Therefore, if you export items outside of the EU, you only receive the invoice in the VCS report from Amazon after having confirmed the shipment.

=== VCS plentymarkets: How to find errors

Currently, the following possibilities are available to find sources of errors when generating Amazon invoices with plentymarkets:

* The order itself
* Logs
* Plugin

[discrete]
===== Identifying potential sources of errors

* Whether an invoice was created for the order can be seen in the order itself.
* Whether VCS reports are imported into plentymarkets can be checked in the *Data » Log* menu with the *identifier* *importVCSConnection*.
* Whether sales tax IDs are imported and adjusted can be checked in the *Data » Log* menu with the *identifier* *importVCSConnection*.
* Whether invoices are uploaded correctly, or whether they are uploaded at all, can be checked in the *Data » Log* menu with the *identifier* *VCS invoice upload*.
* If you activated the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/channels/marktplaetze/amazonvcsdashboard_6279[VCS dashboard plugin^] in your plentymarkets system, then you can check potential problems with data synchronisation between Amazon and plentymarkets in a separate menu. The plugin is available in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/channels/marketplaces[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

If the identifiers listed above are not available in the log or if there are no entries for these identifiers, then the process was not executed yet.
