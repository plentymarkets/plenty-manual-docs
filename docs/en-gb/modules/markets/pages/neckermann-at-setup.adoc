== Generating Neckermann invoices

The process for generating Neckermann invoices differs from the process for other order referrers. This is why there is an additional menu for generating Neckermann invoices in plentymarkets. Invoices for Neckermann orders are not generated in your plentymarkets system, as is the case for invoices with other order referrers. Instead, your plentymarkets system receives a special file (pcl format) directly from Neckermann, which contains the orders that you received.

You can carry out settings related to the layout of the invoices in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Invoice* menu. Go to *Setup » Orders » Events* in order to define which additional procedure should be carried out when the invoice is printed. If you would like the procedure to be limited to orders from the Neckermann market only, then make sure that you create a filter with the *Referrer* filter type and select *Neckermann* within the filter.

Use the *Generate Neckermann invoices* menu to filter out the orders of your choice from all of the Neckermann orders that you received and to open the corresponding invoices in a separate file. With the help of the search filter in this area, you can determine which criteria should be used to select orders for the retrieval of invoices.
