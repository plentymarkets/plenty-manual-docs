[#data-exchange]
== Frequency of data exchange

After setting up {market} in plentymarkets, the automatic processes described below are available. +
Depending on whether you export data using catalogues or the old export, data are transferred to Kaufland in different intervals.

[#data-exchange-catalogue]
=== Data exchange when exporting data via catalogues

If you export data to Kaufland using catalogues, then data are exchanged with Kaufland in the intervals described in <<#data-exchange-catalogue>>:

* Customers place an order on Kaufland.
* Customers make their payments to Kaufland.
* The order is imported into plentymarkets right after it was placed on Kaufland.

*_Notes on the Kaufland order import:_*

* Orders with the Kaufland status *OPEN* are imported into plentymarkets without address details and with the status *[1] Incomplete data*. These are orders that can still be cancelled by the customer. The orders remain in this status for 15 minutes so that customers still have the possibility to cancel the order. +

[TIP]
.Reserve stock for orders with the payment method cash in advance
====
*_Important:_* No stock is reserved for orders in status *[1] Invalid data* by default. To make sure that stock is reserved for these orders, go to *Setup » Orders » Settings*. Go to the setting *Status for order reservation (Reservation of stocks)*. For the option *to*, select the status *[1] Incomplete data*. In the drop-down list to the far right, select the option *All orders*.
====

* When the order status on Kaufland changes after 15 minutes, the order automatically moves to status *[5] Cleared for shipping* in plentymarkets. All missing order data is added to the order.

* <<#kaufland-fbk, Orders that are processed by Kaufland (FbK = Fulfillment by Kaufland)>> are imported into plentymarkets with the order referrer *170.01 Kaufland FBK DE*.

|Setting |Explanation

2+^| *General*

| *Shop name* +
(mandatory)
| Enter the name of your Kaufland shop. +
*_Note:_* This name is only shown in your plentymarkets system and not exported to Kaufland. As such, the shop name’s purpose is to help you better keep track of the list of configurations in the *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » New settings (Test phase)* menu.

| *Data exchange*
| Activate to exchange data with Kaufland.

| *Client API Key* +
(mandatory)
| Enter the client API key. You will receive the key from Kaufland.

| *Client (store)*
| Select the plentyShop that you want to use for this configuration from the drop-down list.

| *Book incoming payment*
| *Yes* = All orders are imported as *paid*. +
*No* = All orders are imported as *not paid*. +

Regardless of this setting, items will immediately be cleared for shipping when they have sufficient stock.

| *Match shipping service providers*
| Match your shipping service providers in plentymarkets with the shipping service providers from Kaufland in the drop-down list. +

After the shipment has been confirmed, this option allows Kaufland.de to use the package number in order to send the customer an email with the correct tracking link. +

*_Important:_* You have to assign each of your service providers to one of the service providers from the drop-down list.

*_Note:_* Click on (icon:open_in_new[]) to set up new shipping service providers in plentymarkets. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping service providers*.

| *Status for orders with failed shipping confirmations*
| Select a status. If no shipping confirmation could be sent to Kaufland.de, the order is moved to this status. If necessary, create a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#create-status[new status]. +

*_Background:_* The event procedure <<#shipping-confirmation, Send shipping confirmation to Kaufland.de>> automatically informs {market} that the items of an order have been shipped. If the event procedure cannot be completed, the order is moved to the status that you selected for the setting *Status for orders with failed shipping confirmations*.

2+^| *Item settings*

| *Item export*
| Activate to export items to Kaufland. +

*_Note:_* You can *deactivate* this setting if you export your items to Kaufland using <<#catalogue-export, catalogues>>. +
However, make sure that all of the variations which you want to offer on Kaufland are <<#link-variations-to-product-category, mapped in a Kaufland catalogue>> before you deactivate this setting. If a variation is not mapped in a Kaufland catalogue, then it will not be exported to Kaufland.

| *Export only items with flags*
a| * *all items* = All items are exported.
* *all items with flag 1* or *2* = Only items with this flag are exported. +
* *all items without flag 1* or *2* = Only items without this flag are exported. +
* Select one particular flag = Only items with the selected flag are exported. +
This setting applies to item data and order data.

| *Image position (ID) of the energy efficiency label*
| Enter the ID of the image for the energy efficiency label. You can find the ID in the *Images* tab of an item. +

Every image that should be transferred as an energy efficiency label must have this position (ID). +

*_Note:_* The ID must be an integer.

| *Add technical data to the item description*
| Activate this setting if the technical data that is entered in the *Technical data* area within the *Texts* tab of an item should be added to the item description on Kaufland. +
This setting is *activated* by default.

2+^| *Offer settings*

| *Offer update*
a| Activate if offers should be transferred to and updated on Kaufland. Offers are updated once per hour and once per day at Kaufland. +
Only if both this setting and the setting *Data exchange* are activated, the daily complete offer update and the hourly update for offers that were changed is carried out. +

*_Note:_* You can *deactivate* this setting if you export your items to Kaufland using <<#catalogue-export, catalogues>>. +

However, make sure that all of the variations which you want to offer on Kaufland are <<#link-variations-to-product-category, mapped in a Kaufland catalogue>> before you deactivate this setting. If a variation is not mapped in a Kaufland catalogue, then it will not be exported to Kaufland.

| *Inventory cache*
| Activate if stock data should be saved within the cache on a daily basis. +

*_Note:_* We recommend to activate this setting because vast changes to stock data can result in errors.

| *Max. quantity for items with no stock limit*
| Enter an integer. Items for which *No limitation* has been selected in the *Settings* tab in the *Availability* area of an item are offered on Kaufland with the quantity entered here. This means that a maximum of the number entered here can be bought of this item on Kaufland at once. +

As soon as an item has been sold, the quantity saved here is newly transferred for sale at the next full hour.

| *Minimum price*
| Select a sales price for the minimum price to set up repricing (Tiefpreisautomatik) for Kaufland. +

If other sellers offer the same product, your price is automatically reduced. Your price plus shipping is then always one cent cheaper than the prices of your competitors. As such, the minimum price is the lowest price that can be used to undercut the competition. +

*_Note:_* For the minimum price, select a different price than the normal sales price that you set for Kaufland. The referrer Kaufland.de must be activated for the sales price that you select as the minimum price. +

Activate the repricing by linking the sales price that you selected as the minimum price with the variation and entering the lowest possible price. +

*_Important:_* The minimum price does not apply to item variations which have surcharges for attributes. In this case, *deactivate* this option. If you would like to use the minimum price, then create each variation as a separate item with a defined minimum price.

| *Text for item comment*
| Select which text should be displayed with your items on Kaufland. The selected text is displayed with every offer on Kaufland. +

You can select free text fields or set up the field *Item comment for every offer* for this function.

| *Item comment for every offer*
| Enter text. The entered text is displayed with every offer on Kaufland if you select the option *Item comment for every offer* for the *Text for item comment* setting. +

For example, if all of your items are handmade, you could enter the text “handmade” as comment. This text will then be shown with every offer on Kaufland.

| *Match shipping profiles*
| Match your shipping profiles in plentymarkets with shipping groups from Kaufland. +

First, click on *Update shipping groups* (icon:refresh[]) so that the latest Kaufland shipping groups are available in the drop-down list. +
*_Important:_* If you change the shipping groups on Kaufland, then you can update them in plentymarkets by clicking on *Update shipping groups*. +
*_Note:_* The page will be refreshed if you update the Kaufland shipping groups. All unsaved changes will be lost. Therefore, the settings are automatically saved before the Kaufland shipping groups are updated. +

If an item has more than one shipping profile, the shipping profile with the lowest category and the highest priority is exported. The category and the priority of a shipping profile are configured within *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping profiles* in the *Base* tab of each shipping profile.

| *Match warehouses*
a| Warehouses located outside the EU have to be linked with a Kaufland warehouse. Use the setting *Match warehouses* for this. Here, all of your plentymarkets warehouses of the type *Sales* are listed. Select your warehouses and link each of them to the correspondent Kaufland warehouse. This way, the stock of your warehouses is linked to the Kaufland warehouses. +
*_Note:_* This setting is not relevant if your warehouses are within the EU. +

* *–* = The warehouse is linked to the Kaufland default warehouse.
* *Do not export* = The stock of this warehouse is not transmitted to Kaufland.

| *Export item availabilities*
| Activate if item availabilities should be transferred to Kaufland.

| *Match item availabilities*
a| Click on *Open matching table* (icon:swap_horiz[]) to match the item availabilities in plentymarkets with delivery times in working days. +

Enter the handling time in working days into the *Handling time (in working days)* field that matches the plentymarkets item availability. +
If you do not enter a value for *Handling time*, then the value which is entered into *Minimum delivery time (in working days)* will be transferred as handling time.

*_Note:_* Kaufland specifies Monday to Friday as working days. +

The plentymarkets availability IDs 1-10 correspond to the item availabilities defined in the *Setup » Item » Availability* menu.

*_Note:_* The fields *Minimum delivery time (in working days)* and *Maximum delivery time (in working days)* are deprecated and will be removed from the menu. This means that you do not have to enter anything into these fields. However, make sure to enter values into the *Handling time (in working days)* fields.

[#225]
=== Deemed Supplier Model

On 01/07/2021, the new EU Digital Package came into force. This package results in changes to the regulations regarding VAT in EU countries. Due to these legal changes, Kaufland.de becomes a deemed supplier and is thus partially liable for VAT. Kaufland.de has reacted to this by introducing the *Deemed Supplier* model. The model is based on the location of the company, the location of warehouses and the value of a delivery. As such, the model is relevant for the following types of deliveries:

* Deliveries sent from a location in the EU to a customer in the EU, even if the seller is not located in the EU.
* Deliveries sent from a location outside the EU to a customer in the EU if the value of the delivery does not exceed € 150.

Some special rules for order processing and invoice creation apply for orders covered by the Deemed Supplier model:

* During the import of Kaufland.de orders to your plentymarkets system, an automatic check determines if these orders are covered by the Deemed Supplier model. Information about these orders are provided to you by Kaufland.de via the seller portal, CSV reports and via the API.
* In cases where not all order items of an order are subject to the model, the order is split. Both orders get an individual order ID and are simultaneously imported into your plentymarkets system. This ensures that the handling of individual orders and order items can proceed correctly.

*_Important_*: Kaufland.de is obliged to withhold and pay VAT for Deemed Supplier orders. As such, Kaufland.de issues invoices for these orders. As a result, you cannot create invoices for these orders.

Also note the required xref:markets:kaufland-setup.adoc#intable-linking-warehouse[warehouse settings] for warehouses outside of the EU. If items are delivered from outside the EU, the corresponding warehouses have to be linked to Kaufland.de warehouses. You do this via the setting *Linking warehouses* in the *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Settings* menu.

[TIP]
.Pay attention to warehouse linking for Kaufland.de
====
When updating offers, pay attention to linked warehouses for Kaufland.de. +
It is not possible to assign more than one Kaufland.de warehouse to an offer on Kaufland.de. If the warehouses of a variation in plentymarkets are assigned to different warehouses on Kaufland.de, only the stock of one of those plentymarkets warehouses will be exported to Kaufland.de. Ideally, you should assign the warehouses of one variation in plentymarkets to the same warehouse on Kaufland.de. Then the sum of all plentymarkets warehouses will be shown on Kaufland.de. +
Link warehouses with the option *Link warehouses* in the menu *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Settings » [Select client]*.

The referrers *102.01 Kaufland DE*, *102.02 Kaufland CZ*, and *102.03 Kaufland SK* are currently without function and therefore, they must be deactivated. If these referrers are activated, this can result in errors during the stock and price updates.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not group Kaufland.de orders
====
During the order import, Kaufland.de orders are synchronised by the external order number. However, in grouped orders, the external order number no longer exists. As such, grouping orders might result in orders being created anew when they are retrieved again.

=== _Beta:_ Fulfillment by Kaufland (FbK): Using the FbK service

Kaufland offers the service FbK (= Fulfillment by Kaufland). With this service, Kaufland takes care of the storage and ships your items. If you want to use FbK, get in touch with your contact person at Kaufland. However, note that Kaufland FbK is currently in the beta phase. Kaufland continues to develop this feature. +

Currently, you cannot carry out any settings for FbK in your plentymarkets system. Kaufland FbK orders are only imported into plentymarkets. Items that you want to sell via FbK have to be created in the Kaufland Seller Portal. FbK orders can be retrieved, but not processed in plentymarkets.

Workflow of an FbK order:

* Your items are listed on Kaufland. The name of your company is shown with your items.
* Customers place an order on Kaufland.
* Customers make their payments to Kaufland.
* Kaufland ships the order.
* FbK orders are imported into plentymarkets with the order referrer *170.01 Kaufland FBK DE*.

[#link-variations-to-product-category]
=== Linking variations to a Kaufland product category

*_Note:_* You only have to link your variations to Kaufland product categories if you use the <<#catalogue-export, catalogue export>> to transfer items to Kaufland.

After you created a catalogue format for Kaufland with the assistant *Kaufland - Creating catalogues*, the property *Kaufland.de category* is created in your plentymarkets system. With this property, you define in which category your variations are offered on Kaufland.

In the assistant *Kaufland - Creating catalogues*, you select a Kaufland product category for each catalogue that you create. Each of these product categories is added as a selection value to the property *Kaufland.de category*.

In order for your variations to be offered in the desired category on Kaufland, they have to be linked to the *Kaufland.de category* property in the *Properties* tab of the variation. Afterwards, select the product category in which your variations should be offered as selection value for this property.

[.instruction]
Linking a variation to a product category:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Variation properties* area, select the property *Kaufland.de category* from the *Properties* drop-down list and click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is added.
. Select a category from the drop-down list *Value* for the property *Kaufland.de category*. +
→ The variation will be exported in this catalogue. +
*_Example:_* If you select the value *T-Shirts*, then the variation will be offered in the product category *T-Shirts* on Kaufland.
. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all categories where you want to offer the variation.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

=== Linking categories

Link your plentymarkets categories to the Kaufland.de categories in order to display your items in these categories. Further items from the linked category are assigned automatically.

[.instruction]
Linking categories:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Category link*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The *Select category* window opens.

[IMPORTANT]
.Subcategories do not have to be linked
====
In some cases, your subcategories may not match the Kaufland.de subcategories. In such cases, link your items with Kaufland.de's corresponding main category. Kaufland.de automatically assigns your items to a subcategory. You should not transfer items to Kaufland.de that have not been assigned to a Kaufland.de category.

==== Linking plentymarkets characteristics with Kaufland.de attributes

It is possible to overwrite attributes with plentymarkets characteristics or to add Kaufland.de attributes. +
*_Important:_* In order for the plentymarkets characteristics to be correctly assigned during the Kaufland.de export, the internal name of the plentymarkets characteristic must be the same as the column header in the Kaufland.de Product.csv file. +
The Kaufland.de attributes EAN, title, description, manufacturer and picture are mandatory entries for the item export. These attributes are transferred by plentymarkets by default. These attributes can only be overwritten by an attribute. Other attributes, such as "material_composition", "clothing_size" or "weight" can be added if a corresponding characteristic is created in plentymarkets.

[WARNING]
.Mandatory entries for the item export
====
The Kaufland.de attributes *ean*, *title*, *description*, *manufacturer* and *picture* are mandatory entries for the item export.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a characteristic:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic* tab.
. Enter the name of the Kaufland.de attribute into the *Name (internal)* field. +
→ The entered name is displayed in the item data record when linking characteristics.
. Enter a name in the *Webshop* field.  +
→ This name is used in the item overview of the plentyShop.
. Select the *Characteristic type*.
. Activate the option *Kaufland.de*.

[#catalogue-export]
=== _Alternative 2:_ Catalogue export _(recommended)_

Catalogue formats provide you with a long-term and flexible way to export your item data. Item data is exported to Kaufland using a catalogue. +
Kaufland catalogues are created with the *Kaufland - Creating catalogues* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

[#create-catalogue]
==== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to Kaufland via a catalogue. Kaufland catalogues are created with the *Kaufland - Creating catalogues* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu. Afterwards, link the Kaufland data fields with item data saved in plentymarkets in the catalogue you created. +
After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to {market} once a day.

There is a separate catalogue format for each Kaufland product category. Different item data is exported in the different catalogue formats, depending on which information Kaufland requires for each product category. For example, different item data has to be mapped in the catalogues for *TVs* and *Cameras*. +
This means that you have to create a separate catalogue for each Kaufland product category that you want to sell your items in.

[IMPORTANT]
.Create catalogues in the assistant
====
At present, you can only create Kaufland catalogues with the assistant *Kaufland - Creating catalogues* and _not_ in the *Data » Catalogues* menu.

| Select the Kaufland account that you want to use with this catalogue.
| Select the Kaufland account that you want to create a catalogue for.

| Select a Kaufland country platform on which you want to offer your items. Select a Kaufland product category afterwards. You have to create a separate catalogue for every Kaufland product category in which you want to offer your items.
| Here you select the Kaufland country platform and the Kaufland product category that you want to create a catalogue for. You define which items you want to sell in this country in the selected product category. You can export different item data to different country platforms. +
The different country platforms are displayed as country codes, for example *DE* for *Germany*. At Kaufland, country platforms are called storefronts. +
*_Note:_* At present, only the country platform *Deutschland (DE)* is available. +
You have to create a separate catalogue for each Kaufland product category that you want to offer your items in. +
For example, you create different catalogues for the product categories *TVs* and *Cameras*.

| Enter a name for this catalogue. The name is shown in the *Data » Catalogues* menu and is not exported to Kaufland.
| Here you enter an internal name for the Kaufland catalogue. This name is only visible in the *Data » Catalogues* menu in your plentymarkets system and serves a better overview of your catalogues. The name of the catalogue is not exported to Kaufland. +
Select a meaningful name that helps you keep track of your catalogues. For example, if you create a catalogue for the product category *TVs* and the platform *Germany*, you might call the catalogue *Kaufland: TVs (Germany)*.

[#data-field-mappings]
==== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. This chapter describes how you map data fields and what particularities apply for item exports to {market}.

[TIP]
.Map your own data fields
====
You want to transfer item data to Kaufland that do not have a designated data field in the market’s catalogue? In the Kaufland catalogues, you have the possibility to create own data fields and assign them to item data saved in plentymarkets. How to map your own data fields is described <<#assigning-own-data-fields, here>>.

[#particularities-kaufland-catalogues]
==== Notes on mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. As such, there are some particularities for each market when mapping data fields. This chapter contains mapping information for important data fields for Kaufland.

[#stock-buffer]
===== Stock buffer

In the catalogues for Kaufland, you can use a *stock buffer*. A stock buffer is the amount of an item that should not be sold, but kept as a buffer. +

In order to use a stock buffer for Kaufland, map the data field *Stock buffer* in your Kaufland catalogues. The stock buffer is applied when the stock is updated and when a new offer is created.

Recommended mappings for the data field *Stock buffer*:

 * *Own value*: Enter a value that should be used as stock buffer. For example, if you enter the value *5* here, then the stock for Kaufland is reduced by 5 items which are kept as a buffer.

_or_

 * Property linked to variation, type *Text* or *whole number*

[#size-unit-kaufland]
===== Specifying the size unit as own value for Length, Width, and Height

In many Kaufland catalogues, the data fields *Length*, *Width*, and *Height* are mandatory and have to be mapped. We recommend the following mappings for these data fields:

* *Length*: *Variation » Length*, _specify size unit_
* *Width*: *Variation » Width*, _specify size unit_
* *Height*: *Variation » Height*, _specify size unit_

For these data fields, only the value is transferred to Kaufland. The size unit is not transferred to Kaufland. However, in order for your variations to be correctly exported to Kaufland, you have to specify the size unit. You should therefore additionally specify the size unit as an *own value*. +
An example of how to specify the size unit as own value for the data field *Length* is provided below.

[.instruction]
Specifying the size unit as own value:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*.
. Open the Kaufland catalogue.
. Map the Kaufland data field *Length* with the value *Variation » Length*.
. Click on *Add data field* (material:insert_link[]). +
→ Another data field is added.
. Enter the size unit in the data field *Own value*. +
→ For example, you can enter *mm*, *cm*, or *m*, depending on which size unit you want to transfer.
. Click on the *Settings* (material:settings[]) for this data field. +
→ The window *Data column settings* opens. Here you can configure the separator.
. Select *Null* as *Fallback condition*.
. Select *Space* as *Separator*.
. *Save* the settings.
. Repeat the steps above for the data fields *Width* and *Height*.

[#activate-catalogue]
==== Activating the catalogue export

[IMPORTANT]
.Items will only be exported once the catalogue has been activated
====
Items will only be exported to Kaufland after the catalogue has been activated in the *Data » Catalogues* menu. +
If you have not created a catalogue for a Kaufland product category, then items of this category will be exported to Kaufland via the old item export.
====

=== Hiding bank details on invoices

The payment is processed by Kaufland.de. To prevent customers from paying money directly to you, do not show any bank details on invoices for Kaufland.de. +

How you hide bank details on {market} invoices depends on how your bank details are shown on invoices:

* _If your bank details are saved in the menu *Setup » Client » Standard » Locations » Germany (standard) » Documents » Invoice » Tab: PDF template » Option: Payment instruction*:_
  ** No additional settings are necessary to make sure that your bank details are not shown on Kaufland.de invoices.

* _If you show your bank details directly on the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#1700[PDF template] for invoice documents:_
  ** Create an additional PDF template for Kaufland.de that does not contain any bank details.

This chapter contains answers to frequently asked questions.

[#no-shipping-confirmation]
[.collapseBox]
.No shipping confirmation was sent. What now?
--

The event procedure <<#shipping-confirmation, Send shipping confirmation to Kaufland.de>> automatically informs {market} that the items of an order have shipped. If the event procedure cannot be completed, the order is moved to the status that you selected for the setting *Order status for orders with failed shipping confirmations*.

Check orders in this status:

* Is the shipping service provider linked correctly?
* Is a tracking number saved for the order?

After correcting the order, move the order to the status that triggers the event procedure <<#shipping-confirmation, Send shipping confirmation to Kaufland.de>>.
