| *Minimum price*
| Select a sales price for the minimum price to set up repricing (Tiefpreisautomatik) for Kaufland.de. +
If other sellers offer the same product, your price is automatically reduced. Your price plus shipping is then always once cent cheaper than the prices of your competitors. As such, the minimum price is the lowest price that can be used to undercut the competition. +
*_Note:_* For the minimum price, select a different price from the normal sales price that you <<#400, set for Kaufland.de>>. The referrer Kaufland.de must be activated for the sales price that you select as the minimum price. +
Activate the repricing by linking the sales price that you selected as the minimum price with the variation and entering the lowest possible price. +
*_Important:_* The minimum price does not apply to item variations which have surcharges for attributes. In this case, *deactivate* this option. If you would like to use the minimum price, then create each variation as a separate item with a defined minimum price.

Select your warehouses and link each of them to the correspondent Kaufland.de warehouse. This way, the stock of your warehouses is linked to the Kaufland.de warehouses. This setting is not relevant if your warehouses are within the EU. +
*–* = The warehouse is linked to the Kaufland.de default warehouse. +
*Do not export* = The stock of this warehouse is not transmitted to Kaufland.de.

[#225]
=== Deemed Supplier Model

On 01/07/2021, the new EU Digital Package came into force. This package results in changes to the regulations regarding VAT in EU countries. Due to these legal changes, Kaufland.de becomes a deemed supplier and is thus partially liable for VAT. Kaufland.de has reacted to this by introducing the *Deemed Supplier* model. The model is based on the location of the company, the location of warehouses and the value of a delivery. As such, the model is relevant for the following types of deliveries:

* Deliveries sent from a location in the EU to a customer in the EU, even if the seller is not located in the EU.
* Deliveries sent from a location outside the EU to a customer in the EU if the value of the delivery does not exceed € 150.

Some special rules for order processing and invoice creation apply for orders covered by the Deemed Supplier model:

* During the import of Kaufland.de orders to your plentymarkets system, an automatic check determines if these orders are covered by the Deemed Supplier model. Information about these orders are provided to you by Kaufland.de via the seller portal, CSV reports and via the API.
* In cases where not all order items of an order are subject to the model, the order is split. Both orders get an individual order ID and are simultaneously imported into your plentymarkets system. This ensures that the handling of individual orders and order items can proceed correctly.

*_Important_*: Kaufland.de is obliged to withhold and pay VAT for Deemed Supplier orders. As such, Kaufland.de issues invoices for these orders. As a result, you cannot create invoices for these orders.

Also note the required xref:markets:kaufland-setup.adoc#intable-linking-warehouse[warehouse settings] for warehouses outside of the EU. If items are delivered from outside the EU, the corresponding warehouses have to be linked to Kaufland.de warehouses. You do this via the setting *Linking warehouses* in the *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Settings* menu.

[TIP]
.Pay attention to warehouse linking for Kaufland.de
====
When updating offers, pay attention to linked warehouses for Kaufland.de. +
It is not possible to assign more than one Kaufland.de warehouse to an offer on Kaufland.de. If the warehouses of a variation in plentymarkets are assigned to different warehouses on Kaufland.de, only the stock of one of those plentymarkets warehouses will be exported to Kaufland.de. Ideally, you should assign the warehouses of one variation in plentymarkets to the same warehouse on Kaufland.de. Then the sum of all plentymarkets warehouses will be shown on Kaufland.de. +
Warehouses can be linked with the *Linking warehouses* setting in the  *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Settings » [Select client]* menu.

include::partial$activate-referrer.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not group Kaufland.de orders
====
During the order import, Kaufland.de orders are synchronised by the external order number. However, because the external order number does not exist any longer in a grouped order, grouping orders might result in orders being created anew when they are retrieved again.

== Defining the barcode

Proceed as described below to define a barcode for the order referrer Kaufland.de. This barcode is transferred to Kaufland.de for the variation.

[.instruction]
Defining a barcode for Kaufland.de:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Barcode*.

== Preparing variations

Kaufland.de specifies some mandatory information. That means that a variation only can be exported to the market if this mandatory information is saved for the variation. For a functioning export to Kaufland.de, the variation has to conform with the following requirements:

* A *EAN* or an *ISBN*

If the information listed above is not saved, the variation is not exported.

[#500]
== Activating characteristics for the market

:market: Kaufland.de
:characteristic-option: Kaufland.de

include::partial$activate-characteristic.adoc[]

[#550]
=== Linking plentymarkets characteristics with Kaufland.de attributes

It is possible to overwrite attributes with plentymarkets characteristics or to add Kaufland.de attributes. +
*_Important:_* In order for the plentymarkets characteristics to be correctly assigned during the Kaufland.de export, the internal name of the plentymarkets characteristic must be the same as the column header in the Kaufland.de Product.csv file. +
The Kaufland.de attributes EAN, title, description, manufacturer and picture are mandatory entries for the item export. These attributes are transferred by plentymarkets by default. These attributes can only be overwritten by an attribute. Other attributes, such as "material_composition", "clothing_size" or "weight" can be added if a corresponding characteristic is created in plentymarkets.

[WARNING]
.Mandatory entries for the item export
====
The Kaufland.de attributes *ean*, *title*, *description*, *manufacturer* and *picture* are mandatory entries for the item export.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a characteristic:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic* tab.
. Enter the name of the Kaufland.de attribute into the *Name (internal)* field. +
→ The entered name is displayed in the item data record when linking characteristics.
. Enter a name in the *Webshop* field.  +
→ This name is used in the item overview of the plentyShop.
. Select the *Characteristic type*.
. Activate the option *Kaufland.de*.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

For further information about linking characteristics with Kaufland.de, refer to the xref:markets:best-practices-kaufland-linking-characteristics.adoc#[Linking characteristics to attributes] best practice page.

[#600]
== Linking categories

Link your plentymarkets categories to the Kaufland.de categories in order to display your items in these categories. Further items from the linked category are assigned automatically.

[.instruction]
Linking categories:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Category link*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The *Select category* window opens.
. Select the Kaufland.de category that best matches your plentymarkets category.
. Click on *Apply*. +
→ The ID and category path of the Kaufland.de category are displayed.
. If you already know the ID of the Kaufland.de category, enter it directly into the *Market category field* to link it to your plentymarkets category.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Subcategories do not have to be linked
====
In some cases, your subcategories may not match the Kaufland.de subcategories. In such cases, link your items with Kaufland.de's corresponding main category. Kaufland.de automatically assigns your items to a subcategory. You should not transfer items to Kaufland.de that have not been assigned to a Kaufland.de category.
