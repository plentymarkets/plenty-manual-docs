|===
|Setting |Explanation

| *Display name of configuration*
| Enter a meaningful name for this combination of a client (store)/plentyShop and a Kaufland account. If you do not enter a display name, the name `Default configuration` is saved. +
*_Tip:_* The display name is only used for the list of configurations. As such, the display name’s purpose is to help you better keep track of the list of configurations in the *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Settings » [Open client]* menu.

image::markets:kaufland-display-name.png[]

| *Activate interface to Kaufland.de*
a| * *Yes* = Activate the interface to Kaufland.de. Data is exchanged with Kaufland.
* *No* = Do not activate the interface to Kaufland.de. No data is exchanged with Kaufland.

2+^| API data

| *Client Key*
|Enter the client key that you received from Kaufland.de.

| *Secret Key*
|Enter the secret key that you received from Kaufland.de.

2+^| Order settings

| *Use configuration for legacy orders*
| This setting is *activated* by default for your previous Kaufland account. This is to make sure that old orders which were generated on Kaufland before the link:https://forum.plentymarkets.com/t/mehrere-konten-fuer-kaufland-einrichten-set-up-several-accounts-for-kaufland/681351[update^] can be properly processed in your plentymarkets system. +
Your previous Kaufland account is listed in the *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Settings » Tab: Accounts* menu. +
This setting is not relevant for new Kaufland accounts which can be added in the *New account* tab. The setting is therefore *deactivated* by default in a new configuration.

| *Book incoming payment*
| This setting applies to the order import. Orders are imported either as paid or not paid. Regardless of this setting, items will immediately be cleared for shipping when they have sufficient stock. With the option *open*, you could also set the order to paid when the actual incoming payment from Kaufland.de is received. In this way, Kaufland.de can be tested.

| *Match shipping service providers*
| After the shipment has been confirmed, this option allows Kaufland.de to use the package number in order to send the customer an email with the correct tracking link. +
*_Important:_* You have to assign each of your service providers to one of the service providers from the drop-down list.

| *Order status for orders with failed shipping confirmations*
| Select a status. If no shipping confirmation could be sent to Kaufland.de, the order is moved to this status. If necessary, create a xref:orders:managing-orders.adoc#1230[new status].

*_Background:_* The event procedure <<#shipping-confirmation, Send shipping confirmation to Kaufland.de>> automatically informs {market} that the items of an order have shipped. If the event procedure cannot be completed, the order is moved to the status that you selected for the setting *Order status for orders with failed shipping confirmations*.

//| *Order status for orders with failed in fulfilment confirmations*
//| Select a status. If no in fulfilment confirmation could be sent to Kaufland.de, the order is moved to this status.

//*_Background:_* The event procedure <<#in-fulfillment, Send in fulfilment confirmation to Kaufland.de>> automatically informs {market} that an order has been handed over to the warehouse for fulfilment. If the event procedure cannot be completed, the order is moved to the status that you selected for the setting *Order status for orders with failed in fulfilment confirmations*.

2+^| Item settings

| *Activate item export*
|Select whether the item export to Kaufland.de should be activated.

| *Export only items with flags*
a| * *All items* = All items are exported.
* *All items with flag 1* or *2* = Only items with this flag are exported. +
* *All items without flag 1* or *2* = Only items without this flag are exported. +
* Select one particular flag = Only items with this flag are exported. +
This setting applies to item data and order data.

| *Image position of the energy efficiency label*
|Enter the position of the energy efficiency label. Every image that should be transferred as an energy efficiency label must have this position.

| *Add technical data to the item description*
|Select whether the technical data saved in the *Texts* tab of an item should be added to the item description for Kaufland.de. *Yes* is selected by default.

| *Generate item file*
|This option creates an item file. This file can be viewed via *Item file preview*.

| *Item file preview*
|Display the item file preview. +
*_Note:_* If you have not fully set up the interface to Kaufland.de but want to take a look at the item file preview, then you have to activate the interface temporarily. Otherwise, the item file preview will be empty. In order to view the item file preview when the interface is not active, activate the interface and click on *Item file preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]). Deactivate the interface immediately afterwards by selecting the option *No* for the *Activate interface to Kaufland.de* setting and saving the setting. This way, you can prevent items from being transferred too soon.

| *Send item file to Kaufland.de*
|Send the item file to Kaufland.de.

2+^| Offer settings

| *Activate offer update*
a| * *Yes* (default setting) = Offers are updated once per hour and once per day at Kaufland.de. Only if both this option and the option *Activate interface to Kaufland.de* are activated, the daily complete offer update and the hourly update for offers that were changed is executed. +
* *No* = The offer update is deactivated.

| *Generate cache file (Inventory)*
a| Select *Yes* or *No*. +

* *Yes* = Stock is saved in the cache on a daily basis.  +
* *No* = Stock is not saved in the cache. +

*_Note:_* We recommend using the option *Yes* because bigger stock changes may result in errors.

| *Item quantity for items that are not limited to stock*
|Items for which *no limitation* has been selected in the tab xref:stock-management:managing-stocks.adoc#[Stock] of an item are offered on Kaufland.de with the quantity entered here. As soon as an item has been sold, the quantity saved here is newly transmitted for sale at the next full hour.

| *Minimum price*
| Select a sales price for the minimum price to set up repricing (Tiefpreisautomatik) for Kaufland.de. +
If other sellers offer the same product, your price is automatically reduced. Your price plus shipping is then always once cent cheaper than the prices of your competitors. As such, the minimum price is the lowest price that can be used to undercut the competition. +
*_Note:_* For the minimum price, select a different price from the normal sales price that you <<#400, set for Kaufland.de>>. The referrer Kaufland.de must be activated for the sales price that you select as the minimum price. +
Activate the repricing by linking the sales price that you selected as the minimum price with the variation and entering the lowest possible price. +
*_Important:_* The minimum price does not apply to item variations which have surcharges for attributes. In this case, *deactivate* this option. If you would like to use the minimum price, then create each variation as a separate item with a defined minimum price.

| *Comments on items*
| Set up *free text fields* for item comments here or assign this function to the *Global item comment* field.

| *Global item comment*
|Enter text. The entered text is displayed with every offer.

| *Linking shipping profiles*
|This option enables you to link the Kaufland.de shipping groups to the plentymarkets shipping profiles. If an item has more than one shipping profile, the shipping profile with the lowest category and the highest priority is exported. The category and the priority of a shipping profile are configured within *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping profiles* in the *Base* tab of each shipping profile. +
*_Important:_* If the shipping groups are changed on Kaufland.de, you can update them by clicking on *Update shipping groups*.

|[#intable-linking-warehouse]*Linking warehouses*
| Warehouses located outside the EU have to be linked with a Kaufland.de warehouse. Use the setting *Linking warehouses* for this. Here, all of your warehouses of the type *Sales* are listed. Select your warehouses and link each of them to the correspondent Kaufland.de warehouse. This way, the stock of your warehouses is linked to the Kaufland.de warehouses. This setting is not relevant if your warehouses are within the EU. +
*–* = The warehouse is linked to the Kaufland.de default warehouse. +
*Do not export* = The stock of this warehouse is not transmitted to Kaufland.de.

| *Export item availabilities*
|Select whether item availabilities should be transferred to Kaufland.de.

| *Match item availabilities*
|Match plentymarkets item availabilities with a minimum and maximum delivery time in working days. +
Enter the minimum and maximum delivery time in working days into the *Minimum delivery time (in working days)* and *Maximum delivery time (in working days)* fields that match the plentymarkets item availability. +
*_Note:_* Kaufland specifies Monday to Friday as working days. +
The plentymarkets availability IDs 1-10 correspond to the item availabilities defined in the *Setup » Item » Availability* menu.

| *Generate offer file*
|This option creates an offer file. This file can be viewed via *Preview offer file*.

| *Preview offer file*
|Display the offer file preview.

[#225]
=== Deemed Supplier Model

On 01/07/2021, the new EU Digital Package came into force. This package results in changes to the regulations regarding VAT in EU countries. Due to these legal changes, Kaufland.de becomes a deemed supplier and is thus partially liable for VAT. Kaufland.de has reacted to this by introducing the *Deemed Supplier* model. The model is based on the location of the company, the location of warehouses and the value of a delivery. As such, the model is relevant for the following types of deliveries:

* Deliveries sent from a location in the EU to a customer in the EU, even if the seller is not located in the EU.
* Deliveries sent from a location outside the EU to a customer in the EU if the value of the delivery does not exceed € 150.

Some special rules for order processing and invoice creation apply for orders covered by the Deemed Supplier model:

* During the import of Kaufland.de orders to your plentymarkets system, an automatic check determines if these orders are covered by the Deemed Supplier model. Information about these orders are provided to you by Kaufland.de via the seller portal, CSV reports and via the API.
* In cases where not all order items of an order are subject to the model, the order is split. Both orders get an individual order ID and are simultaneously imported into your plentymarkets system. This ensures that the handling of individual orders and order items can proceed correctly.

*_Important_*: Kaufland.de is obliged to withhold and pay VAT for Deemed Supplier orders. As such, Kaufland.de issues invoices for these orders. As a result, you cannot create invoices for these orders.

Also note the required xref:markets:kaufland-setup.adoc#intable-linking-warehouse[warehouse settings] for warehouses outside of the EU. If items are delivered from outside the EU, the corresponding warehouses have to be linked to Kaufland.de warehouses. You do this via the setting *Linking warehouses* in the *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Settings* menu.

[TIP]
.Pay attention to warehouse linking for Kaufland.de
====
When updating offers, pay attention to linked warehouses for Kaufland.de. +
It is not possible to assign more than one Kaufland.de warehouse to an offer on Kaufland.de. If the warehouses of a variation in plentymarkets are assigned to different warehouses on Kaufland.de, only the stock of one of those plentymarkets warehouses will be exported to Kaufland.de. Ideally, you should assign the warehouses of one variation in plentymarkets to the same warehouse on Kaufland.de. Then the sum of all plentymarkets warehouses will be shown on Kaufland.de. +
Link warehouses with the option *Link warehouses* in the menu *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Settings » [Select client]*.

=== Activating the order referrer

:market: Kaufland.de
:referrer: Kaufland.de
:referrer-option: pass:quotes[option *Kaufland.de* with ID *170*]

include::partial$activate-referrer.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not activate subordinate Kaufland referrers
====
The referrers *102.01 Kaufland DE*, *102.02 Kaufland CZ*, and *102.03 Kaufland SK* are currently without function and therefore, they must be deactivated. If these referrers are activated, this can result in errors during the stock and price updates.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Do not group Kaufland.de orders
====
During the order import, Kaufland.de orders are synchronised by the external order number. However, in grouped orders, the external order number no longer exists. As such, grouping orders might result in orders being created anew when they are retrieved again.

[#mandatory-fields]
=== Pflichtangaben an Varianten speichern

{market} requires some mandatory information. As a result, variations can only be exported to the market if this mandatory information is saved for the variation. For a functioning export to {market}, the variation has to conform with the following requirements:

* A *EAN* or an *ISBN*

If the information listed above is not saved, the variation is not exported.
////

[#save-barcode]
=== Saving variation barcodes

Variations must have a barcode that is activated for {market}. This is why you <<#450, defined a barcode for {market} earlier>>. If this barcode is not linked to all variations for {market}, now is the time to link the barcode to these variations. Save one barcode code for each variation.

[.instruction]
Saving a barcode:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Search for and open the variation.
. Click on the *Settings* tab in the lower row.
. In the area *Barcode*, select the barcode configuration for {market} from the drop-down list.

[#old-export]
=== _Alternative 1:_ Old item export _(old method)_

This chapter describes how to export your item data to {market} using the old export.

[#600]
=== Linking categories

Link your plentymarkets categories to the Kaufland.de categories in order to display your items in these categories. Further items from the linked category are assigned automatically.

[.instruction]
Linking categories:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Kaufland.de » Category link*.
. Click on *Search* (icon:search[role="blue"]). +
→ The *Select category* window opens.
. Select the Kaufland.de category that best matches your plentymarkets category.
. Click on *Apply*. +

. If you already know the ID of the Kaufland.de category, enter it directly into the *Market category field* to link it to your plentymarkets category.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

[IMPORTANT]
.Subcategories do not have to be linked
====
In some cases, your subcategories may not match the Kaufland.de subcategories. In such cases, link your items with Kaufland.de's corresponding main category. Kaufland.de automatically assigns your items to a subcategory. You should not transfer items to Kaufland.de that have not been assigned to a Kaufland.de category.

include::partial$activate-characteristic.adoc[]

[#550]
==== Linking plentymarkets characteristics with Kaufland.de attributes

It is possible to overwrite attributes with plentymarkets characteristics or to add Kaufland.de attributes. +
*_Important:_* In order for the plentymarkets characteristics to be correctly assigned during the Kaufland.de export, the internal name of the plentymarkets characteristic must be the same as the column header in the Kaufland.de Product.csv file. +
The Kaufland.de attributes EAN, title, description, manufacturer and picture are mandatory entries for the item export. These attributes are transferred by plentymarkets by default. These attributes can only be overwritten by an attribute. Other attributes, such as "material_composition", "clothing_size" or "weight" can be added if a corresponding characteristic is created in plentymarkets.

[WARNING]
.Mandatory entries for the item export
====
The Kaufland.de attributes *ean*, *title*, *description*, *manufacturer* and *picture* are mandatory entries for the item export.
====

[.instruction]
Creating a characteristic:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Characteristics*.
. Click on the *New characteristic* tab.
. Enter the name of the Kaufland.de attribute into the *Name (internal)* field. +
→ The entered name is displayed in the item data record when linking characteristics.
. Enter a name in the *Webshop* field.  +
→ This name is used in the item overview of the plentyShop.
. Select the *Characteristic type*.
. Activate the option *Kaufland.de*.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

[#catalogue-export]
=== _Alternative 2:_ Catalogue export _(recommended)_

Catalogue formats provide you with a long-term and flexible way to export your item data. Item data is exported to Kaufland using a catalogue. +
Kaufland catalogues are created with the *Kaufland - Creating catalogues* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

[#create-catalogue]
==== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to Kaufland via a catalogue. Kaufland catalogues are created with the *Kaufland - Creating catalogues* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu. Afterwards, link the Kaufland data fields with item data saved in plentymarkets in the catalogue you created. +
After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to {market} once a day.

There is a separate catalogue format for each Kaufland product category. Different item data is exported in the different catalogue formats, depending on which information Kaufland requires for each product category. For example, different item data has to be mapped in the catalogues for *TVs* and *Cameras*. +
This means that you have to create a separate catalogue for each Kaufland product category that you want to sell your items in.

*_Note:_* At present, you can only create Kaufland catalogues with the assistant *Kaufland - Creating catalogues* and _not_ in the *Data » Catalogues* menu.

:number-of-boxes: info box

[#no-shipping-confirmation]
[.collapseBox]
.No shipping confirmation was sent. What now?
--

The event procedure <<#shipping-confirmation, Send shipping confirmation to Kaufland.de>> automatically informs {market} that the items of an order have shipped. If the event procedure cannot be completed, the order is moved to the status that you selected for the setting *Order status for orders with failed shipping confirmations*.

Check orders in this status:

* Is the shipping service provider linked correctly?
* Is a tracking number saved for the order?

After correcting the order, move the order to the status that triggers the event procedure <<#shipping-confirmation, Send shipping confirmation to Kaufland.de>>.
