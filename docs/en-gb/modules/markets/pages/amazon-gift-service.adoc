By activating the Amazon gift service, your customers can choose to have their items gift wrapped and they can leave a gift message during the order process on Amazon. These options are transferred to plentymarkets when orders are automatically retrieved. No additional settings need to be carried out. Each order item containing gift options has an additional line of information with the ID *-2* added to it directly behind the actual ordered item. It includes the type of packaging as well as the greeting.

Activate the gift options in Amazon Seller Central in order to use the gift service.
