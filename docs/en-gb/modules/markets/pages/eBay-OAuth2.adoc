.eBay OAuth2 plugin not required any longer
====
You do not need to install a plugin anymore in order to authenticate eBay accounts for OAuth2 in plentymarkets. Instead, you can now authenticate eBay accounts for OAuth2 in the *Setup » Markets »  eBay » Accounts » OAuth2* menu. +
For further information, refer to the <<markets/ebay/ebay-setup#oauth2, Setting up eBay>> page of the manual.
====

The link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/channels/marktplaetze/ebayoauth2_4787[eBay OAuth2^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] plugin is used for all calls that are made to the new eBay APIs. These new APIs are based on the new authentication method OAuth2 instead of the old Auth-n-Auth method. Because the new authentication method is used for more and more essential tasks, you should install the *eBay OAuth2* plugin while you set up eBay.

[IMPORTANT]
.Download the eBay OAuth2 plugin

Download the following plugin:

== Activating and changing accounts

After having installed the plugin, go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » OAuth2* to activate new accounts for eBay. To do so, you will need your eBay access data consisting of the user name and password. When changing your eBay access data, you have to update and synchronise your account in plentymarkets. plentymarkets allows you to manage several eBay accounts. Proceed as follows to add one or more accounts:

[.instruction]
Activating an account:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » OAuth2*.
. Select *Add sandbox account* to activate an account for a test environment. +
*_Or:_* Select *Add production account* if the new account is already productive. +
→ You are forwarded to eBay and have to authenticate your data. +
*_Important:_* Pay attention to correctly copying upper and lower case spelling when you enter the account details. +
→ The account is activated. +
→ The account is shown in the *Setup » Markets » eBay » OAuth2* menu.

When activating or updating an account, a token is generated. This token is valid for 18 months. There is no automatic warning when the validity of the token expires. The token also becomes invalid if you change your eBay access data.

Go to *Setup » Markets » eBay » OAuth2* to rename, update or delete accounts. For example, you have to rename your account in plentymarkets when changing your eBay user name.
