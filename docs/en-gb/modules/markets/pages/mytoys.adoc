== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to myToys via catalogue formats. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues.

* Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, basic concept of the plentymarkets catalogues first>>.

To export your item data to myToys, you need to create catalogues. The catalogues have to be created specifically for each category. Depending on the selected category, the required mandatory fields and optional fields vary. Link the data fields required by myToys with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to myToys in regular intervals.

[#600]
=== Notes on the myToys item data structure

The structure of myToys item data differs from the structure in plentymarkets. Note the difference in the terms that are used:

. *Product:*The *product* on myToys is the same as the *item* in plentymarkets.
. *Item:*The *item* on myToys is the same as the *variation* in plentymarkets.

Just like variations are based on items in plentymarkets, items are based on products on myToys. Thus, you assign attributes to items on myToys, such as colour or size. This similarity regarding the item structure facilitates the assignment of data fields within the catalogues.

[#650]
=== Creating a catalogue in the assistant

[#700]
=== Mapping catalogue fields

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. This chapter describes how you map data fields and what particularities apply for item exports to myToys. In addition, we provide recommendations for suitable mappings. This information is structured as follows:

* <<#750, Mapping data fields in the catalogue>>
* <<#800, Notes on mapping data fields>>

[#750]
==== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

Now, map the myToys data fields to the item data saved in plentymarkets. Take note of the information regarding specific mappings and recommendations in this chapter.

[IMPORTANT]
.Simple and complex mappings in catalogues
====
In general, there are two ways of mapping data fields in catalogues. To avoid problems regarding the data exchange with myToys, you should always proceed carefully when assigning the data fields.

* *Simple mapping:* One plentymarkets data field is mapped with exactly one data field on myToys. An example of this would be the precise specification of a brand or the item weight. Learn how to create mappings of this kind in catalogues in the section *_Possibility 1: Map one plentymarkets data field_* below.

* *Complex mapping:* Several plentymarkets data fields is mapped with one data field on myToys. This way, you can use the data field for the item colour *Red* provided by myToys to link it to further properties that exist in your plentymarkets system such as *light red*, *dark red* and *cherry-red*. The item or variation can then be found with all of the three different properties if customers filter for *Red* on myToys. Note that it is not possible to map the type *None* when working with complex mappings. Learn how to create mappings of this kind in catalogues in the section *_1:n mapping - 1 marketplace data field, several plentymarkets data fields_*.
====

include::_textblocks/catalogues/instructions/catalogue-mapping.adoc[]

[#800]
==== Notes on mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. As such, there are some particularities for each market when mapping data fields. <<#catalogue-myToys-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for myToys.

Also, note that there are several *Mandatory fields* for myToys. At least those mandatory fields have to be filled with data when creating the mapping. You can display the mandatory fields by clicking on the toggle button (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) *Only display mandatory fields*.

For some mappings, it makes sense to create <<item/settings/properties#500, properties>> beforehand. The properties are only available for mappings after they have been created and saved. Thus, make sure you have created all necessary properties in advance. +

myToys cannot process HTML tags, so they will be filtered out. Keep this in mind, particularly when working with <<#option-itemtext, item descriptions>> and <<#option-bulletpoints, bullet points>>.

[[catalogue-myToys-mappings]]
.Notes on mapping data fields
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
| Marketplace data field | Explanation

| *Product name*
| Enter the item name in German. There is no character limit for product names. Nonetheless, make sure not to use too many characters because myToys will automatically cut off products name that are too long. Thus, keep the product name as short as possible. +
Manufacturers or brand names do not have to be included in the product name, as this information is displayed separately (above the product name) on myToys. Also, colours, sizes, gender information or repetitions are not allowed as parts of product names.

| *Brand*
| In plentymarkets, this is the manufacturer.

| [option-itemtext]*Texts*
| Link the data field *Item text* to display the item description saved in your plentymarkets system on myToys. +
The maximum number of characters is 4000\. After that, the text will be cut off and followed by “...”.

| *Colour and size*
| Both in plentymarkets and on myToys, colour and size are attributes that create variations.

| *RRP*
| The <<item/settings/prices#, RRP>> must have the referrer myToys. +
If the sales prices is higher than or equal to the RRP, the RRP will not be displayed on the item page on myToys. If the sales price is lower than the RRP, the sales price will be displayed as a strikethrough price. +
*_Note:_* If no RRP is available, for example because you are manufacturing the item yourself, assign the sales price once again in the *RRP* field. This way, no strikethrough price will be displayed on myToys.

| [option-bulletpoints]*Bullet points*
| Additional information on an item is displayed on the myToys item page by means of bullet points. We recommend that you use the property *Text* in plentymarkets to maintain this data. +
The maximum number of characters for bullet points is 255\. After that, the text will be cut off and followed by “...”.

| *Season*
| If you wish to sell an item that is independent of any season, select the option *NOOS* (never out of season). Additional abbreviations: +
- *SS* = Summer / spring +
- *AW* = Autumn / winter

| *Pattern*
| If you wish to sell an item without pattern, select *uni* here.

| *EAN*
| This is a mandatory field, meaning that the value has to be saved at the item. It will be transmitted to myToys as it is.

| *Material composition*
| Some categories, such as fashion, require you to enter the material composition. Of the five fields available, at least one field has to be linked. This is a multi-dimensional mapping: +
In step 1, link the material type (complex mapping), such as "upper material". +
In step 2, enter the material composition of “upper material” in the following format: +
{"material1": "percentage","material2": "percentage","material3": "percentage"} +
*_Example:_* {"WO": "90","EL": "10"} +
*_Note:_* Refer to link:https://cdn02.plentymarkets.com/pmsbpnokwu6a/frontend/myToys/myToys_Materialien_sortiert.pdf[this document] to access a full list of all material types accepted my myToys.


| *Item weight*
| The entered value is transmitted in grams.

| *Age recommendation*
| If you enter an age recommendation, myToys will automatically decide in which shop the item will appear. All items with entries *up to 16 years* will be listed on myToys. All items with entries *18 years or higher* will be listed on mirapodo/yomonda. Thus, take note of the following categorisation: +
- *new born* = 0-9 months +
- *baby* = 9-24 months +
- *mini* = 2-8 years +
- *teen* = 8-16 years +
- *adult* = 18-99 years

== Troubleshooting: Viewing log entries

NOTE: Your variations were not exported to myToys? No variation data is exported if one or more variations do not meet the requirements of myToys. This means that none of your variations will be exported to myToys if one of your variations is invalid. To find the error, check the entries in the data log.

:market: myToys
include::partial$viewing_logs.adoc[tag=data-log-intro]

* *Integration* » *myToys*
* *Reference type* » *variationId*

include::partial$viewing_logs.adoc[tag=data-log-config]

In addition to the method described above, you can also specifically check the variations for which mandatory fields have not been filled in. To check this information, carry out the following settings in advance.

[.instruction]
Find variations with missing mandatory fields:

. Go to *Data » Log*.
. Click on *Configure logs* (icon:cog[]).
. Select *myToys* from the list.
. Activate the option *Active*.
. Select the *Duration* for which you want the log level to stay active.
. In the drop-down menu *Log level*, activate the option *Debug*.
. *Save* (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

After you have carried out these settings, you can click on *myToys* entries with the level *Debug* in the *Data » Log* menu. This way, the entries will expand and further details regarding missing mandatory fields is displayed.
