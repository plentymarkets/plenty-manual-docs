.Deactivating variation availability
====
If you deactivate the market availability for {market} of a variation in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Tab: Availability*menu, the variation is deactivated on {market}. If you reactivate the availability of such a variation, the variation is only reactivated on {market} during the nightly item export. +
*_Note:_* To deactivate the variation, the property *{market} category group* has to be remain saved in the *Properties* tab of the respective variation.
====

[#link-category-property]
=== Linking variation to market category

After you created the first marketplace format for {market} with the assistant, the property *{market} category group* is created in your plentymarkets system. For each category that you create a catalogue for, a new selection value is added to this property. This selection value has the same name as the category.

In order for your variations to be exported in the appropriate catalogue, they have to be linked to the *{market} category group* property in the *Properties* tab of the variation.

[.instruction]
Linking a variation to the {market} category group:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item]*.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that should be linked.
. Open the *Properties* tab.
. In the *Variation properties* area, select the property *{market} category group* from the *Properties* drop-down list and click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is added.
. Select the desired category group from the *Value* drop-down list for the *{market} category group* property. +
→ The variation is exported in the catalogue for this category.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#550]
== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to {market} using catalogue formats. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

To export your item data to {market}, you need to create catalogues. The catalogues have to be created specifically for each category. Depending on the selected category, the required mandatory fields and optional fields vary. Link the {market} data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to myToys in regular intervals.
// TODO: rewrite

[#600]
=== Notes on the {market} item data structure

The structure of {market} item data differs from the structure in plentymarkets. Only the naming is different:

. The *product* on {market} is the same as the *item* in plentymarkets.
. The *item* on {market} is the same as the *variation* in plentymarkets.

=== Mapping catalogue fields

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. This chapter describes how you map data fields and what particularities apply for item exports to {market}. In addition, we provide recommendations for suitable mappings. This information is structured as follows:

* <<#750, Mapping data fields in the catalogue>>
* <<#800, Notes on mapping data fields>>

[#750]
==== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

Now, map the {market} data fields to the item data saved in plentymarkets. Take note of the information regarding specific mappings and recommendations in this chapter.

include::partial$catalogue-mapping.adoc[]

[#800]
==== Notes on mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. <<#catalogue-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for {market}.

Also take note of the following general information:

* Map at least all *mandatory fields*. You can limit the data fields shown to the mandatory fields by clicking on the toggle button (icon:toggle-on[role="green"]) *Only display mandatory fields*.

* For some mappings, it makes sense to create xref:item:properties.adoc#500[properties] beforehand. You need to create and save these properties before you can map them in the catalogue. Thus, make sure you have created all necessary properties.

* {market} cannot process HTML tags. As such, HTML tags are removed during the export. Keep this in mind, particularly when working with <<#option-itemtext, item descriptions>> and <<#option-bulletpoints, bullet points>>.
//TODO

[[catalogue-mappings]]
.Notes on mapping data fields
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
| Marketplace data field | Explanation

| *Product name*
| Map the plentymarkets data field *Name 1*, *Name 2* or *Name 3*.

The following rules apply to product names:

* Enter the item name in German.
* There is no character limit for product names. However, do not use too many characters because {market} will automatically cut off products name that are too long. Thus, keep the product name as short as possible.
* You do not need to mention the manufacturer or any own brands in the product name. This information is shown separately above the item name on {market}.
* Colours, sizes, gender information or repetitions are not allowed as part of product names.

| *Brand*
| Map the plentymarkets data field *Item » External manufacturer name*.

| [option-itemtext]*Texts*
| map the plentymarkets data field *Item text » Item text*. +
The item description can be up to 4000 characters long. Longer text is cut off after 4000 characters and `...` is added. +

*_Note:_* Do you use HTML tags to format your item texts? +
{market} cannot process HTML tags. As such, HTML tags are removed during the export. As such, check your item texts. If you use a lot of HTML tags, you might want to create a property in which you save item descriptions without HTML tags.

| *Colour*
| The colour is used to create variations in plentymarkets and on {market}.

You need two marketplace data fields for exporting colours:

[cols="1,2"]
!===
! Marketplace data field ! Mapping recommendation

! *General Attributes > Colour*
! Map an attribute for colours to the marketplace data field *Colour*.

! *Colour > Colour*
! To each {market} colour shade, map an attribute value of the same attribute for colours that you mapped to the marketplace data field *General Attributes > Colour*.
!===

[.collapseBox]
.Do you have different colour shades than {market}, for example “light red”, “dark read” and “cherry red” instead of “red”?
--
If you use colour shades that differ from {market}, you can map fallback data fields.

*_Example:_* In addition to *Red*, you also use the shades *Light red*, *Dark red* and *Cherry red* which you manage either as attribute values or property values.

Map these attribute/property values to the marketplace data field *Red* as fallback data fields.

Customers can then find the variation with all of the three different properties when they filter for the colour *Red* on {market}.
--

| *Size*
| The size usually is used to create variations in plentymarkets and on {market}. As such, map an attribute for size information. +
*_Note:_* Whether or not the size is used to create variations largely depends on your product portfolio. If your variations were created without attributes for sizes, contact the {market} integration team to talk about how you can proceed.

| *RRP*
| Map a sales price of the type *RRP*. The referrer {market} must be activated for this sales price.

RRP are shown on {market} based on the following logic:

* If the sales price is lower than the RRP, the RRP is shown on {market} as a strikethrough price.
* If the sales prices is higher than or equal to the RRP, the RRP will not be displayed on {market}.

*_Note:_* You do not have any RRP, for example because you are the manufacturer? Then assign the same sales price as for the marketplace data field *Net sales price*. This way, no strikethrough price will be displayed on {market}.

| [option-bulletpoints]*Bullet points*
| Additional information on an item is displayed on the {market} item page using bullet points.

The following rules apply for bullet points:

* Up to 255 characters can be exported per bullet point.
* The text is cut off after 355 characters and `...` is added.
* {market} cannot process HTML tags. As such, HTML tags are removed during the export. +
*_Tip:_* Do not use HTML tags in the properties for the bullet points.

*_Recommendation:_* Create a separate property of the type *Text* for each bullet point.

| *Season*
| Map the values of a plentymarkets property to the seasons. +
*_Tip:_* For variations that are not seasonal, save the property value that you mapped to the {market} value *NOOS* in the catalogue.

{market} uses the following abbreviations for seasons:

* NOOS = never out of stock
* FS = Spring/summer
* HW = Autumn/winter

| *Pattern*
| Map the values of a plentymarkets property to each pattern. +
*_Tip:_* For variations that do not have a pattern, save the property value that you mapped to the {market} value *uni* in the catalogue.

| Material composition
| You need to specify the material composition to list products in some categories. This is particularly relevant for textiles and shoes.

Two marketplace data fields are combined to export material composition information:

* *General Components > Textile composition - 1. material composition textile* is used to export the composition in percent.
* *Textile component 1* specifies the part of the variation to which the percentages relate. For example, this could be the lining or the cuffs.

As a minimum, you need to map *1\. material composition textile* and *Textile component 1*. The data fields for materials 2 to 5 are optional.

[cols="1,3a"]
!===
! *General Components >* +

*Textile composition - 1. Material composition textile* +

to +

*Textile composition - 5. Material composition textile*
! These marketplace data fields are used to specify the material composition in percent.

Use a property to specify material compositions in percent:

. Create a property of the type *Text*.
. Links the property with the variation.
. Enter the material composition in the text field of the property. Use the following format:

  * *{"material1": "percentage","material2": "percentage","material3": "percentage"}* +
  *_Important:_* The values for material types you enter must be identical to the
  link:https://cdn02.plentymarkets.com/pmsbpnokwu6a/frontend/myToys/myToys_Materialien_sortiert.pdf[values that {market} uses^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].
  * *_Example:_* `{"WO": "90","EL": "10"}`

! *Textile component 1*
! As described above, the marketplace data field *General Components > Textile composition - 1. Material composition textile* is used to specify the material composition of a variation in percent. However, {market} does not know which part of the variation these percentages relate to. As such, the marketplace data field *Textile component 1* specifies to {market} which component of a variation the percentages relate to.

Examples of textile components are Obermaterial (upper), Außenjacke (outer jacket), Beinfutter (leg lining), or Bündchen (cuffs). You can find a complete list of the textile components {market} uses link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plentymarkets/manual/master/de/maerkte/assets/mytoys-textilkomponenten.txt[here^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

Use a property to specify the textile components:

. Create a property of the type *Selection*.
. Save all components that you need for your variation as selection values.
. In the catalogue, map the selection values of the property to the different {market} textile components.
. Links the property with the variation.
. Select a suitable property value.

!===

| *Item weight*
| The entered value is transmitted in grams.

| *Age recommendation*
| The age recommendation defines the target group. This information is used to automatically determine the shop in which the variation is published:

* Variations with an age recommendation of *up to 16 years* are published on {market}.
* Variations with an age recommendation of *18 years or higher* are published on mirapodo/yomonda.

The following values can be used:

* *new born* = 0-9 months +
* *baby* = 9-24 months +
* *mini* = 2-8 years +
* *teen* = 8-16 years +
* *adult* = 18-99 years

[.collapseBox]
.Map a property for *Age recommendation* and link it to your variations
--

. Create a property with the following settings:
* Name: Age group
* Section: Item
* Type: Selection
* Selection values:
  ** *new born*
  ** *baby*
  ** *mini*
  ** *teen*
  ** *adult*
. In the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Variation tab: Settings*, link the variation to the property.
. Select the property value that suits the variation.
