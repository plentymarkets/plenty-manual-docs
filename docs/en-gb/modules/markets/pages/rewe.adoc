[cols="1,3"]
!===
! *Consider variation setting 'Limitation'* +
(default setting)
! Stock is exported as specified for each variation. Stock limitation is managed in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Variation tab: Settings » Area: Availability* menu using the option *Limitation*. +
*_Note:_* For variations for which the *Limitation* setting is set to *Do not administer stock for this variation*, a stock of 1000 is exported to REWE.

! *Export actual net stock*
! The stock *Limit* setting is ignored for all variations during export to REWE. Instead, the actual net stock is exported to REWE for each variation. You can check the actual net stock in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Variation tab: Stock » Tab: Stock* menu in the column *Net*. +
*_Note:_* For variations for which the *Limitation* setting is set to *Do not administer stock for this variation*, a stock of 0 is exported to REWE. As such, the variation cannot be bought on REWE. +
*_Tip:_* The net stock is the quantity of a variation that is available for sale. The net stock is a subset of the physical stock. Substract all reserved quantities from the physical stock and you will get the net stock.

include::partial$define-sales-price.adoc[]

[#1800]
== Managing promotion prices

You can export promotion prices that are valid for a specific period.

IMPORTANT: The promotion price is not started and ended on REWE automatically. The promotion price is only started and ended when you edit the price that is saved for the REWE special offer price in plentymarkets.

[#1801]
=== Defining a promotion price

Prerequisites for correctly exporting promotion prices:

* You have created a sales price of the type *Special offer*. +
  *_Tip:_* Do not forget to activate the referrer *REWE* for this special offer price.
* You have mapped the following data fields in the REWE catalogues:
  ** Marketplace data field *Promotion price* plentymarkets sales price of the type *Special offer*
  ** Marketplace data field *Promotion starts* = plentymarkets property *REWE promotion price start date*
  ** Marketplace data field *Promotion ends* = plentymarkets property *REWE promotion price end date*

[.instruction]
Defining a promotion price:

. Link the sales price of the type *Special offer* to the variation.
. Save a price for the special offer price.
. Link the variation with the property *REWE promotion price start date*.
. Save a date for the property. +
*_Important:_* The promotion price is not started automatically on this date.
. Link the variation with the property *REWE promotion price end date*.
. Save a date for the property. +
*_Important:_* The promotion price is not ended automatically on this date.
. Set yourself a reminder for the start date and the end date. On these days, you need to start and end the promotion price yourself.

[#1802a]
=== Starting the promotion price on the start date

On the start date, you need to change the price that you saved for the REWE special offer price in plentymarkets. This updates the prices on REWE and starts the promotion price.

There are several ways of changing the prices. Here, we show you two examples based on the number of variations for which you want to start promotion prices.

[tabs]
====
Price changes for one or a small number of variations::
+
--
. Open the variation.
. Change the amount for the promotion price. For example, change the last decimal point of the amount.
. Save the change. +
→ The promotion price for the variation is started on REWE. +
*_Tip:_* You can change back to the original price straight way. The change only serves to update the price on REWE.
--

Price changes for many variations::
+
--
. Open the variation group function.
. Carry out a price change for the promotion price. For an example, see the screenshot below.
. Execute the variation group function. +
→ The promotion price is started for all variations that have reached or exceeded the start date saved in the property *REWE promotion price start date*. +
*_Tip:_* You can change back to the original price straight way. The change only serves to update the price on REWE.

.Price change: Increase by one cent for all REWE special offer prices

[#1802]
=== Ending promotion prices on the end date

On the end date, you need to change the price that you saved for the REWE special offer price in plentymarkets. This updates the prices on REWE and ends the promotion price.

There are several ways of changing the prices. Here, we show you two examples based on the number of variations for which you want to end promotion prices.

[tabs]
====
Price changes for one or a small number of variations::
+
--
. Open the variation.
. Change the amount for the promotion price. For example, change the last decimal point of the amount.
. Save the change. +
→ The promotion price for the variation is ended on REWE. +
→ The normal sales price is shown as the new price. +
*_Tip:_* You can change back to the original price straight way. The change only serves to update the price on REWE.

== Setting the commission

[TIP]
.Commission settings are optional
====
The settings for the commission for REWE are optional. If you do not set a commission, orders will be imported into plentymarkets with the sales prices that are displayed at REWE. +
If no commission is set, prices will also be displayed without commission on the delivery note.
====

The standard commission is set up in the *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings* menu. The commission serves to calculate the order sums free of commission.

Order sums free of commission are calculated with this formula:

* Sales price REWE = Sales price customer * (1 - conversion factor)
* Conversion factor = Commission * (1 + VAT rate)

For the calculation, the percentages for commission and VAT rate are converted into the corresponding factor, that is, divided by 100. The conversion factor is rounded to 3 decimal places.

[.instruction]
Setting the commission:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » REWE » Basic settings*.
. In the *Commission* area, enter a number for the commission in percent.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings. +
→ The commission is the default commission for all items except for any variations for which a separate commission was set up.

You can set up a separate commission for variations. To do so, use the *REWE commission* variation property. The variation property *REWE commission* is created automatically when the REWE plugin is installed. In order to set up a separate commission for a variation, link the variation to the variation property *REWE commission*.

[.instruction]
Setting up a separate commission for variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Open the variation that you would like to set up a separate commission for.
. Open the variation's *Properties* tab.
. From the *Properties* drop-down list, select *REWE commission*.
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The property is linked to the variation.
. Enter a whole number or a decimal number into the *Value* field for the commission in percent.
. Save (terra:save[]) the settings.

== Linking variations with the property REWE product type

Variations that you want to sell on REWE have to be linked with the *REWE product type* variation property. This variation property is created in your plentymarkets system as soon as you have installed the REWE plugin. Examples for REWE product types are:

* Household
* Garden
* Fashion

[#900]
== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to REWE via catalogues. The assistant *Creating REWE catalogues* helps you to create a catalogue for a specific product category.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Items cannot be deleted on commercetools
====
Items cannot be deleted on commercetools, neither by plentymarkets nor by REWE or commercetools. Therefore, make extra sure that the correct data fields are mapped in the catalogue prior to transferring your items.
====

At present, the REWE plugin allows you to create catalogues for the following REWE product categories:

* *AFG* (Soft Drinks)
* *Alcoholic beverages*
* *Baby Supplies*
* *Books and Magazines*
* *Drugstore*
* *Fashion*
* *Leisure/sports*
* *Garden*
* *Household*
* *Multimedia*
* *Contact Lenses*
* *Food* +
_Information for the food product category:_ +
  ** Food specifications must always be made for 100g.
  ** Energy information must be provided in kcal.
  ** If the *Nutrition information for prepared and non-prepared foods* field is not mapped, the value *non-prepared* is transferred to REWE by default.
* *New Media (DVD etc.)*
* *Stationary*
* *Sets*
* *Toys*
* *Pet supplies*

[#1001]
=== Notes on the REWE item data structure: product groups and variations

REWE differentiates between *product groups* and *variation groups*.

[cols="1,5a"]
|====
| Product group
|
* The variations look different.
* As a result, every plentymarkets variation has its own images.
* Product group attributes are attributes that influence how the product looks

*_Examples:_*

* An item is sold in different colours and/or with different prints.
* An item is sold in different sizes and the packaging for each size is different.

*_In plentymarkets:_*

In plentymarkets, product groups are items with variations with at least one REWE group attribute, depending on the product type.

*_Example for attribute:_*

For the product type Food, the following *Attributes for product group* are available (as of 05/2021):

* Flavour
* Package size
* Variety

*_Notes on mapping data fields:_*

Items in plentymarkets can have more than one REWE group attribute. However, only one REWE group attribute can be used to form product groups. Therefore, the *Attribute for product group* field has to be matched so that the first attribute will always be the attribute that you want to use to form a product group. If an item differs in colour and print and the print should be used as the REWE group attribute, you first have to map the print in the marketplace data field *Attribute for product group* and only then map the colour.

*_Tip:_*

The REWE group attributes for each product type are available in the catalogue templates. To do so, open the drop-down list *Attribute for product group* in the marketplace format.

| Variations
|
* The variations look the same.
* As a result, the images for all variations are identical.
* Variation attributes are attributes that do not influence how the product looks.

*_Examples:_*

* An item is available in different sizes. All sizes look the same.
* An item is available in different package sizes. However, the images are identical for all variations.

*_In plentymarkets:_*

In plentymarkets, *variations* are variations of an item no more than one REWE variation attribute, depending on the product type.

*_Example for attribute:_*

For the product type Food, the following *Attributes for variation group* are available (as of 05/2021):

* Diameter
* Dimensions
* General size

*_Notes on mapping data fields:_*

* For REWE variation attributes, only one variation attribute can be set, for example only size or only volume.
* An item should not be linked to more than one attribute which was assigned as REWE variation attribute in the catalogue.

*_Tip:_*

The REWE variation attributes for each product type are available in the catalogue templates. To do so, open the drop-down list *Attribute for variation group* in the marketplace format.

[.collapseBox]
.Step *Mapping basic data fields*
--
In this step of the assistant, you decide which variation data saved in plentymarkets you want to send to the market. To do so, you are going to map each data field of the market with the plentymarkets data field that contains the data that you want to export to the market. Instead of mapping an existing data field, you can also instead create a new data field for some fields.

'''
*SKU* = From the drop-down list, select the data field in plentymarkets that contains the SKU. +
*_Recommendation:_* The variation ID is unique for each variation. Map the marketplace data field *SKU* to the plentymarkets data field *Variation ID*. +
*_Note:_* Do not change the SKU and Parent SKU of a variation once the variation has been created on commercetools.

'''
*Select data field* = A data field that already exists in plentymarkets will be exported to REWE. Select a data field from the drop-down list *Data field*. +
*_Note:_* The mappings you create will not be checked in terms of logic. As such, check your mappings carefully before starting the export.

'''
*Create property* = Creates a xref:item:properties.adoc#500[property] and maps this property to the data field. Properties can be used to export values for data fields that have no corresponding item data saved in plentymarkets, such as *Diameter*.

Automatically created property will be saved in the xref:item:properties.adoc#500[Setup » Settings » Properties » Configuration] menu.

Automatically created properties are created with the following settings:

* Section = Item
* Type = _depending on the market data field_
* Language = German
* Name = _Name of the product category_
* Group = REWE

'''
*Creating a sales price* = Creates a sales price and maps this sales price to the data field. You can check and edit automatically created sales prices in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu.

Automatically created sales prices are created with the following settings:

* Subscription interval = None
* Internal name = REWE
* External name = REWE
* Minimum quantity = 1
* Live conversion = No
* Currency = Euro
* Display = Always display for new items
* Client = ALL
* Class = ALL
* Country = Germany

'''
*Create barcode* = Creates a barcode *REWE* and maps this barcode to the data field. If a barcode with the name *REWE* already exists in the system, that barcode is mapped instead. You can check and edit automatically created barcodes in the *Setup » Item » Barcodes* menu.
--

[#600]
=== Mapping additional data fields in the catalogue (not in assistant)

You have already mapped important mandatory fields for the REWE product category in the assistant. However, after you have completed the assistant, you need to map additional data fields to send more information regarding your products to REWE.

:catalogue-assistant:

include::partial$catalogue-mapping.adoc[]

[#905]
=== Particularities for mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. As such, there are some particularities for each market when mapping data fields. <<#catalogue-rewe-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for REWE.

[[catalogue-rewe-mappings]]
.Notes on mapping data fields
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
| Marketplace data field | plentymarkets data field

| *SKU*
| We recommend to link the data field *SKU* with the plentymarkets data field *Variation ID* because the variation ID is clearly assigned to the variation. +
*_Note:_* Do not change the SKU and Parent SKU of a variation once the variation has been created on commercetools. If you change the SKU or the Parent SKU later, the variation will no longer be updated on commercetools.

| *Attribute for product group*
| As <<#1001, described above>>, REWE distinguishes between product bgroups and variation groups.

*_Reminder:_* You need a REWE product group if the variations of an item have different images because they look different. Product group attributes are attributes that influence how the product looks.

As such, you would pap the following plentymarkets data field to the marketplace data field *Attribute for product group*:

* *_Alternative 1:_* An attribute that changes the look of the variations
* *_Alternative 2:_* A property that changes the look of the variations

Of course you can also map fallback data fields. This might be necessary if you use both attributes and properties in plentymarkets for the data that you want to export for the marketplace data field *Attribute for product group*.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example 1:_* Mapping colour information for product type "Fashion"
--
The following example describes how you can map colour information in a catalogue for the product type "Fashion".
