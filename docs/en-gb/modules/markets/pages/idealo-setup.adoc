== About idealo

idealo started business in 2000 with the vision of helping users to make the right choices when buying products online and, now counting 50,000 sellers and 18 million users per month, has become one of Germany's most important e-commerce websites.

With idealo Checkout, idealo offers a strong sales channel. The "Zum Kauf" (Buy now) button allows users to order a product directly on idealo.de, using a fully integrated checkout function. The sellers remain the contractual partners and take care of fulfilment as usual.

With plentymarkets, you can both use the idealo price comparison and idealo Checkout. idealo Checkout enables your customers to buy items directly on the idealo website without having to enter your plentyShop.

[#100]
== Registering with idealo

In order to set up idealo in your plentymarkets system, you have to register as an idealo seller first.

[#3000]
== Select a method for item data export

Inform idealo about how item data should be transferred before setting up idealo in plentymarkets (creating, updating, and deleting items on idealo). You can either transfer item data to idealo with the automatic item export via an API (PWS 2.0 interface) or with a CSV file using the elastic export. <<#item-export-idealo-1>> shows the most important differences between these two methods of exporting item data. How to set up the different methods of data transfer in plentymarkets is described in the chapter <<#800, Setting up the item export>>.

|======
|Setting |Explanation

| *Would you like to export your items to idealo via interface (Partner Web Service 2.0)?*
|Items can be exported to idealo via interface or via CSV file with the elastic export. Check with idealo how item data should be transferred before the setup in plentymarkets. Via interface, prices and stock will be transferred every fifteen minutes. The interval of data transfer with CSV export is defined by idealo.

| *Would you like to export your stock and prices?*
| *Export stock and prices* activated = Prices and stock are updated every 15 minutes.

| *Would you like to import your idealo Checkout orders into plentymarkets?*
|Activate to import orders every 15 minutes automatically. +
*_Note:_* You need to activate this option to export item data and stock information.

| *What order status do you want to assign to idealo Checkout orders cancelled before the import?*
| Some idealo Checkout orders are cancelled before they are first imported to your plentymarkets system. Select the order status that is to be assigned to such cancelled orders during the import. +
*_Note:_* The import of these cancelled idealo Checkout orders triggers the event procedures set up for the selected status. As such, select a status that does not trigger any event procedures (such as cancellation confirmations being sent to customers).

| *Do you want to continue processing open MOA 1.0 orders with this account?*
| The idealo Merchant Order API is a REST API for retrieving and processing idealo Checkout orders. In January 2021, idealo updated this REST API from version 1.0 to version 2.0. Activate this setting if you used this account to import orders with the old MOA 1.0 interface. Any open orders will then be processed automatically as usual. Ignore this setting if you are setting up a new idealo account.

| [#intable-status-cancellation-by-buyer]*What status should an order change to when customers request a cancellation?*
| Customers might only request a cancellation after an idealo Checkout order is already imported into your plentymarkets system. Such cancellation requests are imported into plentymarkets every 15 minutes. Select an order status that is assigned to these orders. A separate status allows you to view and process these orders individually. +
*_Tip:_* Set up the event procedure <<#1803, Accept cancellation by buyer>> to process cancellation requests automatically.

| *Up to which status should requests for order cancellations by customers be considered?*
| Which orders cancelled by customers should be moved to the order status that you selected above? Set a limit for accepting cancellation requests. +
→ Orders with this or a lower status are moved to the status you selected for *What status should an order change to when customers request a cancellation?* if customers request a cancellation. +
→ Orders with a higher order status remain in their original status, i.e. are not moved into the status for orders cancelled by customers.

[IMPORTANT]
.Data transfer to idealo
====
Check with idealo how item data should be transferred before the setup in plentymarkets.

[#850]
=== Item data export via API (PWS 2.0)

If you want to transfer your items to idealo via API, go through the *idealo Basic settings* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Plugins » [Open client]* menu and activate the automatic item data export. Apart from the assistant, no further settings are required to set up the automatic item export in plentymarkets. +

If you transfer your items via API, items will be created at idealo once per day. Prices and stock are updated every 15 minutes. Items can also be deleted every 15 minutes.


[#900]
=== Item data export via elastic export

If you export items via the elastic export, you have to carry out a few settings in the *Data » Elastic export* menu to set up the export format. In order to use the elastic export, the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/sales/marktplaetze/elasticexport_4763[Elastic Export^] plugin must be installed in your plentymarkets system. First create the data format IdealoDE and afterwards transfer the URL to idealo so that idealo will be able to retrieve your item data.

How to set up the elastic export to export your items to idealo is described in the following chapters <<#950, Setting up the data format IdealoDE plugin in plentymarkets>> and <<#1000, Available columns for the export file>>.

[#950]
==== Setting up the data format idealo-Plugin in plentymarkets

[TIP]
.Settings only for elastic export
====
The settings described in this chapter only need to be carried out if you transfer your items to idealo with the elastic export.
====

[TIP]
.Check idealo product CSV
====
Not all of the columns of idealo’s product CSV are available in plentymarkets at present. Check whether you need columns which are not yet available in plentymarkets prior to setting up idealo in plentymarkets. In this case, an integration of idealo is currently not possible. +
An overview of the columns which are available in plentymarkets can be found in the <<#1000, Available columns for the export file>> chapter.
====

Set up the export format *IdealoDE* so that your items can be exported to idealo with the elastic export. For further information about the elastic export, refer to the xref:data:elastic-export.adoc#[Elastic Export] page. It is required to install the *Elastic export* plugin from the plentyMarketplace first before you can use the format *IdealoDE* for the elastic export.

[.instruction]
Creating a new export format:

. Go to *Data » Elastic export*.
. Click on *New export*.
. Carry out the desired settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#format-settings-idealo>>.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
