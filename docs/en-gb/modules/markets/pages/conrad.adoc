[#map-data-fields]
=== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. Check the documentation of the sales channel to find out what data the market expects for the individual data fields.

*_Note:_* Mandatory fields which have to be transferred to the market are marked with ***. Those fields have to be mapped with a plentymarkets data field. Otherwise, data cannot be transferred for this field.

[TIP]
.Using properties
====
Use xref:item:managing-items.adoc#500[properties] to export data for marketplace data fields that have no corresponding setting in plentymarkets.
====

include::partial$catalogue-mapping.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do _not_ map plentymarkets data fields to the following marketplace data fields for the market {market}:

* Product image 1
* Product image 2
* Product image 3
* Product image 4
* Product image 5

You can ignore the warning shown when you save the mapping.

[TIP]
.Datenfelder zur Grundpreisangabe pflegen
====
The two data fields *Gross content quantity for unit price specification* and *Unit of unit price specification* are not marked as mandatory fields, but they have to be maintained and transferred due to the legal requirement to specify the unit price.
A list with valid values is not available for both data fields. We recommend, however, to map the attribute *Gross content quantity for unit price specification* with the plentymarkets data field *Content quantity* and create a property for the attribute *Unit of unit price specification* and save the values at the variations, for example “g” for *gramme*.

[#marketplace-specific-values]
=== Transferring marketplace-specific values

The marketplace requires specific values for most of the attributes in order to be able to transfer product data. Currently, these values are, however, not yet saved at the variation. +
*_Example:_* For example, it is not allowed to enter *test* for the attribute *Brand*. You have to transfer the corresponding code in this case - in this example *BRAND_12345678*.

[#automating-order-processing]
== Automating order processing

Orders from Conrad are automatically imported in your plentymarkets system every 15 minutes.

This is how orders are processed at Conrad:

* The seller accepts the order via an event procedure.
* Conrad collects the payment.
* With the payment confirmation, the invoice and delivery address on the order are updated in your plentymarkets system.
* Via an event procedure, the shipping service provider as well as the package number are updated on the order in Mirakl.
* In the next step, the shipping notification is reported to Conrad via another event procedure.
* The invoice created by Conrad is imported to the order in your plentymarkets system.

The following order processing steps can be automated by setting up event procedures:

* Inform Conrad that the order was confirmed. <<#order-confirmation-conrad, How?>>

* Inform Conrad that the order was rejected. <<#order-rejection-conrad, How?>>

* Inform Conrad about the shipping confirmation. <<#shipping-confirmation-conrad, How?>>

* Inform Conrad that the order was cancelled. <<#order-cancellation-conrad, How?>>

* Inform Conrad about the refund of an item. <<#refund-conrad, How?>>
