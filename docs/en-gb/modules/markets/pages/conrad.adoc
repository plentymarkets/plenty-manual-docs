[#order-process]
== Order processing workflow

Orders from Conrad are automatically imported in your plentymarkets system every 15 minutes.

This is how orders are processed at Conrad:

* The seller accepts the order via an event procedure.
* Conrad collects the payment.
* With the payment confirmation, the invoice and delivery address on the order are updated in your plentymarkets system.
* Via an event procedure, the shipping service provider as well as the package number are updated on the order in Mirakl.
* In the next step, the shipping notification is reported to Conrad via another event procedure.
* The invoice created by Conrad is imported to the order in your plentymarkets system.

[TIP]
.Datenfelder zur Grundpreisangabe pflegen
====
The two data fields *Gross content quantity for unit price specification* and *Unit of unit price specification* are not marked as mandatory fields, but they have to be maintained and transferred due to the legal requirement to specify the unit price.
A list with valid values is not available for both data fields. We recommend, however, to map the attribute *Gross content quantity for unit price specification* with the plentymarkets data field *Content quantity* and create a property for the attribute *Unit of unit price specification* and save the values at the variations, for example “g” for *gramme*.
