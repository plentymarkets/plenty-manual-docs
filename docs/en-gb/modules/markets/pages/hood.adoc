Hood allows you to upload items and retrieve orders without an active store. You are required to have a store for some options, for example uploading item variations. You can link:https://www.hood.de/hood-shop-einrichten.htm[book^] a silver, gold or platinum store at Hood.

[#1000]
=== Uploading item variations

Set up the shop categories directly on link:https://www.hood.de/mein-shop.htm[Hood^]. To do so, go to *Mein Shop > Shop-Einstellungen > Kategorien*. Then load the categories into plentymarkets. This allows you to select them in the listing.

Existing HTML tags are deleted and only plain text is transferred.  +
HTML tags are permitted in the actual listing description.

These listings are not ended in plentymarkets either. Instead, they are displayed with the status *Hidden*. As soon as the item is back in stock in plentymarkets, the listing is reactivated on Hood during an automatic stock update.
