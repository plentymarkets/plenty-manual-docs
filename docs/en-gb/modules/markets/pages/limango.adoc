=== Saving mandatory variation information

As a minimum, you need to save the mandatory variation information to export your item data to limango. The following table shows the marketplace data fields that are mandatory for limango and how you save the necessary information in plentymarkets.

[cols="1,4a"]
|====
| Required | Setting in plentymarkets/explanation

| Product name
| Field *Name 1*, *Name 2*, or *Name 3* and either an attribute for colours or a property for colours

The following rules apply to product names:

* Enter the item name in German.
* Product names can have a maximum of 80 character but should be as short as possible.
* Do not mention the manufacturer or any own brands in the product name. This information is shown separately on limango.
* Sizes, gender information or repetitions are not allowed as part of product names.
* The colour must be part of the product name based on the pattern *Product name + in + Colour*. +
*_Example:_* `T-Shirt in Blau`

| Description
| plentymarkets data field *Item text* + additional product information in a property of the type *Text* for some categories. +
*_Example:_* For shoes, you need the field *Item text* + a material description.

*_Background:_* For some categories, limango expects additional product information. Depending on the category, this could for example be technical data or the scope of delivery. There is no default variation input field for this information. As such, we recommend that you save this product information in a property of the type *Text*. You could name this property `Additional product information limango`. In the catalogue, map the plentymarkets data field *Item text* combined with the property for the additional product information to the marketplace data field *Description*. +
*_Tip:_* Before your integration starts, limango will provide you with category-specific guidelines. Use these guidelines to make sure your descriptions comply with the legal and market-specific requirements.

*_The following rules apply to descriptions:_*

* The item description can be up to 10,000 characters long. Longer text is truncated after 10,000 characters.
* {market} cannot process HTML tags. As such, HTML tags are removed during the export. As such, check your item texts. If you use a lot of HTML tags, you might want to create a property in which you save item descriptions without HTML tags.
* For some categories, limango expects additional product information. Depending on the category, this could for example be technical data or the scope of delivery. There is no default variation input field for this information. As such, we recommend that you save this product information in a property of the type *Text*. You could name this property `Additional product information limango`. +
*_Tip:_* Before your integration starts, limango will provide you with category-specific guidelines. Use these guidelines to make sure your descriptions comply with the legal and market-specific requirements.

[.collapseBox]
.Special case: Selling shoes
--
The materials for shoes must be specified in the following order:

* upper material
* lining
* insole
* outer sole

Only the following material values are allowed: `Leder` (leather), `beschichtetes Leder` (coated leather), `Textil` (textile) and `sonstiges Material` (other material)

If you want to sell shoes on the market, all information regarding the material of your products must be exported to limango using the data field *Description*. To do this, you combine two plentymarkets data fields and export them as one filed to limango.

First, decide how you want to manage material information for your items. There are two ways to manage material information for limango:

* Enter the material information in the data field *Technical data* of the item.

_or_

* Create a property of the type *Text*. Link this property to the main variation of the item and manage the material information in this property.

Now, map the plentymarkets data field that you want in the catalogue:

. Map the plentymarkets data field that contains the item description to the marketplace data field *Description*.
. To the right of this data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]).
. Map the plentymarkets data field that contains the material information. +
*_Tip:_* This is either the field *Technical data* or the property that you created for the material information.
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. From the drop-down list *Separator*, select the option *Space*.
--

| Image URL
| Pictures can only be processed in jpg format.

| Material composition +
(*Sleeve lining*; +
*Upper 3*; +
*Upper 2*; +
*Upper 1*; +
*Membrane*; +
*Material 3* +
etc.)
| If textile fibres make up at least 80% of the weight of a product, you need to specify the material composition.

Material information is exported to limango using a property of the type *Text*. Create a separate property for each marketplace data field.

The names of these properties must be identical to the values that limango allows:

* link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plentymarkets/manual/master/de/maerkte/assets/limango-material-composite-types.txt[Valid values for material composite types^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]

Link the properties to the main variation of the item and save all components of a material mix in this property. If the variations of the same item have different material mixes, deactivate the inheritance function for properties and save the material mixes separately for each variation. However, note that this deactivates the inheritance for all properties for the item. As such, you also need to manually manage all other properties for each variation.

Specify the individual materials in descending order based on the percentage value. As such, the first material is the one with the highest percentage value, the last one that with the lowest percentage value. The sum of all percentages must be 100. You can specify as many materials as you need.
Enter the material composition in the following format:

* *{"materialtype1":"percentage","materialtype2":"percentage","materialtype3":"percentage"}* +
*`Example:_* {"baumwolle":"90","elasthan": "10"}_

The values for material types must be identical to the values that limango allows:

* link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plentymarkets/manual/master/de/maerkte/assets/limango-material-types.txt[Valid values for material types^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Exporting material information for a blazer to limango
--
The following example shows you how to save material information for a blazer for the limango export.

[.instruction]
Mapping outer fabric and saving material mix for a variation:

. Create a property of the type *Text* with the name *obermaterial*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Upper* to the plentymarkets property *obermaterial*.
. Link the property *obermaterial* to the main variation of the item.
. Our blazer is made of 65% polyester, 32% rayon and 3% elastane. Enter the following into the text field of the property:
  * `{"polyester":"65","viskose":"32","elasthan":"3"}`
. Save the settings.

[.instruction]
Mapping lining and saving material mix for a variation:

. Create a property of the type *Text* with the name *futter*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Lining* to the plentymarkets property *futter*.
. Link the property *futter* to the main variation of the item.
. The lining of the blazer is made of 100% rayon. Enter the following into the text field of the property:
  * `{"viskose": "100"}`
. Save the settings.
--

| RRP
| . Link a sales price of the price type *RRP* to the variations.
. Save a price.

*_The following rule applies for specifying the RRP:_*

* The RRP cannot be lower than the gross sales price.

| Gross sales price
| . Link a sales price with no price type to the variations. +
. Save a price.

| Category
| plentymarkets categories

| Brand
| . Save the manufacturer names in the menu *Setup » Item » Manufacturers*. +
. Select the manufacturer name for each variation.

*_Tip:_* Contact the limango partner management if you wan to list a new brand.

| Gender
| . Create a property of the type *Selection* with the following values:
  ** `Mann`
  ** `Frau` (woman)
  ** `Unisex`
. Link the properties to a variation and select a value.

image::markets:limango-gender-variation.png[]

| Altersgruppe
| . Create a property with the following settings:
* Name: Age group
* Section: Item
* Type: Selection
* Selection values:
  ** `Babys` (babies) = Children ≤ 1 year old
  ** `Kinder` (children) = Children > 1 year old
  ** `Erwachsene` (adults)
. In the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Variation tab: Settings*, link the variation to the property.
. Select the property value that suits the variation.

image::markets:limango-age-variation.png[]

| Colour
| The colour is used to create a unique product. As such, the colour must be a unique value, for example the manufacturer colour. To create the item number, the colour is added to the SKU.

If your variations were created without an attribute for colours, you need a property:

. Create a property of the type *Selection* and save the necessary colours as property values.
. Link the property to a variation and select one of the values. +
*_Tip:_* A property of the type *Selection* is a good idea if you work with recurring colour names.

_or_

. Create a property of the type *Text*.
. Link the property to a variation and enter the colour as the value. +
*_Tip:_* A property of the type *Text* may be more suitable if your colour range changes frequently. However, this increases the risk of typos.

| Size
| If your variations were created without an attribute for sizes, you need a property.

*_Note:_* Products without a size have the size value `onesize` on limango. Products without a size are single size products. These are products that are only available in one size. The size is not used to create variations. +
*_Example furniture:_* A chair is available in several colours but only in one colour. The size value `onesize` must be exported.

. Create a property of the type *Selection* and save the necessary sizes as property values. +
*_Tip:_* Do not forget to save the property value `onesize` for products that do not have a size.
. Link the property to a variation and select one of the values.

| Measurements +
(*Length*; +
*Width*; +
*Height*; +
*Volume*; +
*Diameter*; +
*Weight* +
etc.)
a| Only specify measurements for products with no size variations, i.e. for single size products such as furniture.

*_Background:_* In the limango shop, the measurements can only be shown at the product level. No measurements are shown at the variation level.

Measurements must be exported to limango with the format *[numeric value];[unit]*. Due to the limango product structure, the normal plentymarkets data fields for measurements cannot be mapped. Instead, create two properties:

* One property of the type *Decimal number* for the numerical value.
* One property of the type *Selection* for the unit with the following selection values:
  ** ml
  ** l
  ** mm
  ** cm
  ** m
  ** g
  ** kg

Combine these two properties, separated by a semicolon.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Exporting the length to limango
--
. Create a property of the type *Decimal number* with the name *Length*.
. Create a property of the type *Selection* with the name *Length unit*.
. Add the units you need to the property *Length unit* as property values.
. Open the limango catalogue.
. Map the marketplace data field *Length* to the plentymarkets property *Length*.
. To the right of this data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]).
. Map the property *Length unit*. +
*_Tip:_* If you are sure that you only need one unit for all your variations, you can also export the unit by entering it as an own value. To do so, instead of mapping the property *Length unit*, map the field *Own value* and enter the unit in the field that opens.
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. From the drop-down list *Separator*, select the option *Semicolon*.
--

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Exporting the volume to limango
--

Imagine that you want to export the volume of variations to {market}. To do so, proceed like this:

. Create a property of the type *Decimal number* with the name *Volume*.
. Create a property of the type *Selection* with the name *Volume unit*.
. Add the units you need to the property *Volume unit* as property values. +
*_Note:_* Only the units l (for litres) and ml (for millilitres) can be exported.
. Open the limango catalogue.
. Map the marketplace data field *Volume* to the plentymarkets property *Volume*.
. To the right of this data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]).
. Map the property *Volume unit*. +
*_Tip:_* If you are sure that you only need one unit for all your variations, you can also export the unit by entering it as an own value. To do so, instead of mapping the property *Volume unit*, map the field *Own value* and enter the unit in the field that opens.
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. From the drop-down list *Separator*, select the option *Semicolon*.
--

| *Energy label URL*
| Lamps and luminaires with light sources not intended to be removed by the end-user must be labelled. As such, a URL of the energy label must be exported for these products.

*_Recommendation:_* Create a property of the type *Text* in which you save the URL to the energy label of a variation.

| *Energy data sheet URL*
| You need to provide an energy data sheet for all products that are subject to energy labelling law. As such, a URL of the energy data sheet must be exported for these products.

*_Recommendation:_* Create a property of the type *Text* in which you save the URL to the energy data sheet of a variation.

[#900]
== Setting up item data export

Item data is exported to limango via a catalogue format. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

To export your item data to limango, you need to create a catalogue. Link the limango data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to limango in regular intervals.

[#901]
=== Notes on the limango item data structure

The structure of limango item data differs from the structure in plentymarkets. The limango item data is categorised into three levels:

[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Level |Explanation

| *Product group*
| All products of the same model that are available in different colours. +
*_Tip:_* If a product is only available in a single style, then the product group and the variation are identical.

| *Product*
| A colour version of the product. As such, each product group has as many products as there are colours.

| *Variation*
| Variation at the size/EAN/SKU level +
*_Important:_* Each product must have at least one variation. +
*_Tip:_* If a product is only available in a single size, the size *Onesize* must be specified.
|====

[IMPORTANT]
.Use the parent-SKU
====
Do you sell products in different colours but manage these different colours in separate items? The parent SKU allows you to link these separate items. Parent SKUs can be saved for both items and individual variations. The manual maintenance of SKUs allows you to assign the Parent SKU of entirely different item variations to variations of an item.

* You can assign the Parent SKU of a variation which belongs to an entirely different item five times to an item with five variations. These variations are listed on limango as variations of the item with the Parent SKU they are assigned to. +
* If one variation has a different Parent SKU than the remaining variations of an item, then two different items are listed on limango. You only have to maintain one item in your plentymarkets system.
====

[#902]
=== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to limango via catalogue using the marketplace format *limango*. Create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogue* menu to export your items to limango. Map the limango data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards.

TIP: You can create only one catalogue for limango. Multiple catalogues are not supported for limango.

:catalogue-template-name: limango
:catalogue-plugin:

include::partial$catalogue-creation.adoc[]

[#903]
=== Mapping catalogue fields

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. This chapter describes how you map data fields and what particularities apply for item exports to limango. In addition, we provide recommendations for suitable mappings. This information is structured as follows:

=== Setting up automatic shipping confirmations

Shipping confirmations for limango must contain a tracking number. In addition, the shipping service provider of the order must be linked to the limango shipping service provider correctly in the plugin settings.

Create two event procedures to automatically confirm the shipping to limango:

* Event procedure 1: Send shipping confirmation to limango (<<#13002, How?>>)
* Event procedure 2: Book outgoing items (<<#13002, How?>>)

=== Setting up return management

Now set up the processing of returns for limango.

[#1010]
==== Workflow for returns

The delivery note also functions as the return form. The workflow of limango returns is as follows:

. Customers return the items to you.
. You process the return in plentymarkets.
. You notify limango when you have received the items.
. limango reimburses the customer. +
*_Note:_* When you notify limango that the return is completed, limango triggers a credit note and the buyer receives a refund. As such, only notify limango about completing the return after you have received and checked the returned items.

[#1030]
==== Automatically notify limango about completed returns

Set up an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedure] to automatically inform limango when you have completed processing a return.

:table-event-procedure: <<#event-procedure-returns-limango>>

== Shipping costs
