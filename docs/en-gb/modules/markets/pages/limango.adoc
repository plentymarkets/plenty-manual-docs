=== Saving mandatory variation information

As a minimum, you need to save the mandatory variation information to export your item data to limango. The following table shows the marketplace data fields that are mandatory for limango and how you save the necessary information in plentymarkets.

[cols="1,3a"]
|====
| Required | Setting in plentymarkets

| Product name
| Field *Name 1*, *Name 2*, or *Name 3* and either an attribute for colours or a property for colours

| Description
| Field *Item text*
Special case for selling shoes: field *Item text* + Material description

| Image URL +
| Pictures can only be processed in jpg format

| Material +
(only mandatory for products consisting of at least 80 % textiles)
| Properties of the type *Text*
//TODO: Add details from below

| RRP
| . Link a sales price of the price type *RRP* to the variations.
. Save a price.

| Gross sales price
| . Link a sales price with no price type to the variations. +
. Save a price.

| Category
| plentymarkets categories

| Brand
| . Save the manufacturer names in the menu *Setup » Item » Manufacturers*. +
. Select the manufacturer name for each variation.

| Gender
| . Create a property of the type *Selection* with the following values:
  ** Mann (men)
  ** Frau (women)
  ** Unisex
. Link the properties to a variation and select a value.

| Age group
| . Create a property with the following settings:
  ** Name: Age group
  ** Section: Item
  ** Type: Selection
  ** Selection values:
    ** Babys (babies)
    ** Kinder (children)
    ** Erwachsene (adults)
. In the menu *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Variation tab: Settings*, link the variation to the property.
. Select the property value that suits the variation.

| Colour
| If your variations were created without an attribute for colours:

. Create a property of the type *Selection* and save the necessary colours as property values.
. Link the properties to a variation and select a value. +
*_Tip:_* A property of the type *Selection* is a good idea if you work with recurring colour names.

_or_

. Create a property of the type *Text*.
. Link the properties to the variation and enter the colour. +
*_Tip:_* A property of the type *Text* may be more suitable if your colour range changes frequently. However, this increases the risk of typos.

| Size
| If your variations were created without an attribute for sizes:

. Create a property of the type *Selection* and save the necessary sizes as property values.
. Link the properties to a variation and select a value. +
*_Tip:_* A property of the type *Selection* is a good idea if you work with recurring size names.

_or_

. Create a property of the type *Text*.
. Link the properties to a variation and enter the size.

// Web API NOT required!

[#900]
== Setting up item data export

Item data is exported to limango via a catalogue format. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

To export your item data to limango, you need to create a catalogue. Link the limango data fields with the item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. After you activate the catalogue, the catalogue data is automatically exported to limango in regular intervals.

[#901]
=== Notes on the limango item data structure

The structure of limango item data differs from the structure in plentymarkets. The limango item data is categorised into three levels:

[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Level |Explanation

| *Product group*
| All products of the same model that are available in different colours. +
*_Tip:_* If a product is only available in a single style, then the product group and the variation are identical.

| *Product*
| A colour version of the product. As such, each product group has as many products as there are colours.

| *Variation*
| Variation at the size/EAN/SKU level +
*_Important:_* Each product must have at least one variation. +
*_Tip:_* If a product is only available in a single size, the size *Onesize* must be specified.
|====

[IMPORTANT]
.Use the parent-SKU
====
Do you sell products in different colours but manage these different colours in separate items? The parent SKU allows you to link these separate items. Parent SKUs can be saved for both items and individual variations. The manual maintenance of SKUs allows you to assign the Parent SKU of entirely different item variations to variations of an item.

* You can assign the Parent SKU of a variation which belongs to an entirely different item five times to an item with five variations. These variations are listed on limango as variations of the item with the Parent SKU they are assigned to. +
* If one variation has a different Parent SKU than the remaining variations of an item, then two different items are listed on limango. You only have to maintain one item in your plentymarkets system.
====

[#902]
=== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to limango via catalogue using the marketplace format *limango*. Create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogue* menu to export your items to limango. Map the limango data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

TIP: You can create only one catalogue for limango. Multiple catalogues are not supported for limango.

:catalogue-template-name: limango
:catalogue-plugin:

include::partial$catalogue-creation.adoc[]

[#903]
=== Mapping catalogue fields

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. This chapter describes how you map data fields and what particularities apply for item exports to limango. In addition, we provide recommendations for suitable mappings. This information is structured as follows:

* <<#907, Mapping data fields in the catalogue>>
* <<#905, Notes on mapping data fields>>
* <<#906, Recommendations for limango data field mapping>>

[#907]
==== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

Now, map the limango data fields to the item data saved in plentymarkets. Take note of the information regarding specific mappings and recommendations in this chapter.

include::partial$catalogue-mapping.adoc[]

[#905]
==== Notes on mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. <<#catalogue-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for limango.

[[catalogue-mappings]]
.Notes on mapping data fields
[cols="1,4a"]
|====
| Marketplace data field | plentymarkets data field

| *Description*
a|
[.collapseBox]
.Special case: Selling shoes
--
If you want to sell shoes on the market, all information regarding the material of your products must be exported to limango using the data field *Description*. To do this, you combine two plentymarkets data fields and export them as one filed to limango.

First, decide how you want to manage material information for your items. There are two ways to manage material information for limango:

* Enter the material information in the data field *Technical data* of the item.

_or_

* Create a property of the type *Text*. Link this property to the main variation of the item and manage the material information in this property.

Now, map the plentymarkets data field that you want in the catalogue:

. Map the plentymarkets data field that contains the item description to the marketplace data field *Description*.
. To the right of this data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]).
. Map the plentymarkets data field that contains the material information. +
*_Tip:_* This is either the field *Technical data* or the property that you created for the material information.
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. From the drop-down list *Separator*, select the option *Space*.
--

| Measurements +
(*Length*; +
*Width*; +
*Height*; +
*Volume*; +
*Diameter*; +
*Weight* +
etc.)
a| Measurements must be exported to limango with the format *[numeric value];[unit]*. Due to the limango product structure, the normal plentymarkets data fields for measurements cannot be mapped. Instead, create two properties:

* One property of the type *Decimal number* for the numerical value.
* One property of the type *Selection* for the unit with the following selection values:
  ** ml
  ** l
  ** mm
  ** cm
  ** m
  ** g
  ** kg

Combine these two properties, separated by a semicolon.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Exporting the length to limango
--
. Create a property of the type *Decimal number* with the name *Length*.
. Create a property of the type *Selection* with the name *Length unit*.
. Add the units you need to the property *Length unit* as property values.
. Open the limango catalogue.
. Map the marketplace data field *Length* to the plentymarkets property *Length*.
. To the right of this data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]).
. Map the property *Length unit*. +
*_Tip:_* If you are sure that you only need one unit for all your variations, you can also export the unit by entering it as an own value. To do so, instead of mapping the property *Length unit*, map the field *Own value* and enter the unit in the field that opens.
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. From the drop-down list *Separator*, select the option *Semicolon*.
--

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Exporting the volume to limango
--
. Create a property of the type *Decimal number* with the name *Volume*.
. Create a property of the type *Selection* with the name *Volume unit*.
. Add the units you need to the property *Volume unit* as property values. +
*_Note:_* Only the units l (for litres) and ml (for millilitres) can be exported.
. Open the limango catalogue.
. Map the marketplace data field *Volume* to the plentymarkets property *Volume*.
. To the right of this data field, click on *Add data field* (icon:link[rotate=90]).
. Map the property *Volume unit*. +
*_Tip:_* If you are sure that you only need one unit for all your variations, you can also export the unit by entering it as an own value. To do so, instead of mapping the property *Volume unit*, map the field *Own value* and enter the unit in the field that opens.
. To the right of the column, click on *Settings* (icon:cog[]).
. From the drop-down list *Separator*, select the option *Semicolon*.

| Material composition +
(*Sleeve lining*; +
*Upper 3*; +
*Upper 2*; +
*Upper 1*; +
*Membrane*; +
*Material 3* +
etc.)
a| Material information is exported to limango using a property of the type *Text*. Create a separate property for each marketplace data field.

The names of these properties must be identical to the values that limango allows:

* link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plentymarkets/manual/master/de/maerkte/assets/limango-material-composite-types.txt[Valid values for material composite types^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]

Link the properties to the main variation of the item and save all components of a material mix in this property. If the variations of the same item have different material mixes, deactivate the inheritance function for properties and save the material mixes separately for each variation. However, note that this deactivates the inheritance for all properties for the item. As such, you also need to manually manage all other properties for this item.

Specify the individual materials in descending order based on the percentage value. As such, the first material is the one with the highest percentage value, the last one that with the lowest percentage value. The sum of all percentages must be 100. You can specify as many materials as you need.
Enter the material composition in the following format:

* *{"materialtype1": "percentage","materialtype2": "percentage","materialtype3": "percentage"}* +
*_Example:_* `{"baumwolle": "90","elasthan": "10"}`

The values for material types must be identical to the values that limango allows:

* link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plentymarkets/manual/master/de/maerkte/assets/limango-material-types.txt[Valid values for material types^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Exporting material information for a blazer to limango
--
The following example shows you how to save material information for a blazer for the limango export.

[.instruction]
Mapping outer fabric and saving material mix for a variation:

. Create a property of the type *Text* with the name *obermaterial*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Upper* to the plentymarkets property *obermaterial*.
. Link the property *obermaterial* to the main variation of the item.
. Our blazer is made of 65% polyester, 32% rayon and 3% elastane. Enter the following into the text field of the property:
  * `{"polyester": "65","viskose": "32","elasthan": "3"}`
. Save the settings.

[.instruction]
Mapping lining and saving material mix for a variation:

. Create a property of the type *Text* with the name *futter*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Lining* to the plentymarkets property *futter*.
. Link the property *futter* to the main variation of the item.
. The lining of the blazer is made of 100% rayon. Enter the following into the text field of the property:
  * `{"viskose": "100"}`
. Save the settings.
--

| *Colour value*
| limango distinguishes by colours but not by shades. For example, if you offer a dress in both light and dark green, both are presented if customers search for green dresses on the market.

To ensure that different products are created for variations in different shades of the same colour, the colour value saved in plentymarkets is exported as part of the merchant product ID and the product name instead of the limango colour value.

[.collapseBox]
.*_Example:_* Mapping different shades of green to the colour value *green*
--
This example shows you how to map different shades of green to the colour value *green*.

[.instruction]
Assumed scenario:

You want to map all your shades of green to the limango colour value *green*.

The following shades of green are saved as values of the attribute *Colour*:

* Light green
* Dark green

The following shades of green are saved as property values:

* Lime green
* Coriander

[.instruction]
Mapping different shades of green to the colour value "green":

. Open the limango catalogue.
. Navigate to the area *Colour*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Colour* to the following plentymarkets data fields: +
*_Data field:_* Field *Value name* of the attribute for *Colour* +
*_Fallback data fields:_* Property for *Colour*
. Navigate to the area *Colour value*.
. Map the marketplace data field *Colour value: green* to the plentymarkets attribute value *Light green*.
. Click on *+ Add fallback data field*.
. As the first fallback data field, map the plentymarkets attribute value *Dark green*.
. Click on *+ Add fallback data field*.
. As the second fallback data field, map the plentymarkets property value *Lime green*.
. Click on *+ Add fallback data field*.
. As the third fallback data field, map the plentymarkets property value *Coriander*. +
→ The shade of green that is saved for the variation is exported as part of the merchant product ID and the product name. +
→ On limango, all products are listed with the colour Green. +
*_Tip:_* The order for mapping the different shades described here is random. You can map the values in any order.

=== Setting up automatic shipping confirmations

Shipping confirmations for limango must contain a tracking number. In addition, the shipping service provider of the order must be linked to the limango shipping service provider correctly in the plugin settings.

You need two event procedures to automatically confirm the shipping to limango:

* Event procedure 1: Send shipping confirmation to limango
* Event procedure 2: Book outgoing items

[#13001]
==== Workflow for automatic order confirmations

The workflow for automated shipping confirmations depends on whether or not the order’s shipping service provider is correctly linked to the limango shipping service provider in the plugin settings.

[cols="1,3a"]
|====
|Case |Procedure

| Shipping service provider linked
| * A package number is saved for the order.
* The event procedure *Send shipping confirmation to limango* checks if the shipping service provider is linked correctly.
* The procedure *Send shipping confirmation to limango* is triggered: A shipping confirmation is sent to limango.
* The order is moved to the status for *Order status for orders with shipping carrier mapping (> 5 - < 7)*.
* Only procedure 1 of the event procedure *Book outgoing items* is triggered. +
→ The outgoing items are booked. +
→ _No_ second shipping confirmation is sent to limango.

| Shipping service provider linked correctly
| * A package number is saved for the order.
* The event procedure *Send shipping confirmation to limango* checks if the shipping service provider is linked correctly.
* The order is moved to the status for *Order status for orders without shipping carrier mapping (> 5 - < 7)*.

=== Setting up return management

Now set up the processing of returns for limango.

[#1010]
==== Workflow for returns

The delivery note also functions as the return form. The workflow of limango returns is as follows:

. Customers return the items to you.
. You process the return in plentymarkets.
. You notify limango when you have received the items.
. limango reimburses the customer. +
*_Note:_* When you notify limango that the return is completed, limango triggers a credit note and the buyer receives a refund. As such, only notify limango about completing the return after you have received and checked the returned items.

[#1030]
==== Automatically notify limango about completed returns

Set up an xref:automation:event-procedures.adoc#[event procedure] to automatically inform limango when you have completed processing a return.

:table-event-procedure: <<#event-procedure-returns-limango>>

== Troubleshooting: Viewing log entries

NOTE: Your variations were not exported to limango? No variation data is exported if one or more variations do not meet the requirements of limango. As such, none of your variations will be exported to limango if one of your variations is invalid. To find the error, check the entries in the data log.
