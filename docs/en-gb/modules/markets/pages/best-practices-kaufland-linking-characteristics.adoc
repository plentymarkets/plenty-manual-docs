In order to list items on Kaufland.de successfully, plentymarkets transfers two files. One file contains the product data (product.csv) and the other file contains the offer data (inventory.csv). The product.csv is used to list the item. The inventory.csv is used to create the offer. Therefore, this file only contains information about price, stock, and shipping.

== How do I link a characteristic to a Kaufland.de attribute?

For various reasons, it might be useful to add specific attributes to the product data file. One reason is to provide the buyer with additional information about the item (material, colour etc.). Another reason is to transfer mandatory information which is required by law for specific products (danger notices, nutrition declarations etc.).

You can add this information by adding characteristics to the product data file. A new column is added to the product.csv for each characteristic that is linked to link:https://www.Kaufland.de/[Kaufland.de^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[]. +
*_Note:_* This procedure only works for the product.csv, but not for the inventory.csv.

== How do I add an attribute to the product.csv?

First of all, you have to find out the exact name of the column in the product data file. An overview of the attributes is provided on link:https://www.Kaufland.de/versandpartner/download-bereich/[Kaufland.de^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

For example, if you want to add the attribute "material composition" to the file, the corresponding characteristic must be named "material_composition".
Create the new characteristic in plentymarkets in the *Setup » Item » Characteristics* menu. The new characteristic will then appear in the CSV file. The characteristic must have the exact same name as the corresponding Kaufland.de attribute. In addition, you have to link the characteristic to Kaufland.de.

[[attributename]]
.Kaufland attribute name

[[marketplacelink]]
.link to Kaufland

Add the characteristic to the item and enter the corresponding value. The information will then be displayed in the file.

[[itemlink]]
.Linking the characteristic to the item

A new column is added to the product.csv afterwards.

*_Note:_* If two characteristics have the same name, then the characteristic with the lower ID will be overwritten. This way you can overwrite attributes which already exist by default (EAN, name etc.).
