|Setting |Explanation

|*Should we export item data to METRO?*
| Possible options: +
 Item export *On* or *Off*

*_Note:_* The item export runs once a day.
 Item data is not directly uploaded to your METRO back end. The CSV file exported by the plugin undergoes manual screening by METRO staff. You can check the status of uploaded files in your Metro dashboard. If issues are identified, you can download a report from the tab *Produkte aus METRO-Inventar verwalten* of your METRO seller account.

*_Important:_* METRO items are unique. The system does not allow duplicate entries. If you are the first uploader of an item, you become the sole manager of that item's details and specifications. If another seller uploads the same item, this only results in an *offer* for the item.

*_Note:_* Items for which you are not the owner only become visible in your METRO backend once you have submitted an offer for this item.

* Stock and prices of variations are updated based on the GTIN. Variations can only be updated if they have the same GTIN in both plentymarkets and on METRO.

* By default, stock and prices are updated by matching the plentymarkets GTIN to the identical GTIN on METRO. If you want to compare the SKU instead of the GTIN for updates, additional settings are required:
