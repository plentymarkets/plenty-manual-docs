Use the format *Basic Price Search Engine* to export item data for any price search engine. You can use it to map the item data expected by most price search engines.

TIP: Before setting up the export, you might want to check if plentymarkets or a third party provides a direct interface to the price search engine on which you want to sell your products. You can find additional integrations in the link::https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/sales/price-comparisons[plentyMarketplace].

== _Alternative 1:_ Export format BasicPriceSearchEngine-Plugin _(deprecated)_

NOTE: No new features are planned for the Elastic Export and the export formats. As such, we recommend that you <<#900, create catalogues instead>>.

In the past, the export format BasicPriceSearchEngine for the Elastic Export was used to export item data to price search engines. This export method is deprecated and has been replaced with the catalogue export. At the moment, you can still use the export format BasicPriceSearchEngine. However, this technology is no longer maintained and will not be supported for much longer.

=== Setting up the format BasicPriceSearchEngine-Plugin in plentymarkets

By installing this plugin, you will receive the export format *BasicPriceSearchEngine-Plugin*. Use this export format to transfer item data to price search engines via the elastic export. You also need to install the plugin *Elastic export* from the plentyMarketplace first before you can use the format in plentymarkets.

Once both plugins are installed in your plentymarkets system, you can create the export format *BasicPriceSearchEngine-Plugin*. For more information on export formats, see the <<data/exporting-data/elastic-export#, elastic export>> page.

[#catalogue-export]
== _Alternative 2:_ Catalogue export _(recommended)_

The export using catalogue formats provides you with a long-term and flexible way to export your items for price search engines. You create one catalogue for each price search engine. You can create export files in CSV or in TXT formats. To export your item data to a price search engine, send the URL of the catalogue download to the price search engine.

[#catalogue-creation]
=== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported using a marketplace format. To export your items to a price search engine, create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogue* menu. Link the data fields in the catalogue with item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards.

* Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, basic concept of the plentymarkets catalogues first>>.

:catalogue-template-name: Basic Price Search Engine
:format-item-new:

include::../_textblocks/catalogues/instructions/catalogue-creation.adoc[]

[#file-format]
=== Carrying out the format settings

Now carry out the format settings. This marketplace format allows you to export item data either as a CSV file or a TXT file. Select other format settings, such as field separators or text delimiters, based on the requirements of the price search engine.

* Check the page <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#140, Managing catalogues>> to find out more about the format settings.

[#data-field-mappings]
=== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

Now, map the data fields in the catalogue to the item data saved in plentymarkets.
