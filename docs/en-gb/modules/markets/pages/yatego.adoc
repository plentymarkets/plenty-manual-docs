| *Shipping costs*
a| * *Add up shipping charges for each item* = For every item, plentymarkets transfers the shipping costs (domestic) that are valid for the plentyShop.

In addition, the shipping costs that are saved in Yatego are added to the shipping costs that were transferred by plentymarkets. +
* *Add up, but only once for multiple copies of the same item* = plentymarkets also transfers the shipping costs (domestic) that are valid for the plentyShop. The shipping charges are added when purchasing various items. When purchasing two or more of the same item, the shipping charge is only calculated once. Finally, this is also added to the extra shipping charges saved for Yatego. +
* *Use Yatego table of shipping charges based on the item weight* = If you select this option, plentymarkets does not transfer any shipping costs to Yatego. Based on the weight which is saved in plentymarkets and which is also transferred to Yatego, Yatego calculates the shipping costs itself.

== Automatically transmitting items

Go to *Setup » Markets » Yatego » Settings* to carry out the item exchange with Yatego. The functions in this menu are only available after having entered the access data. The preview function allows you to check the data before the transfer takes place. The Yatego import can take a long time. plentymarkets has no control over this.

In order to ensure a smooth item export, make sure that the access data for the Yatego shop are correct and valid.

[WARNING]
.Full Yatego import
====
With plentymarkets, you always need to transfer entire data sets to Yatego. This means that all items already existing in Yatego have to be deleted before a new import is carried out. If you already have items in your Yatego account, make sure that you create the same items in plentymarkets first before you allow for the items to be exported to Yatego.
====

[.instruction]
Transmitting items to Yatego:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Yatego » Settings*.

. Click on the corresponding *preview icon* to check the data that is made available as a CSV file.
. After checking the data, click on *Transmit data* to transfer the data to Yatego.

[#800]
== Importing orders

Orders are transferred directly from Yatego if the plentymarkets system with an SSL certificate was booked. The transfer of orders from Yatego to plentymarkets takes place with an encoded connection only. An SSL certificate is necessary for this. If no SSL certificate was booked, this has to be done later.

[TIP]
.Tipp: Book SSL certificate
====
To book an SSL certificate, go to *Setup » Client » [Open client] » SSL*. In the row *Order new SSL for domain: [domain name]*, click on the down arrow to the right.
====

////
If you have an SSL certificate, you have to carry out some settings in the Yatego back end under *yatego.com » Bestellungen » Bestellanbindungen* and incoming orders will be transferred to plentymarkets. Make sure to enter the correct URL including *https://*, for example *https:www.mein-shop.de/*.

[IMPORTANT]
.Item export for further online shops
====
If the item export is set up for another client (online store), enter the access data from the main system (URL and SSL ceritifcate and *web token* from the plentymarkets API data) (WebToken = not *plentyToken*). +
The *web token* can be found in plentymarkets in the *System » System settings » API » Data* menu in the *web token* area.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Shipping confirmation
====
The shipping confirmation is not sent to Yatego automatically. The order must be confirmed manually at Yatego.

== FAQ

[.collapseBox]
.How does plentymarkets transmit variations that are not limited to stock to Yatego?
--
The stock limitation is set in the *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Tab: Settings » Area: Visibility* menu. Variations for which the option *Limitation* is set to *None* or *Do not administer stock for this variation* are also transferred to Yatego. plentymarkets sends a value of *-1* for these variations, so that Yatego knows that these variations can be bought without limitation.
--

[.collapseBox]
.Can I manually import orders from Yatego to plentymarkets?
--
Yes. If a Yatego order is manually transferred to plentymarkets from Yatego, then Yatego does not send an item ID or variation ID (attribute_value_set_id). This makes it impossible for the item to be assigned and the item is imported with the item ID -2 (unknown item). Unassigned items are flagged by a *green plus icon* in the order. The item then has to be assigned manually.
--

[.collapseBox]
.How do I know that the customer has already paid the order?
--
Yatego neither sends a transaction ID for payments nor other information that indicates whether the order was paid for or not. Therefore, the Yatego settings include an option that allows you to set orders to be booked for some payment methods: *Set all orders in status 5 to booked*. Select this option if the payment method ensures that payment was already made when the order is booked.
--

[.collapseBox]
.The link for the item in the order does not work. What can I do?
--
Yatego sends a link for the orders, which directly connects to the item on the Yatego platform. Usually, this link doesn't work, because Yatego adds "yatego.com" to the name of the online shop. Delete "yatego.com" from the link and then it will work correctly. +
*_Example:_* http://www.yatego.com/SHOPNAME.yatego.com/p,4fcaaf8c8292c,461e2919becf22_4 +
*_The correct format is:_* http://www.yatego.com/SHOPNAME/p,4fcaaf8c8292c,461e2919becf22_4
--

[.collapseBox]
.I set up Yatego in plentymarkets. Why are my orders not transferred?
--
The first time that an online shop activates the Yatego order process for plentymarkets, it is common that the first two to three orders will not be automatically transferred to plentymarkets. These orders have to be manually triggered again from within the Yatego system.
--

[.collapseBox]
.I would like to offer an item with attributes. Why does Yatego not display the stock correctly?
--
Yatego is not able to process the warehouse data records that plentymarkets sends for items if there are more than 999 possible combinations of attributes. As such, all possible combinations of variations are activated for the item and set to endless stock (meaning that stock doesn't exist for Yatego). If you need to use a large number of attributes, contact Yatego before exporting the corresponding items.
--

[.collapseBox]
.Why does Yatego not immediately edit the CSV files I transferred?
--
The CSV files that are transferred to Yatego each day are not imported and edited immediately, but rather have to wait in line to be processed. Therefore, the import and editing process can take several hours. You can go to Yatego and check where your file is in line.
