[#etsy-backend-settings]
== Settings in Etsy back end

Carry out the following settings in your Etsy account before you set up the market in plentymarkets:

* In the Etsy back end, go to *Shop-Manager » Listings » [Open listing]* and set the setting *Renewal options* to *Manual*. Otherwise, the setup will not work correctly.
* Create shipping profiles on Etsy.

[#market-setup]
== Setting up the market in plentymarkets

====

[#activate-account]
=== Activating your Etsy account

First, the interface to Etsy has to be activated in the *Setup » Markets » Etsy » OAuth2* menu. This is to grant plentymarkets access to your Etsy account and to enable the data exchange between plentymarkets and Etsy.

[IMPORTANT]
.*Authentication* menu is deprecated
====
The authentication in the *Setup » Markets » Etsy » Authentication* menu is deprecated and without function. Thus, you do not have to carry out any settings here. However, it is important that you authenticate your Etsy account for OAuth2 in the *Setup » Markets » Etsy » OAuth2* menu.
====

[.instruction]
Activating the interface:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Etsy » OAuth2*.

// Web API NOT required!

[#550]
=== _Optional:_Saving existing Etsy listing IDs

[#910]
== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to Etsy via catalogues. The marketplace format *Listing - Etsy* creates a catalogue for exporting data for all Etsy product categories.

[#700]
=== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to Etsy via catalogue using the marketplace format *Listing - Etsy*. To export your items to Etsy, create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogue* menu. Link the Etsy data fields with item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. The catalogue data is automatically exported to Etsy once a day if you have activated the *Item export* in the *Setup » Markets » Etsy » Settings* menu.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

TIP: You can create only one catalogue for Etsy. Multiple catalogues are currently not supported for Etsy.

:catalogue-template-name: Listing
:etsy:

include::partial$catalogue-creation.adoc[]

[#903]
=== Mapping catalogue fields

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. This chapter describes how you map data fields and what particularities apply for item exports to Etsy. In addition, we provide recommendations for suitable mappings. This information is structured as follows:

* <<#map-data-fields, Mapping data fields in the catalogue>>
* <<#905, Notes on mapping data fields>>
* <<#906, Recommendations for Etsy data field mapping>>

[#map-data-fields]
==== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. Check the documentation of the sales channel to find out what data the market expects for the individual data fields.

include::partial$catalogue-mapping.adoc[]

[#905]
==== Notes on mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. As such, there are some particularities for each market when mapping data fields. <<#catalogue-etsy-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for Etsy.

[[catalogue-etsy-mappings]]
.Notes on mapping data fields
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Marketplace data field | plentymarkets data field

| *Shop sections*
| For this marketplace data field, all shop sections that you created on Etsy are available.

| *Occasion*; +
*Recipient*
| If you only use the export language "German", export the values in German. If you use other export languages, either in addition to or instead of German, export the values in English.

| *Who made it?* (who_made); +
*When was it made?* (when_made); +
*A supply or tool to make things?* (is_supply)
| The combination of these three marketplace data fields determines if a product can be sold on Etsy:

* Products must be either made by you, vintage (older than 20 years) or they must be supply/tools.

This results in the following rules for the export:

* If *who_made* is "someone_else" and *is_supply* is "false", then *when_made* must be at least 20 years ago.
* If *who_made* is "someone_else" and *when_made* is less than 20 years ago, then *is_supply* must be "true".

| _Price information_
| You cannot export any strikethrough prices to Etsy using plentymarkets. In other words: You cannot visualise price reductions on Etsy where the old price is shown but crossed out.
