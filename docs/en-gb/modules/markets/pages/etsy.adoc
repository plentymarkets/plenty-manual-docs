== Installing the Etsy plugin in plentymarkets

You need a plugin to link plentymarkets to Etsy. To connect to limango in plentymarkets, install the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/sales/marktplaetze/etsy_4689[Etsy plugin^] in your plentymarkets system. You can download the plugin in the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

:plugin: Etsy
include::_textblocks/instructions/plugin-installation.adoc[]

[#250]
== Activating the interface

First, the interface has to be activated in the *Setup » Markets » Etsy » Authentication* menu. This grants plentymarkets access to your Etsy account.

[.instruction]
Activating the interface:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Etsy » Authentication*.
. Click on the globe icon (icon:globe[role="green"]). +
→ A new window opens and you are forwarded to Etsy. +
*_Troubleshooting:_* You are not redirected?
Then deactivate your pop-up blocker or try a different browser.
. Enter your Etsy access data.
. Click on *Allow access*. +
→ plentymarkets can access your Etsy account. +
→ You can continue the setup. +
*_Troubleshooting:_* Are you redirected to the start page of your plentyShop? Then your plentyShop is probably locked. +
Go to *Setup » Client » Standard » Online store » Lock store* to unlock your plentyShop. Unlock the store. Once the authentication is completed, go back to lock the store.

[#300]
== Setting up Etsy in plentymarkets

[IMPORTANT]
.Pay attention to the Renewal options at Etsy
====
Prior to setting up Etsy in plentymarkets, you have to set the setting *Renewal options* to *Manual* in the *Shop-Manager » Listings » [Open listing]* menu of the Etsy back end. Otherwise, the Etsy plugin will not work correctly.
====

Go to *Setup » Markets » Etsy » Settings* to activate the data exchange.

[.instruction]
Activating the data exchange:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Etsy » Settings*.
. In the *Processes* area, activate the *Item export*, *Stock update*, and *Order import*.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#301]
== Setting up export languages

In the *Export languages* area, you carry out settings for export languages. The *Shop language* is exported by default. Other languages are used for translations of your offers.

[.instruction]
Setting up export languages:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Etsy » Settings*.
. Activate the languages that you want to export for your offers. The following languages are available:
  ** English
  ** German
  ** French
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings. +
*_Note:_* The *Shop language* that you set is exported irrespective of these settings.

[#400]
== Activating the order referrer

:market: Etsy
:referrer: Etsy
:referrer-option: pass:quotes[option *Etsy*]

include::_textblocks/instructions/activate-referrer.adoc[]

[#500]
== Setting the variation availability

:market-availability: Etsy
:option-availability: Etsy

include::_textblocks/instructions/variation-availability.adoc[]

// Web API NOT required!

[#550]
== _Optional:_Saving existing Etsy listing IDs

If you already sell a variation on Etsy, save the Etsy listing ID as an SKU for the referrer *Etsy*. By doing so, variations will be assigned to the variations already listed on Etsy during the item export. This is to prevent overselling. +

[.instruction]
Saving an Etsy listing-ID:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Variation tab: Settings*.
. Click on the *Availability* tab.
. In the *SKU* area, click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The *New SKU* window opens.
. Select the referrer *Etsy*.
. Enter the *SKU* in the following format: +
  _[Etsy listing ID]_-_[plentymarkets variation ID]_ +
  *_Example:_* 708093072-3467
. Enter the *Parent SKU* in the following format: +
  _[Etsy Listing-ID]_ +
  *_Example:_* 708093072
. Click on *Add* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]). +
→ The SKU is saved and displayed.

[#600]
== Defining a sales price

:referrer-price: Etsy

include::_textblocks/instructions/define-sales-price.adoc[]

[#900]
== Saving legal information

The item texts for Etsy offers must contain specific legal information, for example relating to delivery time and cancellation rights. Save this in formation in all languages in which you offer your products. The legal information is automatically added to the item description during the export.

[.instruction]
Saving legal information:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Etsy » Legal information*. +
→ The window *Legal information* opens.
. Select the language in which you want to save legal information.
. Enter the text.
. Save (icon:save[set=plenty]) the settings.

[#910]
== Setting up the item export

Item data is exported to Etsy via catalogues. The marketplace format *Listing - Etsy* creates a catalogue for exporting data for all Etsy product categories.

[#700]
=== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to Etsy via catalogue using the marketplace format *Listing - Etsy*. To export your items to Etsy, create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogue* menu. Link the Etsy data fields with item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards. The catalogue data is automatically exported to Etsy once a day if you have activated the *Item export* in the *Setup » Markets » Etsy » Settings* menu.

* Is this your first time working with catalogues? Then read up on the <<en/data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues, basic concept of the plentymarkets catalogues first>>.

TIP: You can create only one catalogue for Etsy. Multiple catalogues are currently not supported for Etsy.

:catalogue-template-name: Listing - Etsy

include::_textblocks/catalogues/instructions/catalogue-creation.adoc[]

[#903]
=== Mapping catalogue fields

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. This chapter describes how you map data fields and what particularities apply for item exports to Etsy. In addition, we provide recommendations for suitable mappings. This information is structured as follows:

* <<#907, Mapping data fields in the catalogue>>
* <<#905, Notes on mapping data fields>>
* <<#906, Recommendations for Etsy data field mapping>>

[#map-data-fields]
==== Mapping data fields in the catalogue

After you have created a catalogue, map the market's data fields to item data saved in plentymarkets. Check the documentation of the sales channel to find out what data the market expects for the individual data fields.

[TIP]
.Using properties
====
Use <<item/managing-items#500, properties>> to export values for marketplace data fields that have no corresponding field in plentymarkets.
====

include::_textblocks/catalogues/instructions/catalogue-mapping.adoc[]

[#905]
==== Notes on mapping data fields

Every market structures item data differently. As such, there are some particularities for each market when mapping data fields. <<#catalogue-etsy-mappings>> contains mapping information for important data fields for Etsy.

[[catalogue-etsy-mappings]]
.Notes on mapping data fields
[cols="1,3a"]
|====
| Marketplace data field | plentymarkets data field

| *Shop sections*
| For this marketplace data field, all shop sections that you created on Etsy are available.

| *Occasion*; +
*Recipient*
| If you only use the export language "German", export the values in German. If you use other export languages, either in addition to or instead of German, export the values in English.

| *Who made it?* (who_made); +
*When was it made?* (when_made); +
*A supply or tool to make things?* (is_supply)
| The combination of these three marketplace data fields determines if a product can be sold on Etsy:

* Products must be either made by you, vintage (older than 20 years) or they must be supply/tools.

This results in the following rules for the export:

* If *who_made* is "someone_else" and *is_supply* is "false", then *when_made* must be at least 20 years ago.
* If *who_made* is "someone_else" and *when_made* is less than 20 years ago, then *is_supply* must be "true".

[#906]
==== Recommendations for data field mappings

To help you with mapping your data fields for the {market} catalogue, we have created a list of recommended data field mappings. Note that these mappings are recommendations only. Depending on how you manage your item data, other mappings may be more appropriate than the recommendation given here.
