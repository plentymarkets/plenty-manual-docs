==== Offer and product export at Check24

Check24 differentiates between offer data and product data. Therefore, there are two different exports for Check24: the offer export and the product export. +

* The catalogue format *Check24 Offer* is used for the offer export.
* The catalogue format *Check24* is used for the product export.

*_Note:_* Additionally, there is also the format *Check24 Fashion* which can be used for Check24. However, as the fashion category is not in use any longer on Check24, the format is deprecated and should therefore only be used as an exception and in consultation with Check24.

Check24 retrieves item data via an URL. You will find this URL in your Check24 catalogue in the *Data » Catalogues* menu. You have to save the URL in the Check24 backend so that item data can be exported to Check24. +
*_Note:_* As there are two exports, the offer export (catalogue format *Check24 Offer*), and the product export (catalogue format *Check24*), there are also two URLs via which item data is retrieved by Check24. However, you can only save _one_ URL at Check24. You should therefore <<#url-check24-catalogue, save the URL for the _offer export_ (catalogue format *Check24 Offer*) at Check24>>. +
You cannot save the URL for the product export (catalogue format *Check24*) at Check24 yourself. Reach out to your Check24 contact person. They will save the product export URL in your contact data.

[#500]
=== _Alternative 1:_ Elastic Export _(old method)_

This section explains how to transfer your items to Check24. In the old plugin, the item export for Check24DE is carried out by the elastic export. The data format Check24 is used for this.

NOTE: No new features are planned for the Elastic Export and the export format for Check24. As such, we recommend that you <<#900, create catalogues for Check24 instead>>.

==== Installing plugins for the Elastic Export

:price-search-engine: to Check24 with the Elastic Export
:plugin-name: Check24
:plugin-link: https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/elasticexportcheck24de_4730

include::partial$plugin-download.adoc[]

First, create the export format *Check24DE-Plugin*. Then transfer the URL to Check24.

*_Note:_* In addition, there is the export format *Check24DE Fashion*. However, this export format is deprecated, as the fashion category is not in use any longer on Check24. You should therefore only use the export format *Check24DE Fashion* as an exception and only in consultation with Check24.

[#500-1]
==== Export format Check24DE

Create the export format *Check24DE-Plugin* as described below. Note the following points:

* If you change one or more settings, then you will have to transfer the new link to Check24.
* A maximum of 4000 items is exported at once. If you export more items, then a second export is automatically carried out. To display the second export process, set the parameter *&Page* = in the export link to *2*.
* Technical data is transferred to Check24 in the last column of the export file.

[.instruction]
.Creating the export format Check24DE-Plugin:

. Go to *Data » Elastic export*.
. Click on *New export*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#settings-item-export-check24>>. +
*_Important:_* If you change one or more settings, then you will have to transfer the new link to Check24.

→ The export format is given an ID. +
→ The export format is shown in the *Exports* overview.
