=== _Alternative 1:_ Elastic Export _(deprecated)_

This section explains how to transfer your items to Check24. In the old plugin, the item export for Check24DE is carried out by the elastic export. The data formats Check24DE and Check24DE Fashion are used for this.

NOTE: No new features are planned for the Elastic Export and the export formats for Check24. As such, we recommend that you <<#900, create catalogues for Check24 instead>>.

==== Installing plugins for the Elastic Export

:price-search-engine: to Check24 with the Elastic Export
:plugin-name: Check24
:plugin-link: https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/elasticexportcheck24de_4730

First, create the export format Check24DE. Then transfer the URL to Check24.
