==== Offer and product export at Check24

Check24 differentiates between offer data and product data. Therefore, there are two different exports for Check24: the offer export and the product export. +

* The catalogue format *Check24 Offer* is used for the offer export.
* The catalogue format *Check24* is used for the product export.

*_Note:_* Additionally, there is also the format *Check24 Fashion* which can be used for Check24. However, as the fashion category is not in use any longer on Check24, the format is deprecated and should therefore only be used as an exception and in consultation with Check24.

Check24 retrieves item data via an URL. You will find this URL in your Check24 catalogue in the *Data » Catalogues* menu. You have to save the URL in the Check24 backend so that item data can be exported to Check24. +
*_Note:_* As there are two exports, the offer export (catalogue format *Check24 Offer*), and the product export (catalogue format *Check24*), there are also two URLs via which item data is retrieved by Check24. However, you can only save _one_ URL at Check24. You should therefore <<#url-check24-catalogue, save the URL for the _offer export_ (catalogue format *Check24 Offer*) at Check24>>. +
You cannot save the URL for the product export (catalogue format *Check24*) at Check24 yourself. Reach out to your Check24 contact person. They will save the product export URL in your contact data.

[#catalogue-export]
=== _Alternative 1:_ Catalogue export _(recommended method)_

You can now export item data to Check24 using catalogue formats. Go to *Data » Catalogues* to create catalogues.

include::partial$catalogue-new-to-text.adoc[]

[#catalogue-formats-check24]
==== Catalogue formats for Check24

For Check24, there are different catalogue formats:

* *Check24*: This catalogue format contains product data.
* *Check24 Offer*: This catalogue format contains offer data.
* *Check24 Furniture*: This catalogue format contains item data for the Check24 product category *Furniture*.
* *Check24 Fashion*: This catalogue format is deprecated, as the fashion category is not in use any longer on Check24. It should only be used as an exception and in consultation with Check24.

For further information about the different formats, refer to the <<#check24-offer-product-exports, Offer and product export at Check24>> chapter.

[#catalogue-creation]
==== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported to Check24 via catalogue using the marketplace format *Check24*. To export your items to Check24, create catalogues in the *Data » Catalogue* menu. Link the Check24 data fields with item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards.

Check24 retrieves item data via an URL. You will find this URL in your Check24 catalogue in the *Data » Catalogues* menu. After you created the catalogue, you have to <<#url-check24-catalogue, copy the URL and save it at Check24>> so that item data can be exported to Check24.

Copy the URL of the catalogue in the *Data » Catalogues* menu and save it in the Check24 backend afterwards. +
*_Note:_* You have to save the URL of the catalogue format *Check24 Offer* for the offer export at Check24. You cannot save the URL for the product export (catalogue format *Check24*) at Check24 yourself. Reach out to your Check24 contact person. They will save the product export URL in your contact data.

[.instruction]
Copying the URL:

. Go to *Data » Catalogues*. +

. Click on the catalogue for the format *Check24 Offer*. +
→ The catalogue opens.
. In the navigation on the left, open the tab *Settings* (material:settings[]).
. Under *Download settings* in the *Options for public link* section, click on *Copy URL* (material:content_copy[]).
→ The URL is copied to the clipboard.
. Save the URL in the Check24 back end.

[#500]
=== _Alternative 2:_ Item export with the Elastic Export _(old method)_

This section explains how to transfer your items to Check24. In the old plugin, the item export for Check24DE is carried out by the elastic export. The data format Check24 is used for this.

NOTE: No new features are planned for the Elastic Export and the export format for Check24. As such, we recommend that you <<#catalogue-export, create catalogues for Check24 instead>>.

==== Installing plugins for the Elastic Export

:price-search-engine: to Check24 with the Elastic Export
:plugin-name: Check24
:plugin-link: https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/elasticexportcheck24de_4730

include::partial$plugin-download.adoc[]

First, create the export format *Check24DE-Plugin*. Then transfer the URL to Check24.

*_Note:_* In addition, there is the export format *Check24DE Fashion*. However, this export format is deprecated, as the fashion category is not in use any longer on Check24. You should therefore only use the export format *Check24DE Fashion* as an exception and only in consultation with Check24.

[#500-1]
==== Export format Check24DE

Create the export format *Check24DE-Plugin* as described below. Note the following points:

* If you change one or more settings, then you will have to transfer the new link to Check24.
* A maximum of 4000 items is exported at once. If you export more items, then a second export is automatically carried out. To display the second export process, set the parameter *&Page* = in the export link to *2*.
* Technical data is transferred to Check24 in the last column of the export file.

*_Note:_* Create the export format *Check24DE Fashion* in the same way. However, note that the format is deprecated and should therefore only be used as an exception and in consultation with Check24.

[.instruction]
.Creating the export format Check24DE-Plugin:

. Go to *Data » Elastic export*.
. Click on *New export*.
. Carry out the settings. Pay attention to the explanations given in <<#settings-item-export-check24>>. For *Check24 Fashion*, see <<#settings-item-export-check24-fashion>>. +
*_Important:_* If you change one or more settings, then you will have to transfer the new link to Check24.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The export format is given an ID. +
→ The export format is shown in the *Exports* overview.

[#check24-delete-items]
== Removing items from Check24

Offers will only be visible on Check24 if a variation has at least one active offer. If a variation is not contained in the offer export or is exported to Check24 with a stock of *0*, then there will be no offer for this variation on Check24. +
Check24 recommends that you remove variations from the offer export rather than export a stock of *0* if you do not want to sell a variation on Check24 any more. To remove variations from the offer export, deactivate the availability for the market in the variation as described below.

Thus, variations cannot be sold on Check24 if they do not have stock in plentymarkets. The offer for the variation on Check24 will be removed from Check24 if a stock of *0* is exported. The interval for the data exchange is defined in the <<#catalogue-settings, catalogue settings>>.
If the variation is in stock again, then it will also be offered on Check24 after the next item data export.

If you do not want to sell a variation which is in stock in plentymarkets on Check24, then you have to delete the availability for the market. 

[.instruction]
Deleting the availability:

. Go to *Item » Edit item » [Open item] » [Open variation] » Variation tab: Availability*.
. *Delete* (icon:minus-circle[role="red"]) the availability *Check24*.
. *Save* (terra:save[]) the settings. +
→ The variation will not be offered on Check24 any longer.
