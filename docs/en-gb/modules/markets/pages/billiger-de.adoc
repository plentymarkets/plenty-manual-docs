[#catalogue-export]
=== _Alternative 1:_ Item export with catalogue formats _(recommended method)_

Catalogue formats provide you with a long-term and flexible way to export your item data to {market}.

[#catalogue-creation]
==== Creating a catalogue

Item data is exported using a marketplace format. To export your items to a price search engine, create a catalogue in the *Data » Catalogue* menu. Link the data fields in the catalogue with item data saved in plentymarkets in the marketplace format afterwards.
