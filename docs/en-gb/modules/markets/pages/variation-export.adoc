The Amazon catalogue is here! Amazon is the first big market to be offered for variation export via catalogues. However, if you prefer you can still use the old export.

[#100]
== Why catalogues?

* Your catalogues will quickly become your control centre for all variation exports.
* The catalogue provides the data structure of the flatfile. As such, you know exactly which variation data is necessary to sell your products on Amazon.
* You decide what variation data is exported for each flatfile and each platform. At the same time, suggestions help you to set up additional catalogues more quickly: Because once you have mapped a marketplace data field to a plentymarkets field, this mapping is suggested to you next time.
* You can transmit data more flexibly because you can map fields in any way you like.

[IMPORTANT]
.Amazon catalogues are a new feature!
====
Catalogues for exporting variation data to Amazon are a new feature.

[#200]
== Important information on Amazon catalogues

* A separate catalogue is created for each combination of an Amazon account, an Amazon platform and a flatfile. +
*_Note:_* If Amazon releases a new version of the flatfile, a new catalogue needs to be created. The good news is: You can <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#80, copy and edit>> the catalogue with the old flatfile version with a few convenient clicks.
* Characteristics and free text fields cannot be transmitted to Amazon in catalogues. You can create properties for the mandatory field of a flatfile in the assistant for the Amazon catalogue. You can create and map additional properties at any time.
* A separate flatfile exists for Amazon Business (B2B). As such, you need to create a separate catalogue for Amazon Business.
* BMVD export categories are ignored in the catalogues.
* All mandatory fields of the flatfile are mapped in the assistant. You can map additional fields in the *Data » Catalogues* menu after the catalogue is created.
* Do you already sell on Amazon and export variation data to the market? When you activate an Amazon catalogue for one combination of Amazon account, Amazon platform and flatfile, the old variation export for this combination is deactivated automatically.

[#300]
== Important preparation

* Set up the Amazon accounts you need. To do so, follow the steps described on the <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#, Setting up Amazon>> page of the manual.
* Then prepare your variations for exporting them to Amazon. The <<markets/amazon/preparing-variations#, Preparing variations>> page will tell you how.
* Before you create your first Amazon catalogue, familiarise yourself with <<data/exporting-data/managing-catalogues#, how catalogues are used in plentymarkets>>.

[#400]
== Creating a catalogue for variation export

Amazon catalogues are created with the *Creating catalogues - Amazon* assistant in the *Setup » Assistants » Omni-Channel* menu.

* A separate catalogue is created for each combination of an Amazon account, an Amazon platform and a flatfile.
* All mandatory fields of the flatfile are mapped in the assistant.
* Optional fields are mapped in the *Data » Catalogue* menu once the catalogue has been created.
* Amazon catalogues can only be created in the assistant, not in the *Data » Catalogue* menu.

[IMPORTANT]
.Free text fields and characteristics are not supported
====
Catalogues do not support free text fields or characteristics. Only properties can be transmitted to Amazon in catalogues. You can create properties for all mandatory fields of a flatfile in the assistant.
====

=== Creating a catalogue in the assistant

The assistant *Create catalogues - Amazon* allows you to create a catalogue for exporting your variation data to Amazon in a few easy steps. You specify a name for the catalogue and decide on the flatfiles and the Amazon platform to use. You also map all mandatory fields in the catalogue.

[TIP]
.One catalogue per account, plattform and flatfile
====
You need a separate catalogue for each combination of Amazon account, Amazon platform and flatfile. This is made easy thanks to suggestions: Because once you have mapped a marketplace data field to a plentymarkets field, this mapping is suggested to you next time.

.Step *User account*
--
Select the amazon account from the drop-down list. You need to create a separate catalogue for each combination of one Amazon account, one Amazon platform and one Amazon flatfile. You can only select Amazon accounts that are already saved in your plentymarkets system. If the account is not shown, go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Settings* and create a <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#300, new account>> or use the assistant *Base settings - Amazon*.

*_Note:_* Create <<crm/managing-contacts#15, the necessary customer classes>> in advance if they do not already exist in your plentymarkets system.

|Setting |Explanation

| *Name*
| Enter a name for the catalogue. If no name is entered, a name is generated automatically.

| *Activate item export*
| Activates the export. The export is deactivated by default. +
*_Note:_* Check all mappings before activating the export. You can also activate the catalogue later in the *Data » Catalogue* menu.

| *Fulfilment method*
a| Select if only MFN variations, only FBA variations or both are to be exported in this catalogue. +

* *Transmit MFN and FBA variations* (default setting) = MFN variations and FBA variations are transmitted (recommended). +
* *Only transmit MFN variations* = Only variations that you ship yourself are transmitted. As such, a separate catalogue must be created for FBA variations. +
* *Only transmit FBA variations* = Only variations shipped by Amazon are transmitted. As such, you need to create a separate catalogue for variations that you ship yourself. +
*_Tip:_* We recommend that you manage both fulfilment methods in a single catalogue.

| *Amazon flatfile*
| Select the flatfile to use for this catalogue. +
A flatfile is a file template for specific product categories provided by Amazon. This file template specifies the variation and stock data that needs to be exported to Amazon. +
*_Note:_* Only flatfiles for platforms that are activated for the Amazon account that you selected in step 1 are shown. If necessary, activate <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#300, additional platforms for the Amazon account>>.

| *Amazon platform* +
(only shown once a flatfile is selected)
| Select the Amazon platform from the drop-down list. +
*_Note:_* Only Amazon platforms that are activated for the Amazon account that you selected in step 1 are shown. If necessary, activate <<markets/amazon/amazon-setup#300, additional platforms for the Amazon account>>.

.Step *Setting up the catalogue*
--
In this step, you map plentymarkets data fields with the data fields of the selected Amazon flatfile. All data fields shown in this step are mandatory fields and need to be mapped. You can map additional fields in the *Data » Catalogue* menu after you completed the assistant.

TIP: If you have created a catalogue for Amazon already, data fields are shown as suggestions in every catalogue after that. For each marketplace data field, the plentymarkets data field that you mapped to this field most often is suggested.

*Create property* = Creates a new property and maps this property to the data field. The properties are grouped in the property group *Amazon Catalog* of the *Setup » Settings » Properties » Groups* menu. The name of the property is based on the field in the flatfile.

'''
*Create price* = Creates a sales price and maps this sales price to the data field. Automatically created sales prices can be checked and edited in the *Setup » Item » Sales prices* menu. The name of the sales price carries the prefix "Amazon Catalogue".

'''
*Create barcode* = Creates a new barcode and maps this barcode to the data field. Automatically created barcodes can be checked and edited in the *Setup » Item » Barcodes* menu.

'''
*Select data field* = A data field in plentymarkets is transmitted to Amazon. Select the data field from the drop-down list *Select data field*. +
*_Note:_* Fields with the option *Map data field manually* cannot be mapped in the assistant. You need to map these fields manually after the catalogue has been created.

'''
*Manually map data field* = These fields are not mapped automatically in the assistant. You need to map these data fields manually after the catalogue has been created.

=== Mapping additional data fields (not in assistant)

You have already mapped important mandatory fields for the flatfile in the assistant. You need to map additional data fields after you completed the assistant. You can also map additional fields to send even more information about your products to Amazon.

== Exporting the Amazon catalogue to a CSV file

You can download the catalogue before transmitting the data to Amazon, for example to check the mappings you created. You can export up to 30,000 variations. If you have more variations, you can filter them by item ID, tag ID and/or manufacturer.

[.instruction]
Exporting the Amazon catalogue to a CSV file:

. Go to *Setup » Markets » Amazon » Data exchange » Data export*.
. In the *Export catalogue* area, select the catalogue from the drop-down list.
. *_Optional:_* Enter item IDs and/or tag IDs separated by commas to filter the data to exported.
. *_Optional:_* Select a manufacturer from the drop-down list to filter the data to be exported.
. Click on *Export* (icon:box_plus[set=plenty]). +
→ The export starts. +
*_Note:_* Leave the browser window open whilst the export file is generated. Some flatfiles contain a lot of data. As such, the export can take several minutes.
. Scroll down to the *Download CSV of the catalogue export* area.
. In the column to the right, click on *Download* for the catalogue.
. Save the file on your computer. +
*_Note:_* The CSV file cannot be imported in plentymarkets. As such, you need to make any changes in the catalogue for them to take effect during the export.

== Troubleshooting

[.collapseBox]
.I mapped fields incorrectly and exported incorrect data to Amazon as a result. What can I do?
--
First, correct the incorrect mappings in the catalogue. The data is transmitted to Amazon once a day at night.
--

////
If you need to change something before this automatic export, you can export the corrected catalogue to a <<#1100, CSV file>> and manually upload this CSV file to Amazon Seller Central.
////

[.collapseBox]
.I have switched from my old, reliable export to the new catalogues and it’s not working correctly. What can I do?
--
Don’t panic. Go to the *Data » Catalogues* menu and set the catalogue to inactive. Your variation data is transmitted to Amazon with the old export and you can check and correct your settings. Our support team is here to help you if you run into problems or have questions.
--

== Next steps

You have set up the interface to Amazon and have prepared your variations and the export. What to do next depends on the additional Amazon services that you want to use:
