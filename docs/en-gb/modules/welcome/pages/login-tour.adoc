== Finding your way around the back end

The main navigation bar is up top. But there's much more behind all the menus. You'll notice that drop-downs appear when you move your mouse over the various menus that let you access all important areas of plentymarkets.

image::welcome/images/main-navigation.png[]

* *plentymarkets Logo (Start)* = On the left, you will see the plentymarkets logo.
This is where you can find information related to your plentymarkets system.
For example, here you can view <<business-decisions/your-contract#, your contract with plentymarkets>> or you can access the plentysystems changelog and see which new features have recently been released.
* *Modules* = In the middle, you’ll find the plentymarkets modules that keep your day-to-day business running smoothly.
The modules all fit together perfectly:
From Item management to the web shop, fulfilment and payment.
* *Setup* = This menu is where you configure the tools and functions in your plentymarkets system. Take a look at our <<welcome/assistants#, assistants>> and at the <<welcome/quick-start#, quick start>>. These resources are designed help new users set up their systems.

[TIP]
.What do the colourful tags mean?
====
When hovering over the different main menu items in the back end, you will find several tags. These tags indicate for example that a new menu item has been added.

* *New* (green) A stable functionality of the menu entry is already given. The functionality is either completely new or replaces another one.
* *Test phase* (orange) This corresponds to the beta version. The menu entry’s functionality is available, but might be partly limited.
* *Deprecated* (red) A menu entry with this tag will soon be replaced by another one or disappear completely. Thus, there is no further development of the existing functionalities.

=== Carrying out changes in the assistant

If you want to carry out changes in an assistant, it depends on whether they affect the following steps.
If your changes do not affect following steps, you can immediately return to the summary and directly finalise the assistant.

On the last page of the assistant you will find a summary. Here, you can take a look at all settings that have been carried out in the different steps.
If you reopen an assistant that has already been finalised, you get directly to the summary so you can find the setting that you want to edit with just one click.
