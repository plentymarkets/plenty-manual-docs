As you have already seen, you can extend the functionality of your webshop by using plugins. You have already installed some plugins using the *Integrations Assistant*, but there are many more ways to customise plentymarkets. To illustrate this, we are going to add a new plugin to the system, install it and set it up.

This new plugin will give customers the opportunity to rate the items we offer in our shop. It will also show this feedback to other potential customers. We can accomplish this with the Customer feedback plugin. You can get this plugin for free on plentyMarketplace.

.Setup methods
====
The item detail view of each plugin describes how to set it up. For the purposes of this quick start, we will also take a look at all necessary settings below.
====

Let us install our new plugin now. The procedure is the same as when you installed the Cash in advance plugin in the previous chapter.

:plugin: Customer feedback

include::../../plugins/_chapters/plugin-in-set-installieren-en_gb.adoc[]

Once the plugin has been installed, you can start setting it up. However, first we have to activate the plugin, so that it we can actually use it in our webshop later on.

[.instruction]
Activating Customer feedback in the set:

. In the Customer feedback row, click on *Inactive* in the *Active* column. +
→ The plugin is activated.

Let us now have a look at the settings. In some cases, like *Cash in advance*, the settings are carried out in the system menu. In others, like *Customer feedback*, you have to carry out the settings directly in the plugin settings.

[.instruction]
Setting up Customer feedback:

. Open the settings (icon:cog[]) of the Customer feedback plugin. +
→ The plugin detail view opens. The *Configuration* tab is already open.
. Select the options *Release feedbacks automatically*, *Show date for the feedback* and *Allow adding feedbacks only if the item was purchased*.
. *Save* the settings.

This way, customers can give feedback for an item after purchasing it. If another customers view the same item, the feedback will be displayed automatically.

Finally, we have to ensure that the feedback is actually visible in our webshop. This means we have to create some container links.

[.instruction]
Setting up container links:

include::../../plugins/_textblocks/instructions/plugin-container-verknuepfung-en_gb.adoc[menu-path]
. From the drop-down list, select the option *Feedback Javascript (Feedback)*.
. Select *Script loader: Register/load JS*.
. From the drop-down list, select the option *Feedback CSS (plentyShop LTS) (Feedback)*.
. Select *Template: Style*.
. From the drop-down list, select the option *Feedback ratings (Feedback*).
. Select *Single item: Container for customer feedback*.
. From the drop-down list, select the option *Feedback category ratings (Feedback*).
. Select *Category item list: Before prices container*.
. *Save* the links.

This concludes the setup. Now customers can rate items after purchasing them. In the next chapter, we will return to one of the default plugins: plentyShop LTS. You can use this plugin to change the design of your webshop.
