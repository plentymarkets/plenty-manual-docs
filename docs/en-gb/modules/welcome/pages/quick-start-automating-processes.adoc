On this page, we explain the basic settings that you should carry out in your plentymarkets system in order to automate processes. We recommend carrying out these settings before starting productive work with your system. Your plentymarkets system then completes these automatic processes in the background. +
In general, plentymarkets offers you 4 different methods of automating your work flows:

* Automatically sending email templates
* Event procedures
* Procedure manager
* Processes

[#10]
== Automatically sending email templates

In the step xref:welcome:quick-start-initial-settings.adoc#[initial settings], you learned how to set up the email templates for automatically sending email templates. +
Now, open the *Email accounts* assistant and go to the *Automatic despatch* step and select which email template should be sent in specific situations. You can find the assistant in the *Setup » Client » Global » Email accounts* menu. Some options are already preset in this menu. Check these settings and adjust them where necessary. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Setting up the automatic email despatch:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Global » Email accounts*.
. Open the *Email accounts* assistant.
. From the drop-down list next to the respective event in the *Automatic despatch* step, select an email template that should be sent automatically as soon as the event takes place.
. Select the option *Do not send* if _no_ email template should be sent.
. Finalise the assistant.

[WARNING]
.Have you set up the email template correctly?
====
In the *Automatic despatch* step of the *Email accounts* assistant in the *Setup » Client » Global » Email accounts* menu, you should only select email templates that you have edited and completed with your individual data.

== Setting up event procedures

Your daily business as a seller involves plenty of routine tasks. Order processing in particular is a complex process that requires you to act systematically. plentymarkets offers you the so-called event procedures that allow you to automate such routine tasks. +

The principle behind the event procedures consists of 3 steps. First, you select an event that triggers the procedure. You can use several filter settings to set up specific conditions for this event. The third step consists of selecting concrete procedures that should be carried out by the system as soon as the event takes place. The system will automatically carry out the defined procedure whenever this event occurs in the future. +

The following 2 event procedures have proven to be of value in the daily businesses of many plentymarkets sellers. We recommend that you automate sending your invoices in your plentymarkets system according to the first event procedure.

The first event procedure automatically generates the invoice document as soon as outgoing items have been booked for the corresponding order. Set up the event procedure according to the information provided in <<table-event-procedure-quick-start-generating-an-invoice>>.

[IMPORTANT]
.Setting up the document template
====
To make sure that the event procedure described below functions correctly, you need to finish setting up the template for the *invoice* document beforehand. An instruction is provided on the xref:orders:order-documents.adoc#[order documents] page of the manual.

== Using the procedure manager

Similar to the event procedures, the procedure manager can be used to carry out automatic procedures as soon as selected events take place. However, the procedure manager offers you the additional possibility to carry out the procedures automatically at a fixed point in time each day. Thus, the procedure manager is ideal to manage processes that should take place at regular intervals. +
Pay attention to the links at the end of this page in order to obtain more information about setting up and using the procedure manager.

[#40]
== Using processes

Processes are yet another tool that you can use to automate processes in your plentymarkets system. Setting up processes is recommended for example when order documents should not only be generated, but also printed automatically. You can only use processes if you have installed the plentyBase tool. Using processes is aimed at advanced plentymarkets users. Processes are therefore not further explained in the quick start. +
Pay attention to the links at the end of this page in order to obtain more information about setting up processes.
