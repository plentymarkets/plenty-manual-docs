IMPORTANT: Have you already set up countries of delivery and divided them into regions, set up the shipping profile and defined shipping costs? Not yet? Return to <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-shipping-options#, setting up shipping options>>.

Now you can add your products to plentymarkets.

[#5]
== Getting prepared

plentymarkets manages some item information centrally and links it to variations. So before you can create variations, you have to save this information in the system. The following item information must exist in the system before you can create items and variations:

* Categories
* Attributes
* Sales prices

Now you will learn how to save this information in plentymarkets.

[#10]
=== Creating categories

You can use categories of the type *item* to structure your product portfolio and organise the items in your webshop. Each item must be assigned to at least one category.

The plentyShop LTS webshop can have either 2 or up to 4 category levels:

* 1 main category + 1 subcategory
  ** The default navigation bar displays a maximum of one other category level below the main categories.
* 1 main category \+ up to 3 subcategories
  ** The mega menu displays up to three more levels below the main category.

[TIP]
.Planning the category structure
====
Spend some time thinking about which categories and sub-categories match your product line.
How will your customers find their way around the webshop?
Spend some time thinking about the topic before you create your categories.
You might find it helpful to draw a category tree and visualise your product groups.
====

To create a main category, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Creating a main category:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. From the drop-down list, select the client you want to create the category for. +
*_Tip:_* The default client is preselected by default.
. Click on *New category* in the bottom left corner. +
→ The *Create new category* window opens.
. Enter a name. +
*_Tip:_* *Main category* is selected by default.
. Click on *Create*. +
→ The category is created. +
→ The *Settings* tab of the category opens. +
. Enter a *position*. The position determines in which order the categories will be displayed in the webshop. Every new category has a default position of 0. +
*_Tip:_* Count by tens when creating position numbers. This will allow you to easily add new categories in between.
. Activate the *Client (store)* checkbox to display that category for the respective client.
. Enter a *Meta title*. +
*_Tip:_* The meta title will appear in the browser tab.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The category is created. +
*_Note:_* The category will only appear in the webshop if at least one of the items linked to the category is visible for that client.

Now create a subcategory for your new main category.

[.instruction]
Creating a subcategory:

. Go to *Item » Category*.
. Click on *New category* in the bottom left corner. +
→ The *Create new category* window opens.
. Enter a name. +
. Select *Subcategory*.
. Select the main category you want to create the subcategory for. +
*_Tip:_* If you want to create a subcategory on the third or fourth level, click on the folder icon to open the main category. Open the subcategory folders the same way until you reach the category you want to create a new subcategory for.
. Click on *Create*. +
→ The category is created. +
→ The *Settings* tab of the category opens.
. Enter a *position*. The position determines in which order the categories will be displayed in the webshop. Every new category has a default position of 0. +
*_Tip:_* Count by tens when creating position numbers. This will allow you to easily add new categories in between.
. Activate the *Client (store)* checkbox to display that category for the respective client.
. Enter a *Meta title*. +
*_Tip:_* The meta title will appear in the browser tab.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The category is created. +
*_Note:_* The category will only appear in the webshop if at least one of the items linked to the category is visible for that client.


[TIP]
.New categories not showing up in the webshop?
====
If your categories do not appear in the webshop, have a look at our <<item/online-store/checklist-categories-visibility, check list for category visibility>>.
====

[#20]
=== Creating attributes

Attributes are used to create variations. Variations are different models of the same item. They are all similar, but differ in one or multiple properties. Some typical attributes are e.g. colours and sizes. To prevent you from having to create a separate item for each of your products, plentymarkets creates attributes for these properties and assigns them to an item. To give you an example, we will describe how to create a *colour* attribute below.

[TIP]
.Example
====
You want to sell an item in 3 colours. Customers should be able to choose one of the 3 colours when buying the item. Instead of creating 3 items, we will create one item with three variations. We will use attribute values to create these variations.
====

[.instruction]
Creating the "Colour" attribute:

. Go to *Setup » Item » Attributes*.
. Click on *New attribute*. +
→ The *New attribute* window opens.
. Enter a *Name (internal)*, e.g. *Colour*. +
*_Tip:_* The internal name will not be visible in the webshop.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The attribute is created. +
→ The *Basic settings* tab of the attribute opens.
. Click on the *Name* tab.
. Enter a name for the attribute for each language you will use in your webshop. +
→ This name is shown in the webshop.
. *Save* the settings.

Now you can create attribute values for the attribute. As an example, we will create the value “Green”.

[.instruction]
Creating the value “Green” for the “Colour” attribute:

. Click on the *Values* tab.
. Click on *New value*. +
→ The *New value* window opens.
. Enter a *Name (internal)*, e.g. *Green*. +
*_Tip:_* The internal name will not be visible in the webshop.
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The value is created. +
→ The value is displayed in the list.
. Enter a name for the value in the *Name* column. +
*_Tip:_* The internal name is used by default. +
→ This name is shown in the webshop.
. *_Optional:_* If you offer your products in multiple languages, select the other languages from the *Show language* drop-down list.
. *_Optional:_* Enter the name of the value in this language in the *Name* column. +
→ This name will be shown in the webshop later on.
. *Save* the settings.

// Als Beispiel oder allgemein formulieren? Also "Farbe" oder "Attribut"?


[#30]
=== Adjusting the sales price

Define conditions for item prices and special reduced prices. For example, do you want to sell items at a lower price in your webshop than on Amazon? No problem! In this step, you can specify the conditions for individual marketplaces, customer classes, countries of delivery, etc.

Open the *Setup* menu and search for the *Sales prices* assistant. Once you’ve completed the assistant, you can <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-item-catalogue#220, link your new sales prices with all of the relevant variations>> and enter the actual prices.

[#40]
== Understanding the item structure

By now you have entered the following information required to create your products in plentymarkets:

* Categories
* Attributes
* Sales price

Before you start entering item data into the system, take a look at the item overview and the item structure. We will explain how the item overview works and introduce you to the example items preconfigured in your new system.

[#50]
=== Understanding the item overview

Go to *Item » Edit item*. This is where you can access all items and variations. In this item overview you can search for items and variations, edit them and create new items.

There are filters in the column on the left. Use them to search for specific subsets of items. When you’re first getting started, the most important filter is the *Active* filter. This filter specifies whether you only want to see the items and variations that are currently visible in your webshop. This filter is set to *Yes* by default. Once you have many items and variations, this filter will help you edit your items quicker. However, it can also cause some confusion in the beginning because inactive items will not be displayed when you click on *Search*, unless you have set the filter to *No* or *ALL*.

== Creating items and variations

It is finally time: You get to enter your very own items in plentymarkets. Depending on how many items you want to start with and how you have managed your item data so far, you have two ways of entering the data into the system:

* <<#100, Create items manually>> +
*_Tip:_* Once you have created your first item, you can work faster by copying this item and modifying the copy.
* <<#120, Import item data from a CSV file>> +
*_Tip:_* Even if you import your items, you should create at least one item manually to become familiar with the item structure. Remember to delete that example item before importing your data.

We will describe both ways below.

[#100]
=== Creating items manually

Now you will create your first item and make it ready for sale. To help you get started as quickly as possible, we will only describe the most necessary settings here to ensure that you can sell the item in your webshop.

[.instruction]
Creating items manually:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Click on *New*. +
→ The *New item* tab opens. +
*_Tip:_* The *Standard* item type is preselected by default.
. Enter a name.
. Enter a number for the content.
. Select a unit for this content from the drop-down list.
. Click on the category. +
→ This will become the default category for the item's main variation.
. Enter a *Price*. +
. *Save* the settings. +
→ The item is created. +
→ A main variation is created. +
→ The item's *Global* tab opens.
. Adjust the other settings as necessary. Pay attention to the information given in <<settings-edit-item>>. +
*_Tip:_* The settings described in <<settings-edit-item>> refer to the various tabs within the item’s editing window. The tab is displayed as a subheading in the table.
. *Save* the settings. +
*_Note:_* New items and changes to item data are not available in the webshop and exports immediately. +
*_Tip:_* View of a preview of the item:
 .. Click on the preview icon in the save bar of the item. +
 → The *Client (store)* window is displayed. +

|====

[#110]
=== Creating variations manually

Great! Now you have created your first item. You probably noticed than when creating a new item, you always create a main variation. If you only want to sell single items, the main variation is the same as your product. If you want to group your products as variations of the same item, you should create more variations next.

[TIP]
.Inheritance
====
Any time you create a variation, this variation inherits the following settings from the main variation:

* Availability settings
* Sales price and price
* Category
* Supplier
* Warehouse
* Client availability

Because of this, when creating an item with multiple variations, we recommend that you treat the main variation as a virtual instance and only use it to pass on data to the variations. If you do not want a variation to inherit one or multiple settings, you can disable inheritance for this variation and enter separate data for it.
====

[.instruction]
Creating one or multiple variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Click on the *Variations* tab.
. Click on *New*. +
→ The *Create new variations* window opens.
. Enter a number for the content.
. Select a unit for this content from the drop-down list.
. Select one or multiple attributes. +
→ The *Combinations* information displays how many variations will be created.
. Click on *Create variations*. +
→ The variations are created. +
→ The variation overview displays the variations. +
*_Tip:_* The variations inherit all inheritable settings from the main variation.  +
*_Note:_* New variations and changes to variation data are not available in the webshop and exports immediately. +
*_Tip:_* View a preview of the variation:
  .. Click on the preview icon in the save bar of the variation. +
  → The *Client (store)* window is displayed. +
  .. Use the drop-down list to specify which *Plugin Set* you want to see a preview of.
  .. Use the drop-down list to specify which *Client (Store)* you want to see a preview of.
  .. Click on *Execute*. +
  → A preview of the variation is shown.

[TIP]
.Copying an item
====
If you want to sell multiple similar items, you can save time during item creation by copying an item and adjusting it. Click on the *Copy* symbol in the top bar of the item.
====

[#120]
=== Importing items and variations

Of course it is not a problem if you want to import a large number of items all at once. To import items and variations, you need to have this data saved in a CSV file on your computer.

[TIP]
.Create an example item before the import
====
Even if you import your items, you should create at least one item manually to become familiar with the item structure. Remember to delete that example item before importing your data.
====

==== Importing item and variation data with the assistant

[#130]
===== Creating an import file

Prepare a CSV file containing your item data. Open the *Setup* menu and search for the *Item import* assistant. It creates an import template for item data that is tailored to your needs. Once you’ve completed the assistant, you’ll download the import template and fill your own item data into the file.

[TIP]
.Have you finished all of the prep work?
====
Before you start importing data, make sure you’ve saved all of the information that you want to link with items and variations. In order to create items in plentymarkets, you need the following information at minimum:

* Categories
* Attributes
* Sales prices
====

[#140]
===== Uploading your import file

Are you ready to upload your item data in plentymarkets? Open the *Setup* menu and search for the *Upload data* assistant.

==== Importing item and variation data via the import tool

Do you have a specific job in mind and you can’t complete it with assistants? Or are you looking for more comprehensive import options than are included in the assistants? The <<data/importing-data/ElasticSync#, import tool>> is just what you need for complex and comprehensive data imports!

Want to see an example? <<data/importing-data/elasticsync-best-practices/best-practices-elasticsync-creating-variations#, Learn how to import item and variation data via the import tool>>.

[#170]
== Saving item images

When you imported your items, you were able to save a URL for images that are available online. If your item images are not available online, you can save the images manually as described below.

NOTE: If you have already imported your item images during the item import, you can directly go to the <<#200, check list>>.

[#180]
=== Uploading item images

You can save images in the item’s *Images* tab and then link these images to item variations. You can upload up to 25 images per item. These images can be in JPG/JPEG or PNG format.

[TIP]
.Using the FTP upload
====
You should transfer larger quantities of images to the server via FTP upload. Note that the image files are named correctly, so that the images can be assigned to the correct items and variations during upload.
====

[.instruction]
Saving images for an item:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Click on the *Images* tab of the item.
. Drag and drop new images in the *Insert new image* section. +
icon:map-signs[] *_Or:_* Click on *Select files*.
. Use the *Availability* drop-down list to select the clients and/or referrers for which you want do use the image.
. *Save* the settings.

[#190]
=== Linking item images with variations

Now link the images saved for the item to one or more of its variations. Proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Linking item images to variations:

. Go to *Item » Edit item*.
. Open the item.
. Click on the *Images* tab of the item. +
→ A preview of all images saved for the item is displayed.
. Select the images you want to link to one or multiple variations.
. Click on *Variation link* at the bottom of the page. +
→ The *Variation link* window opens.
. Select the variations you want to link the selected images to.
. Click on *Link*. +
→ The images are linked to the selected variations.


[#200]
== Check list item catalogue

Work through the check list in order to review your settings for the item catalogue.

[%interactive]
* [ ] Did you create appropriate categories for your items?
* [ ] Did you create description texts for all items?
* [ ] Did you set the correct item availability levels?
* [ ] Did you select the availability of all items you want to offer in your webshop?
* [ ] Did you check that all prices are displayed correctly in the webshop?
