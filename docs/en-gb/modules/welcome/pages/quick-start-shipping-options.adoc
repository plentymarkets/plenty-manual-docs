On this page, we tell you how to prepare your system so it is ready for shipping items: You determine to which countries you send your items and group these countries into regions. Grouping countries into regions is necessary for saving the shipping costs because shipping costs cannot be saved for single countries of delivery, but for regions only. Furthermore, you set up the shipping service provider and the shipping profile including the shipping costs.

[#100]
== Prepared settings

Some settings have already been prepared in your system for you so that you are able to start even faster with selling your items:

* the countries of delivery _Germany_ and _United Kingdom_ are active
* the region *Germany* with the country of delivery _Germany_ is created
* the shipping service provider *DHL* is created +
→ it is necessary that you carry out further settings here
* the shipping profile for DHL is created +
→ you need to carry out further settings here

How to change the pre-selected options and carry out further settings is described in the following chapters.

[#200]
== Activating countries of delivery

The countries of delivery _Germany_ and _United Kingdom_ are activated in your system by default. Proceed as described in the following to set up further countries of delivery.

[.instruction]
Activating countries of delivery:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*. +
→ The *Countries of delivery* tab opens.
. Use the drop-down list in the *Active* column to set countries of delivery to *Active*.
. In the *Warehouse* column, select which warehouse should be chosen as the default warehouse for the respective country's orders.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#300]
== Grouping countries of delivery into regions

Activated countries of delivery have to be grouped into regions. Creating regions is necessary because you can determine the shipping costs only for regions and not for single countries. Group all countries of delivery with the same shipping costs and the same shipping service provider-specific services to one region.

[TIP]
.Example: Countries of delivery Germany and Spain
====
It is not possible to assign the countries of delivery Germany and Spain to one region: parcels within Germany are sent with _DHL Paket national_; parcels from Germany to Spain, however, are sent with _DHL Paket international_.

Therefore, it is important that you carefully consider in advance how you would like to group the countries of delivery. A useful example for sellers in Germany is to group their countries of delivery into the regions _Domestic_, _Europe_ and _Rest of world_.
====

The region *Germany* with the country of delivery Germany is already saved in your system by default.

Proceed as described in the following to create further regions.

[.instruction]
Grouping countries of delivery into regions:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Open the *Regions » New region* tab.
. Enter a name for the region, e.g. _Europe_.
. Select the countries that you have just activated for this region under *Available countries*. +
→ The countries are moved to *Selected countries*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The new region is now available in the *Overview* tab.

[#400]
== Setting up shipping service providers

Now you learn how to set up the shipping service provider *DHL Shipping (Versenden)*. Therefore, it is required that you register with the shipping service provider in advance.

[.instruction]
Setting up the shipping service provider:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Shipping service provider* tab. +
→ The shipping service provider *DHL* is already available in the system.
. If required, change the name of the shipping service provider in the fields *Name (en)* and *Name (back end)*. +
→ *Name (en)* is visible to your customers in the online shop as well as on invoices. *Name (back end)* is not visible to customers. It serves for internal use for you and your employees.
. Select the shipping service provider *DHL Shipping (Versenden)* from the drop-down list *Shipping service provider*.
. The DHL tracking URL is already saved. Pay attention to the tracking URL information in the green box.
. Enter the address of the shipping service provider. +
→ This is required in order to work in compliance with GDPR. For further information, refer to the <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800, Preparing the shipment>> page of the manual.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

Proceed as described in the <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#800, Creating a shipping service provider>> chapter of our manual to create further shipping service providers in the same way.

[TIP]
.Tracking URL
====
The tracking URL is used to track shipments. If you save the URL in the *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings » Tab: Shipping service provider* menu and add the template variable *$TrackingURL* to the email template for the shipping confirmation, your customer can click on the URL in the email to track when the parcel will arrive.

The DHL tracking URL is already saved in your system.

== Setting up a shipping profile

In plentymarkets, a shipping profile is required so that right from the very beginning the correct shipping conditions are available for the order of your customer and the shipping process can be processed properly. In order that plentymarkets knows how an item is to be shipped and only this shipping profile can be selected in the online shop by your customer, you have to link the item with the shipping profile afterwards. For further information refer to the quick start page <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-item-catalogue#, Setting up a catalogue of items>>.

[TIP]
.Keep the shipping profiles simple
====
Keep your shipping profiles as simple as possible. The more complex the settings are, the more likely it is that errors occur. In addition, shipping cost models that are too complex may confuse customers and ultimately deter them from making a purchase.
====

[.instruction]
Setting up a shipping profile:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Shipping profiles* tab.
. Click on the DHL shipping profile. +
→ The *Base* tab opens.
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-set-up-shipping-profile>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

|Setting |Explanation

| *ID*
|Every shipping profile automatically receives an ID when it is saved. This ID cannot be changed.

| *Shipping service provider*
|Select the shipping service provider *DHL Shipping (Versenden)* for this shipping profile.

| *Name*
|Enter a name that is shown to your customers in the online shop.

| *Name (back end)*
|Enter a name used for internal reference in the plentymarkets back end only. This name is not visible to the customer.

| *Flag*
|The flag *1* is selected for DHL by default. The flag is shown in the order overview, for example.

| *Priority*
|The highest priority is selected by default. The priority determines the order in which shipping profiles are shown during the checkout process in the online shop.

| *Category*
|The lowest category is selected by default. The category determines when a shipping profile is shown in the checkout. +
*_Note:_* Tips and tricks about the category settings can be found in our <<fulfilment/preparing-the-shipment#1300, manual>>.

| *Activate for new items*
|Activate to assign this shipping profile to new items by default. +
Select the option *Activate for new items* in at least one shipping profile. In doing so, new items are always assigned to this one profile at minimum. It is not possible to ship an item if it is not linked to at least one shipping profile.

| *Clients (stores)*
|All clients are activated by default.

| *Order referrer*
|All order referrers are activated by default. Deactivate the order referrers accordingly when the shipping profile should only apply to certain orders. At least one shipping profile should contain the order referrer *ALL*. This guarantees that there is at least one shipping profile available for all orders.

| *Blocked payment methods*, *Blocked customer classes*
|Select link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/payment[payment methods^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] and customer classes that should *not* apply to the shipping profile.

== Setting up the table of shipping charges

After you have created the shipping profile, you should take care of the shipping costs. For each region that you created, an individual table of shipping charges has to be set up.

Before you enter values, you have to choose a calculation type for each region. By default, the calculation type *Flat rate* is set.

[.instruction]
Setting up the table of shipping charges:

. Go to *Setup » Orders » Shipping » Settings*.
. Click on the *Shipping profiles* tab.
. Open the DHL shipping profile. +
→ The *Base* tab opens.
. Click on the *Table of shipping charges* tab.
. Expand the region *Germany* (icon:chevron-down[]).
. The calculation type *Flat rate* is selected in your system by default.
. If required, change the amount in the *Flat rate shipping charge* field. The amount EUR 5.99 is selected by default.
. If required, change the amount for the item value in the *No shipping costs for orders for values over* field from which deliveries should take place free of charge for the customer. The amount EUR 250.00 is selected by default.
. If required, also change the values in the fields *From an item value of …​* and *…​ flat rate shipping charge of*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

== Registering the shipment

As soon as an order is in your system, you register the order with the shipping service provider – either manually or automatically using a process.

You can only use processes when you installed the plentyBase tool. Using processes is aimed at advanced plentymarkets users. Processes are therefore not further explained in the quick start. Pay attention to the links at the end of this page in order to obtain more information about setting up processes.

[.instruction]
Registering the shipment:

*_Tip:_* Changing the order status can be combined with an event procedure which, for example, automatically books outgoing items.
. Place a checkmark for the orders that you want to register.
. Click on *Register* (icon:cog[]).

After you have successfully registered the order, the shipping label is available in the registered order. Print this label and affix it to the package.
