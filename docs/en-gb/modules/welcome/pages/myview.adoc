== What does myView mean?

MyView user interfaces are based on a special technology that is developed by plentysystems. While you can't configure some UIs in plentysystems, myView interfaces offer you the possibility to create personal view sets, thus enabling you to adjust the layout in your own way This manual page offers you insights on what myView has to offer you.

Many parts of plentysystems are available as myView. All these menus offer you a default view that you can instantly use. Additionally, you can create indefinite individual view sets. <<table-myview-overview>> shows a list of all menus where that is possible. Click on the links in the table to get more information.
