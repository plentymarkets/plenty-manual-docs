IMPORTANT: Have you already booked stock? Not yet? Return to <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-booking-stock#, Booking stock>>.

This page will now teach you how to set up your plentyShop LTS webshop. After you have set up a catalogue of items and categories, you will now learn how to set up the necessary webshop plugins and how you can customise your store’s appearance. +
This chapter is divided into three sections: In a first step, you will carry out important <<#510, preparations>>, so that your webshop will work properly. In the next step, you need to carry out relevant settings in the *plentyShop LTS configuration*. Lastly, you will design the appearance of your webshop with the *ShopBuilder*, the plentymarkets construction kit system for webshops.

[#10]
== Preparations

Here you will find information about the most important preliminary tasks for setting up your plentyShop LTS webshop. This section also specifies the data required for initial setup.

[#20]
=== Saving legal information

plentyShop LTS provides pages for displaying your legal texts. In the *Legal information* menu, you can save your *terms and conditions*, *cancellation rights*, the cancellation form, privacy policy and legal disclosure for your webshop.

[.instruction]
Entering your terms and conditions as text:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » webshop » Legal information*.
. Expand the desired *language*. +
. The tab *Terms and conditions* is preselected.
. The tab *Text* is preselected.

. *Save* the settings.

Enter the texts for the *cancellation rights*, the *cancellation form*, the *privacy policy and the legal disclosure of your webshop in the same way for the desired languages. These texts will be displayed on the respective pages in your *plentyShop LTS* webshop.

[#30]
=== Creating default profiles

Set up a default country of delivery, a default shipping method, a default shipping profile and a default payment method. These are preselected for non-registered visitors of your webshop. You can only use *plugin payment methods* in your plentyShop LTS webshop, which you can download from the link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/plugins/payment[plentyMarketplace^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

[#40]
=== Setting up automatic emails

The *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Automatic* menu contains various events you can link with an email template.
