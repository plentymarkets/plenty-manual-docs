== Handling of assistants

In the following, you will find some information and tips on how to handle the assistants.

[#300]
=== Navigating in the assistant

Once you have completed a step, the *Next* button brings you to the next step.
However, it is also possible to access the next step via the side navigation. Steps that have already been completed are highlighted in green in the navigation bar and you can jump back and forth between them.

[#400]
=== Carrying out changes in the assistant

If you want to carry out changes in an assistant, it depends on whether they affect the following steps.
If your changes do not affect following steps, you can immediately return to the summary and directly finalise the assistant.
However, if you carry out changes that affect settings of following steps, you have to click through all following steps once again, as otherwise errors may occur.

[#500]
=== Summary at end of assistant

On the last page of the assistant you will find a summary. Here, you can take a look at all settings that have been carried out in the different steps.
If you reopen an assistant that has already been finalised, you get directly to the summary so you can find the setting that you want to edit with just one click.
