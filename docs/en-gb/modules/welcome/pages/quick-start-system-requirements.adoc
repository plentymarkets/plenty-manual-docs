== Troubleshooting

The following points may cause problems if you are working with plentymarkets.

* Your browser is not up-to-date. Check your browser version. If a newer version is available, update your browser.
* Your CPU is busy. If your CPU is already running at full capacity due to normal operating procedures, then you should close programmes that you do not need at the time.
* Your memory is too small. Check the size of your memory. We recommend a minimum capacity of 8 GB.
* Your Java version is not up-to-date. Check the Java version installed on your computer and check if a later version exists. Install the current version.
* Your hard drive is more than 70% full and has not been changed in years. Depending on the operating system and the quality of the hardware, you will notice a significant decrease in performance after two years. Delete any unnecessary files or reinstall the system. Another cost-effective solution would be to purchase a newer and more powerful hard drive/SSD.
