This page describes the settings that you can use to customise your user account and your plentymarkets system.
Of course you can change these settings at any time.

[#10]
== Customising your own user account

[#20]
=== Opening the user account

There are two different ways to access your own user account.

* Move your mouse cursor over the user symbol in the top right corner (icon:user-circle[]) and then click on your name.
* Go to *Setup » Settings » User » Accounts*. Then click on the button icon:user[] *My account*.

[#30]
=== Adding a user image

In order to have a user image displayed instead of the empty user button (icon:user-circle[]) in your plentymarkets back end, you have to be registered with link:https://en.gravatar.com/[gravatar.com^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[].

[.instruction]
Adding a user image:

. <<#20, Open your own user account>>. +
→ The tab *Master data* opens.
. Enter the email address that you use for gravatar.com in the *Email* field.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ Reload the system to display the user image.

[#40]
=== Complimentary close

Enter a text into the *Complimentary close* tab. This text is automatically added to the end of your messages and comments in the ticket system. Generally, this text consists only of a closing and your name. When sending emails from the ticket system, the complimentary close and the <<#50, signature>> will automatically be added to the end of the email.

[.instruction]
Setting up the complimentary close:

. <<#20, Open your own user account>>.
. Click on the *Complimentary close* tab.
. Enter your complimentary close.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[#50]
=== Signature

Enter a text into the *Signature* tab. This text is automatically added to the end of your messages and comments in the ticket system. Generally, this text consists of your contact details as well as information about where your company is registered and its registration number. Depending on your company’s legal form, the name of the company, the chief executive officer and, if applicable, the European VAT number are all mandatory inputs.
When sending emails from the ticket system, the <<#40, complimentary close>> and the signature will automatically be added to the end of the email.

[TIP]
.Template variable for the signature
====
The template variables *$Signature* and *$SignatureHTML* contain the complimentary close.
====

[.instruction]
Setting up the signature:

. <<#20, Open your own user account>>.
. Click on the *Signature* tab.
. Enter your signature.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[WARNING]
.Mandatory entries in emails
====
Since the beginning of 2007, mandatory entries for email signatures in Germany correspond to those for company business letters. Non-compliance can result in a fine or in a costly warning being issued by a competitor. +
Read up on the legal regulations for signatures in your own country or contact a legal adviser for such information.
====

[#60]
=== Personal settings

Use the *Personal settings* tab to change the settings of whichever user is currently logged into the system. Therefore, you can only see this tab in your own user account. The tab is divided into 3 tabs with settings that only apply to you personally. These tabs are *General*, *Shortcuts* and *Favourites*.

[#70]
==== General

Tabs are marked with a red flag when you made changes, but did not save these changes.
If you close a tab without having saved the changes, a window will appear that you have to edit before being able to continue working with your system.

* Click on *Close* to close the tab without saving the changes.
* Click on *Cancel* to save the settings or to make further changes.

If you do not want to have such warning messages displayed for your user account, deactivate this function in the *General* tab of your own personal settings.
You can also reset the user-specific settings here.

. <<#20, Open your own user account>>.
. Click on the tab *Personal settings » General*.

=== Synchronising the calendar with external calendar tools

You can use a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV[CalDAV^]{nbsp}icon:external-link[] interface to synchronise your calendar with external calendar tools. For example, you can synchronise your calendar with tools such as Mac Calendar or iPad Calendar.

The option *Calendar* has to be activated in the *Owner* tab of the user account as described in the <<#270, Setting the back end user as owner>> chapter. You need to know the settings for the user in order to carry out the configuration. The settings are saved in the user's *Calendar* tab.

Refer to the external tool's documentation to find out how to synchronise your plentymarkets calendar with the external calendar tool.
