IMPORTANT: Have you already allowed pop-ups, added a bookmark for your back end login and checked the system requirements? Not yet? Return to <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-taking-off#, Taking off>>.

In this part of the quick start, you find explanations about general settings such as saving company data and bank details as well as explanations about setting up the email despatch and email templates. Furthermore, we explain on this page how you order a domain and an SSL certificate for your online shop.

You can carry out some of the above mentioned settings with our virtual assistants. They will help you set up your system step by step.

[#100]
== Adjusting the user account and saving the company, account and bank details

Go to *Setup » Assistants* and open the *Basic setup* area. Complete the *Basics* assistant to carry out the following settings:

* adjust your own user account
* save company data
* save contact data
* save bank details

[IMPORTANT]
.Changing contract information
====
Making changes to this master data will not have any effect on the customer information that is saved in your contract with plentymarkets, e.g. for billing purposes. Contract information has to be changed in the *plentymarkets logo (Start) » My account* menu in the *Contracts* area.
====

Your bank details can be replaced with the corresponding text via so-called template variables in email templates. This means that plentymarkets replaces the variables with the corresponding content in the emails. The template variable `$BankOwner` will be replaced with the name of the account holder and `$BankName` will insert the name of the bank. `$BankIban` will be replaced with the IBAN and `$BankSwift` with the BIC.

For further information about template variables, refer to the chapters <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-initial-settings#600, Example: Customising the email template>> and <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-initial-settings#700, Inserting template variables and template functions>> further down on this page.

[#250]
== Creating a customer class

Use customer classes to categorise your customer base according to specific criteria. You can determine the minimum order quantities, grant discounts and decide whether the prices in your online shop are displayed as gross or net prices.

For the beginning, we recommend creating 2 customer classes: B2C for your end customers and B2B for sellers. You may need the customer classes for further settings that you carry out in your plentymarkets system such as saving sales prices.

[.instruction]
Creating a customer class:

. Go to *Setup » CRM » Customer classes*.
. Click on the *New customer class* tab.
. Carry out the desired settings. Note <<#table-quick-start-create-customer-class>>.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-quick-start-create-customer-class]]
.Creating a customer class
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

| *Name*
|Enter the name for the customer class, e.g. standard customer or B2C.

| *Discount type*
|If required, select a discount type. For further information about the discount types, refer to the <<crm/managing-contacts#25, Using the discount system>> chapter on the <<crm/managing-contacts#, Contacts>> page of the manual.

| *Allowed payment methods*
|Select which methods of payment are permitted for the customer class. These methods of payment will later be available in your online shop. By default, all available methods of payment are allowed.

| *Display of the prices in the online shop*
|Select whether the prices are displayed as gross or net prices in the online shop.

|====

[#300]
== Setting up the email despatch

Go to *Setup » Assistants* and open the *Basic setup* area. Complete the *Email accounts* assistant to carry out the following settings:

* To authorise plentymarkets to send emails via your email account, you have to enter the login details of your email program in plentymarkets. Note that it might be necessary to obtain an approval from your email provider so that plentymarkets is allowed to send emails.
* activate the test mode
* save the signature for your outgoing emails
* activate the information service to receive a blind copy of all outgoing emails

[TIP]
.Test mode sends emails only to your email address
====
There is a test mode which is activated by default. When the test mode is activated, emails are only sent to the email address you saved. This allows you to check all settings of the email despatch and the content before you switch to the live mode.
====

[#500]
== Setting up email templates

plentymarkets generates all emails based on templates. For the beginning, we recommend setting up the email templates listed in <<#table-email-templates>>. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates* to create email templates.

You can adapt all email templates to your individual needs. Go to the chapter <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-initial-settings#600, Example: Customising the email template>> further down on this page of the manual to find an example about how to customise the email template *Online store: confirmation of store order*.

[[table-email-templates]]
.Email templates that are already set up in your system
[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Email template |Explanation

| *Order: Invoice as PDF attachment*
|Sends an invoice to the customer as an attachment. +
*_Important:_* An invoice template for the location *Germany* is already pre-configured. You can adapt the template to your individual needs. To do so, go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents » Invoice*. If an invoice already exists for the order and you have set up an event procedure, the invoice will be sent to your customer automatically because the PDF attachment *Invoice* is selected by default in the template *Order: Invoice as PDF attachment*. +
 For further information refer to the quick start page <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-automating-processes#, Automating processes>>.

| *Order: Shipping confirmation*
|Is sent when the items are shipped. +
*_Tip:_* Create an event procedure with the event *Package number* and add filters and procedures so that the package number that is saved in the order will be inserted via the template variable `$TrackingURL`. For further information refer to the quick start page <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-automating-processes#, Automating processes>>.

| *Online store: Confirmation of store order*
|Informs the customer that their order has been received. +
*_Important:_* For legal reasons, you should insert the cancellation rights as well as the terms and conditions in this email template. Also, pay close attention to any wording in the email template that relates to the contract between you and your customer. It is therefore recommended that you have your texts checked by a specialist lawyer. +
Save the texts for the cancellation rights and the terms and conditions in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Online store » Legal* menu. The template variables `$CancellationRightsText` and `$GeneralTermsConditionsText` are automatically replaced with the cancellation rights and the terms and conditions in the email.
|====

[TIP]
====
There are many more email templates that are already available in your plentymarkets system. Adjust these email templates, if required, and link them with an event in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Automatic* menu or set up an event procedure. For further information refer to the quick start page <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-automating-processes#, Automating processes>>.
====

[#550]
=== Saving legal information

It is important that you save the legal information for your online shop in advance. Legal information include terms and conditions, cancellation rights, privacy policy, legal disclosure and cancellation form. Insert template variables in the email template. The variables will be replaced with the text in the email templates.

We recommend having the texts checked by a specialist lawyer before you use them.

[.instruction]
Saving legal information:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Online store » Legal*.
. Expand the language *English* (icon:plus-square-o[]).
. Insert the texts in the corresponding tabs *Terms and conditions*, *Cancellation right*, *Privacy policy*, *Legal disclosure* and *Cancellation form* in the *Text* tab. +
→ *_Tip:_* Have the texts about the legal information checked by a specialist lawyer.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.


[#600]
=== Example: Customising the email template

In this chapter, we explain how you customise an email template based on the email template *Online store: confirmation of store order*.

[.instruction]
Customising the email template:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates*.
. Open the *General email templates* folder and click on *Online store: Confirmation of store order*. +
→ The *Settings* tab of the template opens.
. If required, change the settings. Note <<#table-set-up-email-templates>>.
. Click on the tab *Email message » Tab: Content » Tab: Plain text*. +
→ The standard text of the template opens.
. If required, change the text.
. Insert e.g. the template variables `$CancellationRightsText` and `$GeneralTermsConditionText`. By doing so, the texts for the terms and conditions and the cancellation rights will be inserted in the email template. +
→ *_Note:_* You have saved these texts in the system in advance as described in the <<welcome/quick-start/quick-start-initial-settings#550, Saving legal information>> chapter. +
→ Open the available template variables by clicking on *Template variables and functions* (icon:code[role="blue"]).
. Further information about the template variables for legal information can be found in <<#table-template-variables-legal-information>> at the end of this chapter.
. Replace the sample contact data at the end of the template with your own contact data. +
→ You can use the template variable `$SignatureText` for this.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[[table-set-up-email-templates]]

[cols="1,3"]
|====
|Setting |Explanation

2+|Header

| *Save*
|Saves the email template.

| *Template variables and template functions*
|Click on icon:code[role="blue"] to open all template variables and template functions that are available in plentymarkets and that you can use in your email templates.

2+|Tab: Settings

| *Owner*
|The setting *All* is selected by default. This means that all users can access this template.

| *Name*
|Name of the email template that is used for internal distinction. This name is not displayed to the recipient. You can add this name.

| *Content*
| Select *Plain text only* (default setting) or *Only in HTML format*.

| *Template type*
| Select *All* (default setting) if you want the email template to be used for all areas. If you want to use the template in only one area of plentymarkets, you can define this area here by selecting the area from the drop-down list.

| *PDF attachment*
|The setting *No PDF attachment* is selected by default. +
*_Note:_* If you want to attach the invoice as PDF file to your emails later on, you have to set up the invoice template in advance. Furthermore, an invoice has to exist for the order and it would be best if you set up an event procedure for this event.
| *Document attachment*
|The setting *No PDF attachment* is selected by default. +
*_Note:_* If you would like to attach a brochure or product catalogue, you have to upload this document in the *CMS » Documents* menu. The drop-down list *Document attachment* only lists those documents that were uploaded in the *CMS » Documents* menu.

| *Reply to*
|Enter an email address. If someone replies to the email template, their message is sent to this address. +
*_Note:_* If no email address is entered, replies to this email template are sent to the email address that is saved in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Login details* menu.

| *Use design*
|You only have to activate this option if you wish to link an HTML design with the email template. This setting is not relevant in this case because we only describe plain text and no HTML-formatted text in the quick start.

| *Client (store)*
|All clients are activated by default.

2+|Tab: Email message

| *Select language*
|The language *en* is selected by default.

| *Subject*
|If required, adapt the standard text of the subject. Choose the subject carefully so that the emails are recognised by the email account and displayed in the customer's inbox instead of their spam folder. +
*_Note:_* It is possible to insert template variables in the subject line.
|====

After you have adjusted and saved the email template *Online store: Confirmation of store order*, this template will automatically be sent to your customers when they place an order in your online shop. This is because this template is already linked with the event *New order from online store* in the *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Automatic* menu.

[[table-template-variables-legal-information]]

[#700]
=== Using template variables and template functions

In plentymarkets, email templates always consist of text as well as template functions and template variables. When plentymarkets sends emails, it automatically replaces the template variables and template functions with the corresponding content. The customer's name will appear instead of the template variable `$CustomerFullName`. The customer's email address will appear instead of `$CustomerEmail`. The order number will appear instead of the variable `$OrderID`.

[IMPORTANT]
.Pay attention to the correct spelling of the template variables
====
Because template variables and template functions trigger pre-configured system commands, it is important that you strictly observe the correct spelling. In order to avoid errors by misspelling, copy the variables and functions and insert them in the desired place in the email template.
====

[.instruction]
Inserting template variables and template functions:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates*.
. Open the email template into which you would like to insert the template variable.
. Click on *Template variables and functions* (icon:code[role="blue"]). +
→ The *Template variables and template functions* window opens.
. Copy the variable that you want to insert into the email template. +
→ You can search for the variables using the Ctrl+f or cmd+f keys.
. Insert the variable in the text field in the *Email message » Tab: Content » Tab: Plain text* tab.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[TIP]
.Using the template function *{%Link_Checkout()%}*
====
All emails that you send to your customers should contain the template function `{%Link_Checkout()%}`. This function replaces the link to the *My account* area of your online shop. Your customers can then click on the link to update their data, see the order history, add further items to the order or track the order status.
====

[#800]
=== Attaching files to email templates

You can add 2 types of files to your email templates:

* a PDF attachment +
* a document attachment

We describe the difference of these 2 attachments in the following.

Possible types of a PDF attachment, e.g. the invoice, are already available in your plentymarkets system. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents* to set up these documents.

A document attachment could be for example a product catalogue, instructions or a photo file. Go to *CMS » Documents* to upload these files.

[#900]
==== Creating and attaching PDFs

The documents that you can send as PDF attachment are automatically generated by your plentymarkets system. An example of such a document is the invoice.

It is set up in 3 steps:

1. Create a document template, e.g. in a business letter template including the logo, and save it to your computer
2. Adjust the document settings (in the following, this step is described in detail)
3. Link the document with the email template (in the following, this step is described in detail)

[.instruction]
Adjusting the document settings:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Locations » [Select location] » Documents*.
. Select the document that you want to edit, e.g. *Invoice*. +
→ The document *Invoice* is already pre-set. If required, adapt the invoice template.
. Click on the tab *PDF template*.
. Click on *Add template* (icon:plus-square[role="green"]).
. If required, select a *Payment method*. +
→ The setting *Standard* is selected by default.
. Click on *Select template* (icon:upload[role="purple"]).
. Open the PDF document template that you previously created.
. Click on *Upload template* (icon:save[role="green"]).
. Click on *Preview* (icon:eye[role="blue"]) to show a document preview.
. Click on *Delete* (icon:minus-square[role="red"]) to delete the document.

[.instruction]
Linking a document with the email template:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates*.
. Open the email template.
. Select the file that you want to send as attachment from the drop-down list *PDF attachment*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The document is attached to the email.

[#1000]
==== Creating and attaching documents

All of the documents you want to attach to an email template have to be uploaded to the server first. An example of such a document are the terms and conditions. This document is often attached with the order confirmation – given that you did not directly insert the terms and conditions in the email template via the template variable `$GeneralTermsConditionsText`.

It is set up in 2 steps. First, you upload the document in the *CMS » Documents* menu. Second, attach the document to an email template. To do so, proceed as described below.

[.instruction]
Uploading a document:

. Go to *CMS » Documents*.
. Click on *Browse...* in the *Upload* tab.
. Select the file that you want to upload and click on *Open*.
. Select one of the options from the *Right* drop-down list. +
The right specifies whether the document should be visible to *Employees* or *Customers* only or to all visitors of your online shop (= *Public*).
. If required, enter a name for the folder.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings.

[.instruction]
Linking a document with an email template:

. Go to *Setup » Client » [Select client] » Email » Templates*.
. Open the email template.
. Select the file that you want to send as attachment from the drop-down list *Document attachment*.
. *Save* (icon:save[role="green"]) the settings. +
→ The file is attached to the email.

[#1100]
== Ordering a domain

The word "domain" refers to an Internet address in the form of a name and an extension, i.e. the top level domain, e.g. *.de*. You can freely select the name. A domain is unique, i.e. the exact same domain may never be used twice. Therefore, when registering a desired domain, e.g. with a hosting service provider, it is necessary to check whether your desired domain has already been used.

For further information, refer to the page <<business-decisions/system-administration/domains#, Domains>>.

[#1200]
== Buying an SSL certificate

An SSL certificate is used to encrypt your website and provides a secure connection to your online shop. Your customers can see when you are using an SSL certificate as your website will be accessed via _https_.
It is important that the domain for which you want to order the SSL certificate is set as main domain.

For further information, refer to the page <<business-decisions/system-administration/ssl-certificate#, SSL certificates>>.

[#1300]
