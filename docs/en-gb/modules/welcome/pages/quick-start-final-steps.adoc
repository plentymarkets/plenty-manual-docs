== Unlocking the webshop

Now you are almost done. At the beginning of this quick start, we locked the webshop and ensured that all emails would be sent to our own address for testing purposes. Before starting business, we have to revert these settings.

Deactivating the test mode:

. Go to *Setup » Client » Standard Shop (Standard) » Email » Access data.*
. Select *Inactive* from the test mode drop-down list.
. *Save* the settings.

[.instruction]
Unlocking the webshop:

== More about the manual

As you continue to dive deeper into the plentymarkets system to extend your store, you will probably reference this manual somewhat frequently. There are two ways to navigate it: the navigation tree and the search function. Use the navigation tree on the left to explore the manual or to get an overview of an entire topic. Use the search function to look up specific key words.

[NOTE]
.Versions
====
The manual describes the functionality of plentymarkets systems according to the beta version. However, by default, new systems use the stable version. As a result, some parts of the manual may deviate from your system environment for up to two weeks.

If you want to switch to a different version, open your back end and go to *Setup » Client » Standard-Shop (Standard) » Version* for further information.
